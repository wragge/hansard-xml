The Air Accidents Investigation Committee is proceeding to Richmond at the present time, with a view to holding a full inquiry, and the Air Board is also making an investigation. I may remind the House that the Marshal of the Royal Air Force. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Ellington, arrived at Fremantle yesterday, accompanied by two senior staff officers. They will reach Melbourne to-morrow, and I shall take advantage of their visit by asking them to confer with our own experts in tho Royal Australian Air Force to see if any further light can be thrown upon the causes of the serious accidents that have taken place recently in connexion with the air force. </para>

          <para>- I am grateful to the honorable gentleman for having raised this subject, and I would ask- the indulgence of the House to make a short statement. - <inline font-style="italic">By leave</inline> - The Federal Council of the British Medical Association has asked that negotiations be re-opened on the agreement previously made, but the Government can have no security that any agreement reached by negotiations with the association would be accepted by the profession generally, and it cannot proceed on the basis of the demands now being made. The Government has, therefore, decided to set up a royal commission to advise it regarding the proper payment to be made for the treatment of persons insured under the national insurance measure. The Government intends also that the commission shall investigate the financial aspects of the voluntary provision of medical treatment for the wives and children of insured men, to whom the Government has promised some assistance.The commission will be constituted as soon as practicable, and it is intended that the friendly societies, as well as representative members of the medical profession and the National Insurance Commission, shall have every opportunity to submit evidence. </para>

            <para>- The House is entitled to be informed in greater detail of the terms of reference in which certain matters are to be submitted to the commission for inquiry. All we know, as far as I understand the statement of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> is that the commission is to inquire what would be fair remuneration of the medical practitioners for an unspecified service which they are to render to persons who are to be insured under the bill before the House. I understand that it is intended that the friendly societies shall be invited to give evidence on this matter. I suggest, however, that the commission&#39;s terms of reference should be wide enough, and the Parliament ought to be satisfied that they are wide enough, to ensure that there will be available to the Parliament, when the report is submitted, findings which adequately cover not only the remuneration which the doctors will get, but also the nature of the services which the contributors are to receive. Further, I take it - although at this juncture I cannot be sure on the matter - that the pharmaceutical service also should bo the subject of examination by the royal commission. It would appear that the Treasurer&#39;s statement has been made merely for the purpose of allaying the criticism which has been levelled against certain features of the proposed legislation. It does not convince us that the inquiry will be of a sufficiently comprehensive and precise nature as to afford guidance upon all the matters that are strictly relevant to the medical service aspect of the measure. At this juncture I would also say that, as a royal commission is once again to be invited to consider one phase of national insurance, the Government should give some indication as to whether or not, in its opinion, the inquiry will result in any radical disturbance of the actuarial basis upon which the bill has been computed. </para>

            <para>- Subject to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I submit that there is a Standing Order which covers the procedure which I have adopted. The appointment of a royal commission may have the effect of increasing the payments whichwe have been led to believe will be made to medical practitioners for the services that they will render. If that be so, either a greater burden will be cast on the consolidated revenue fund, or else, there is to be exacted from employers and employees a greater weekly contribution than that contemplated by the bill. In addition to measuring the value of the services of the medical practitioners, the commission ought to be authorized to inquire how far, if at all, the wages of the contributors warrant the exaction from them of1s. 6d. a week as their contribution towards the institution of a system of national insurance. As the Government has now decided upon a further inquiry into this subject, I submit that that inquiry should be sufficiently comprehensive to deal with all the matters that have been deliberated upon by the committee, but in respect of which we have not been able to come to a decision because the facts are not available to us. If it be true that the medical practitioners are dissatisfied with the rates of pay which it was intended to give to them, and if, in the opinion of the Government that is a matter for inquiry, ought not the proposed scale of contributions also be submitted to investigation ? No one has yet examined whether or not it is fair to charge employers 1s. 6d. a week in respect of each employee. Nor do we know what the impact of this charge upon industry will be. If certain phases of this actuarial structure are to be reconsidered, other relevant phases relating to the finances of the measure should also be reviewed. </para>

        <para class="block">That Standing Order does not refer to a statement made by a Minister in answer to a question, or to one for which leave has been obtained, even though he had read the whole of it. I do not think that the Standing Order could possibly refer to such a statement as that made by the Treasurer to-day. I may say that, had I anticipated a discussion of this nature, I should not have allowed the statement in the first place. It appeared, however, that it was being made at the wish of the House. It certainly anticipates debate upon an order of the day, although that is not the point at issue now. </para>

            <para>- I submit that the Treasurer obtained leave to make a statement and that, in making it, he quoted from a document relating to public affairs. The substance of the statement was that the Government intends to establish a royal commission. Surely that is a matter which comes within the ambit of the words &#34; relating to public affairs &#34;. I also submit that the document was &#34; quoted from by a Minister of the Crown&#34;. He did not say that it was &#34; of a confidential nature &#34;. As a matter of &#39;fact, it was the very opposite of a statement of a confidential nature, because it was a statement announcing Government policy. I submit that the difference between my motion, that the document be tabled, and the phraseology of the Standing Order, that it &#34;may be called for&#34;, is a difference without substance; both mean the same thing. If a motion that a document be called for be carried, obviously that means that the Minister must table it, and the phraseology of Standing Order 317 contemplates the procedure which I have initiated. If my motion be not considered satisfactory, another course will be taken. </para>

            <para>- It appears to the Chair that Standing Order 317 does not refer to a case such as that now under consideration. The Treasurer was asked if he had any information to give to the House as to the procedure that would be adopted in dealing with certain matters. He asked for leave to make a statement, and he then told the House what he intended to do. He read from a paper which I do not think can be termed a document in the sense contemplated by the Standing Order. As I had never heard of a previous similar instance, I deferred giving a decision, but I do so now, because I do not think that it can be assumed that the Standing Order refers to a case such as this and, therefore, I rule that the Leader of the Opposition may not proceed further. </para>

            <para>- I think that the honorable gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension.So far, the work of the geophysical and geological survey has been of general interest and a great deal of most useful information both positive and negative, has been disclosed, but it is hardly fair to say that there has been any spectacular find. I can see no reason why the work of one well-equippedgeo- logical and geophysical body should be referred to another geologist for his opinion. </para>

              <para>- The area in question is a reclaimed area, where it would not be practicable to erect large brick buildings.. Plans and specifications of the control building were submitted to the council for their information, and to meet the wishes: of the council we have decided to use corrugated fibro-cement for all the buildings. The original intention was to use galvanized iron for the roofing of the hangar. There will be no grounds for complaint. Every effort is being made to avoid anything ofan unsightly nature, but only two materials could be used, one being galvanized iron and the other corrugated fibro-cement. We have chosen the latter in deference to the wishes of the council and the community. </para>

            <para>- I have been informed that statements of the nature referred to by the honorable member have appeared in to-day&#39;s Melbourne press. They are, however, quite incorrect. The locomotives recently provided for use on that section of the trans-Australian railway are still new and are not yet properly run in. Some slight troubles have occurred necessitating certain adjustments. The story that they are unsuitable for the service, and have had to be withdrawn from commission, is entirely without foundation. </para>

The stipulations in respect of labour arc those usually made in such cases, and are to the effect that the contractor shall observe award conditions. Plans are being prepared for additional works adjacent to and in conjunction with the new fortifications at Fort Wallace. The works in contemplation should be completed within this financial year or, at any rate, within twelve months. It is anticipated that regular employment will be provided for between 130 and 140 men for twelve months, and that additional men will be engaged for certain periods during that time. </para>

            <para>- The conditions under which&#39; recruits are admitted to the militia force are not now as rigid as they once were, having been eased some years ago. The view has been expressed, and I agree with it, that it is to the advantage of the Commonwealth that even those persons who are not 100 per cent. physically fit should be encouraged to join the militia, in order that they may derive full advantage from the physical training available to them in that service. The honorable gentleman has directed attention to certain criticism against only a very small minority of trainees. These may, perhaps, not be quite up to the desired standard, hut they are, nevertheless, physically fit in the true sense of the term. </para>

          <para>In the early part of the present year the Italian cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Raimondo Montecuccoli</inline> was lying alongside the pier at Port Melbourne. She was a guest of the Australian Government. Indeed, as a ship of war, she could not have entered an Australian harbour other than as a guest or in furtherance of warlike operations. By the courtesy of those in charge of the vessel it was thrown open for inspection by visiting Australians, a great number of whom availed themselves of the opportunity thus presented, and went on board. On the 15th February of  the  present year one Frigo Orlando, by occupation a hire-car driver, many years resident in Australia, married to an Australian girl, and the father of children born in this country, went on board that warship as a visitor. It was natural that he should do so, as he had long been separated from his native land. Having boarded the vessel, he stood for a moment inspecting the first thing which aroused his interest. Then, in compliance with the request, &#34; This way, please,&#34; addressed at large to the visitors on board, he accompanied others down a narrow passageway. Here he was set upon by certain of the ship&#39;s ratings. He was struck upon the head, and hustled about.  His  face was prodded with a pointed instrument like a funnel. Generally, he received a severe manhandling, and was covered with blood. I am able, from personal observation, to depose as to the nature of his injuries, because I saw him a couple of days after the assault had occurred.  His  face was then an interesting mosaic of scabs and sticking plaster, and it was evident that he had been very severely handled. The other visitors who were in the vicinity when the assault took place, dispersed, doubtless finding the welcome too warm  for them, and Orlando was conducted by an officer into a private room, where he was attended to by a ship&#39;s doctor - as far as is known, in an efficient manner. Eventually, he was allowed to leave the ship. As the result of the assault &#39; he lost his earning power, to the detriment of himself, his wife, and his family, in addition to having suffered the personal injuries that I have described. There does not appear to be any dispute on the facts up to that point, or, indeed, on any of the facts which I am narrating. I know of none, not having heard from the Government on the subject. While in the private room to which he was taken, Orlando was interviewed by an officer of the ship, who cross-examined him as to his activities in Australia. Incidentally, this officer showed that he had a very accurate knowledge of the conduct and political practices of this person, and ventured the unsolicited information that he was aware that Orlando had been associated with the  Matteotti  Club, but it was to his credit that he had long since dissociated himself from that body. So much apparently was to the good. At that stage in the inquiry a Commonwealth investigation officer merely made some visual observations and retired. That led a number of us to believe that the life story of this Italian was. known to this Commonwealth officer and had been supplied to the Commonwealt&#39;h. Well, the one courtesy for which we have to thank the Government in the matter is that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> at a later stage assured us that that was not so. I accept his assurance on that point. I, myself, cross-examined Orlando as to the incident and as to certain vague reports which I had heard of minor conflicts which it was alleged had taken place between Italian ratings and certain persons of Communist opinion in the suburbs of Melbourne. It was even suggested among the vague reports made about the matter, that the victim had circulated printed matter on the ship itself. There is no evidence, so far as I know or have been able to ascertain, in support of that. It  seems to me to be a palpable untruth. Orlando himself states that he has been in Australia for many years, that he </para>
          <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Brennan.</inline> had taken no part in politics at . all for a considerable time previously, that his interests were entirely confined to his calling, and that for the purposes of his employment he cultivated all classes of Italians, because, naturally, he thought he was more likely to get support from them than from others. He assured me that he had been in no brawl of anykind with any member of the ship&#39;s crew, and that he was at least one mile away from a minor disagreement which was alleged to have taken place in a club in one of the suburbs, and had no connexion with it whatever. In considering what is really the major question, I think it seems to be agreed between myself and the Attorney-General, that these details are comparatively unimportant. The major question is: Was this Australian resident, with or without provocation, set upon in contempt of the law and grievously injured? I have thought it necessary to refer to these unimportant details because so many persons are inclined to decide issues of substance by reference to purely extraneous considerations. The fact is, that within call of the police, and within sight of the law courts with their legend engraven on their floor space &#34; Let justice be .done though the heavens may fall &#34;, this man was so maltreated, and has had no more notice taken of it and has had no more recourse to law than if he had been a dog whipped by any person who thought fit to do so. He has had less consideration of his case than perhaps a dog would receive, because if a dog were ill-treated, a prosecution might be launched under the law which deals with cruelty to animals. Apparently, in connexion with this working class individual of Australia, no such protective law exists. There is the familiar attitude pf mind in such cases which prompts the statement, &#34; Oh, there must have been some reason for this; men do not set upon their fellow men without provocation or excuse of some kind &#34;. Of course, my first answer to &#39;that is that, even if provocation were proven, it would not justify hooliganism and lynch law in an Australian port. My second answer is that, if an explanation is called for, it would more appropriately come from the assailant rather than from the person assaulted. No  authoritative statement has been made on behalf of the ship&#39;s command. It is true that, apart altogether from the ship&#39;s command, there has been speculation and gossip which, as is usual in these cases, has run rife; but no one has ever attempted to submit in evidence one single fact which might be urged even in extenuation of the incident which I have already described. If Orlando&#39;s conduct on the ship were objectionable, the highly disciplined organization on the vessel was quite equal to .deal with him. He should have been restrained and, if necessary, contumeliously ejected, from the ship, or dealt with in any way considered appropriate by the organization on board the vessel. There is no evidence that steps of that nature were taken by the. ship&#39;s command. As to his alleged association with the political cult known as communism, the truth is that neither communism, fascism, nor even ordinary tory imperialism arises in this case. In my view, it is intolerable to think that officers or ratings of a visiting warship should presume to discipline in Australia a resident Australian for his political opinions and, especially, by recourse to lynch law. I point out that the protection which we ask be afforded to an Italian national is not an unfriendly act towards the Italian Government, but is rather a friendly gesture. J am proud to be able to add that it is not the first time I have been associated with my fellow-members of the Labour party in (protecting Italian nationals in this country. On the other hand, visiting Italian sailors, of whatever rank, are assured of the protection of the laws of Australia when they .come here, and if one of them were subjected to attack or to public insult he could rely on the laws of this country being invoked for his protection, and even applied with a large measure of sympathy because of the fact that he was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> visitor to Australia. Meantime, however, there remains Orlando&#39;s emphatic denial of any impropriety of conduct, or of any association with politics, or of any offence whatever. It has been suggested that it was a case of mistaken identity. It may have been. It seems pretty certain that he was recognized as being an Italian national resident in Aus tralia. Even if it was a case of mistaken, identity, that furnishes the stronger^ reason why his case should be taken upand some compensation paid to him foi&#34; what he has suffered. The policeauthorities, on being informed, .said that they could do nothing; and I think they were right. A visiting warship in Australian waters carries with it the law of&#34; the country from which it comes. It is aminiature foreign territory in the country where it is a visitor. Process cannot beserved upon it, nor can an arrest of an offender be made upon it. That, of course, raises the very delicate question, which I do not propose to discuss on this occasion, as to the propriety of entertaining  warships  as emissaries of goodwill. A deputation consisting of my friends of the Labour party and myself waited upon the AttorneyGeneral and made representations to him. They asked, first, that the matter should be inquired into. It  may  be that the Investigation Branch knows much more about it than I do,  and  all I say &#39;is that we are entitled to  know  what can be said in explanation or excuse. We asked the Attorney-General  for  such an inquiry, and we suggested that  if  the facts were as I have indicated, some compensation should be asked for in favour of Orlando from those who had done him this wrong, and that, failing compensation at their hands, the Commonwealth Government should compensate him, not because it was liable on  legal  grounds, but because it should, on  moral  grounds, compensate a man whohad been injured by the agents of a friendly foreign power. I have no reason to suppose that the Government of Italy would fall short, on proper representations being made, of what is reasonably required of a civilized people. Italy has a tradition of culture and politeness that goes much deeper than its present form of government. On another occasion I referred to some unfortunate consequences of this incident. &#39;I pointed out that it was a most regrettable thing that the incident had unleashed violent attacks on the Italian Government. </para>

            <para>.- The  honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> has moved this motion for a purpose which, no doubt, he was unable to divulge to the people of Australia owing to his having exhausted the time allotted to speeches on motions for adjournment of the House. The facts regarding the incident on the Italian cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Raimondo Montecuccoli</inline> are not in dispute. The honorable member has referred, however, only to some of these. There are other facts which he did not mention. He led the House to believe that the assault upon Orlando was gratuitous, but that is not so, and I feel sure that the honorable member, upon reflection, will realize that there must have been in the minds of the ratings on the Italian ship some cause for their action; some provocation which explained, although it could not justify, the assault. As to whether Orlando himself had been associated with those persons responsible for the acts which the sailors on the warship so strongly resented, I express no opinion. There is no evidence to support such a contention. Orlando himself denied that he had taken any part in these demonstrations. However, that there had been provocation is undeniable. While the ship was in Sydney, for example, the officers and men from the cruiser were greeted at a meeting in the Paddington Town Hall by a demonstration from gentlemen who profess communist opinions. They greeted the guests on that occasion with cries of &#34;Down with Mussolini ! &#34; and &#34; Stop the Italian invasion of Spain ! &#34; Other demonstrations followed. There was one in Melbourne before the news of the assault upon Orlando became known, and I believe that an effigy of Mussolini was burnt. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Batman is ever ready to exude vitriolic criticism from that side of the House, but when he is asked to accept criticism himself, he does not like it. This was a case of common assault on an Australian citizen. Had it occurred on shore, little or nothing would have been heard of it. In any case, the police would have dealt with it, and, had the matter come before a magistrate, the offenders might have been fined, or perhaps sentenced to a month&#39;s imprisonment. Such incidents take place every day in this happy land of ours. I venture to say that, in the electorate of the honorable member for </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Batman, many similar incidents occur every Saturday. As I have said, the four months that have intervened since the assault took place have witnessed events of immense importance to the _whole world. The nations have been tremblingon the verge of war, but the honorable&#34; member for Batman has been silent. Tens of thousands of helpless women, children and inoffensive non-combatants have been killed, but the honorable member has not raised his voice in protest. Yet we are asked to believe that his soul has been and still is so cruelly lacerated by the assault on Orlando that he has moved this motion. Why? It is true that Orlando was suspected of being a communist, but he himself swore that he had turned his back on that creed. He had abandoned it ten years ago, we are told, and, since then, had devoted himself to his business. Frigo Orlando was assaulted four months ago : the assault was unjustifiable : but let us consider the incident in proper perspective; let us look at it in relation to the great, urgent, and vitally important problems which are confronting Australia and other nations&#39; which, we cannot ignore. The honorable member for Batman has brought this matter forward with the object of ventilating, what he terms, &#34; a cruel injustice &#34; - of righting a great wrong. I shall always be amongst the first to stand out for justice to all men. I regret as much as he does that any person - guest, visitor, or citizen - should take the law into his own hands. But I repeat that we must look at this incident in proper perspective. As I have said, the months that have elapsed since the incident on the cruiser have been pregnant with great events. Some of these bear directly on the relations between Italy and Britain. Since the incident .occurred, negotiations set on foot for an Anglo-Italian agreement some three months ago have been happily concluded by a pact which represents the greatest contribution towards the appeasement of Europe and general world peace that has been made for many years. It is of the utmost possible importance to the Empire, as it ensures, equilibrium in the Mediterranean and freedom of commerce in that region find through the Suez Canal to Australia. </para>

I have only to say that members of the Opposition have themselves to blame. In the second-reading debate, 50&#189; hours were occupied in the discussion of the bill, and, in the committee, the measure has already been discussed for 29 hours. A period of practically80 hours has been devoted to the consideration of the measure, and much time has been wasted by tedious repetition. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has now submitted a motion for an allotment of time that will provide for additional discussion over a period of 20&#189; hours. Therefore, when the bill has been finally disposed of, this House will have devoted 100 hours to its discussion and consideration. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Lyons) that honorable members have taken up too. much time of the House cannot, I think, be applied to me. Of the 61 speeches delivered on the second reading of the bill, about 25 came from members of the Opposition. That is my answer to the charge that the Opposition has wasted time. I rise to intervene at this point, because the motion seems to me to be entirely unfair. Apart from the time to be allotted to the discussion during the remaining stages of the bill, surely honorable members, other than the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> are entitled to have amendments considered and voted upon. They represent the people quite as much as any Minister does. If the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> is defeated, no member of the Opposition will have the slightest opportunity to have an amendment voted upon.We have had experience of the guillotine in operation. The time allotted in each period would provide for discussion on only one or two clauses, and the remaining clauses would be voted upon <inline font-style="italic">en masse;</inline> but the amendments introduced by the Treasurer would bo voted upon automatically. I object to the rights and privileges to be taken by the Treasurer being denied to the Opposition. The Prime Minister has emphasized that, in his opinion, too much time has been occupied in the discussion of the bill; but, having listened attentively to most of the debate, I have observed so indication of stone-walling tactics. </para>

          <para>.- I support the protests of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin).</inline> The latter rightly pointed out that the number of members on the Government side who spoke on the second reading of the bill was larger than the number of speakers on the Opposition side. I am not objecting to that, because Government supporters have their rights; but I find that, in the committee, there were 73 speeches from Government supporters and 76 by members of the Opposition. Allowing for both the second reading and the committee stages, 108 speeches were delivered by Government supporters, and 104 by members of the Opposition, which shows that no organized stonewalling has occurred on this side of the chamber. In introducing the bill, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> announced that it was one of the most important measures ever submitted to Parliament, and that it marked the beginning of another epoch in the history of the Commonwealth. Is there any justification, therefore, for stifling discussion of a proposal that will directly affect 1,800,000 members of the community? The Government should bear in mind that members of the Opposition have their rights and responsibilities, and that they represent the people as much as do honorable members who support the Government. If the party now in office deprives the Opposition of its rights in matters of this kind, its action may result in repercussions when a change of government takes place. There shouldbe the freest discussion on matters of such far-reaching importance as this bill. Although the Government obtained a majority in this chamber at the last elections, the policy submitted by the Opposition won the approval of the people in the Senate contest in five out of the six States. Consequently, members of the Opposition are fully justified in demanding their rights as representatives of the people. The Opposition has given long and serious consideration to this measure and, as the result, 21 amendments to vital clauses have been drafted. If carried, those amendments would liberalize its provisions and grant additional benefits to deserving sections of the people who, under the bill as it stands, will not enjoy benefits to which the Opposition believes they are entitled. </para>

Are we to believe that, after all, those honorable members put up a sham fight, or did they mean what they said ? If they vote for this curtailment of debate, they will not have an opportunity to vote on the proposed amendments. I assure the House that the amendments proposed by honorable members on this side, of which notice has been given, were carefully considered; they are not put forward merely with a desire to oppose. Members of the Opposition have their rights as representatives of the people. I strongly protest against the action of the Government in regard to such vital legislation; it makes a farce of the proceedings in this National Parliament. </para>

            <para>- When we reflect that the Government kept Parliament in recess for many months, when it could have been considering this legislation, the action of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to-day is the more reprehensible.  His  purpose is clear; he is endeavouring to defeat the expressed views of the electors, by having this measure dealt with by a Senate as now constituted, and not as it will be after the 1st July, when the Government will not have in the other chamber the slavish following that exists there now. </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out the motive underlying the proposals of the Treasurer. I emphatically protest against any action which will prevent members of the Opposition from moving amendments which have been suggested by various sections of the community. Elected representatives of the people hav: their rights in this chamber, even though they sit in opposition to the Government. If actions of this kind are allowed to pass without protest, Australia will no longer be able to boast that it is a free democracy. The Government is deserving of the severest censure for this abuse of power. The country should know that in the discussion that has already taken place on this measure, supporters of the Government have spoken longer, and on more occasions, than have members of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>. - This hill has already been before the chamber for a considerable time. After the second-reading speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> had been delivered, the resumption of the debate was postponed for a fortnight at the express request of the Opposition. If my memory serves me rightly, a second extension of time was granted, in order that the Opposition might have ample opportunity to consider the merits of the bill. It was given ample opportunity to understand the proposals of the Government. </para>

            <para>- On the second reading, members of the Opposition availed themselves fully of the opportunity to let the country know their views regarding the bill. From the stand adopted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> this afternoon, it would appear that, in his opinion, the later the country knows about the measure, the  better. The  Deputy  Leader of the Oppo*sition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said that the number of Government supporters who had spoken to this measure exceeded that of members of the Opposition, but I point out that there are 44 members sitting on this side of the House, compared with 30, including one &#34; clean-skin &#34;, on the other side. That shows that the Government has a good majority in this chamber. </para>

Should a private member, after having been named by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and after an appeal had been made to him to do so, refuse to withdraw a statement to which exception has been taken, it is the duty of the Leader of the House to move that he be suspended from the service of the House.

          <para>.- I think that before we proceed any further the Government should undertake to insert a provision in the bill to ensure that an employee who has actually made his contributions shall be entitled to all the benefits of the bill notwithstanding the failure of his employer to make his contributions. Otherwise it is perfectly obvious that, by refusing or neglecting to make his contributions, a dishonest employer could deprive his employees of the health benefits provided under this measure. </para>

          <para>.- I again ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> for an assurance that the point I referred to a moment ago will be covered. A provision should be inserted in the bill to make it quite clear that an employee shall not be deprived of his benefits by reason of the fact that a dishonest or negligent employer may have omitted to pay his contributions. I understand that, it is suggested that the employee will be sufficiently protected if an amendment is made to clause 177, but under that clause it seems that an employee will be required to take action against the employer in a civil court for damages, and if the employer subsequently becomes bankrupt it shall be assumed that the employer&#39;s contributions have been paid. That, however, would be small satisfaction to a workman. It would be utterly unfair to put employees to the expense of taking action for damages in such a case. A provision should be included in this clause to the effect that, if an employee can establish definitely that he has paid his contributions, no negligence, dishonesty or failure on the part of the employer should be able to disqualify him. from benefits. </para>

          <para>.- Will the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> inform me how it is proposed to insure that employers shall not deduct the amount of their contribution from the wages of the employees? Itis common knowledge that many employers throughout Australia pay substantially below the award rates of wages. The clause makes no provision to protect employees from unscrupulous employers. How does the Treasurer propose to police this provision? Hundreds of employers throughout Australia have had to be prosecuted for paying their employees less than award rates. Frequently employees have a pay-sheet put in front of them with an instruction to &#34; Sign here &#34;, and they sign for a certain amount of wages although they may have received a great deal less than the amount stated. It is essential that some proper protection should be given to employees in this matter, otherwise unscrupulous employers will simply deduct an additional1s. 6d. a week from each of their employees and so will get  offscot-free. </para>

          <para>.- I consider that many employers will deduct from the wages of their employees the amount of the employer&#39;s contribution. Whether it is done in that direct way or not, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that some manufacturers will undoubtedly increase the price of their commodities to recoup their costs under the law. So the employees will, in a roundabout way, have to pay not only their own contributions but also those of the employers. Does the Treasurer propose to do anything to stay the hands of employers who increase commodity prices as an offset against the additional costs that will be imposed upon their businesses after this measure becomes law? I ask the honorable gentleman at least to give an assurance that the terms of reference to the royal commission will enable an inquiry to be made into this point. </para>

          <para>.- Many employees throughout Australia are not protected by law in respect of the wages they receive. This clause should be of value to employees who work under awards or wages board determinations, but I do not see how it can protect in any way employees working under a verbal agreement or whose wages are not subject to some written contract. An employer who wished to avoid making the contribution required of him under this measure could say to employees not covered by awards or written contracts of some kind : &#34; I should have been prepared to engage you at a wage of 30s. a week had it not been for the National Health Insurance and Pensions Act, but; as it is, I am not prepared now to offer you more than 28s. 6d. a week &#34;. It may be that every aspect of employment cannot be covered by the act, but Ishould like the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to givean undertaking that he will endeavour to tighten up this clause in some respects. 1 am not suggesting that he should propose an amendment at the moment, nor shall I propose one, but the position of persons whose wages are not covered by an award or contract of some kind should be protected as far as possible. </para>

          <para>. - Where employees are working u n del&#39; a verbal agreement as to wages, and no wages book is kept, it seems to me that it will be impossible to give adequate protection. No provision could police a situation of that description. Even if a complaint should be made to  mi  inspector that an employer had made illegal deductions from the wages of his employees, it would not be possible to obtain proof. Section 173 provides penalties in respect of failure to comply with the provisions of the act, hut I cannot see that anything effective can be clone when there is no means to determine beyond dispute the amount of wages to which a particular employee is entitled. </para>

            <para>- It does not. Thousands of men cannot obtain employment unless they sign for a greater payment than they receive. So immoral is the profitmongering system that private enterprise is able to take advantage of the economic position of the workers. Cases of the kind that. I have described are exposed in the courts day after day. Therefore, even where wages are regulated by law, there is no check on the dishonest employer. I agree with the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> that the employer will recover by means of increased prices the amount that he is compelled to contribute under this legislation. Whenever arbitration courts increase the purchasing power of the workers, or any other action is taken which involves additional&#39; ; expenditure, the capitalist reimburses himself by raising prices. Therefore, it is useless to say that the employer will pay one penny by way of contribution under this scheme. The Treasurer should not hide his head in the sand. He is as well acquainted as anybody else with the fact that private enterprise indulges in immoral practices. Nothing that either he or any other honorable member of the committee may say can disprove the fact that this scheme, instead of being a burden on, will be a benefit to, the employer. When fixing his prices, he will arrange not only to recoup himself for his expenditure by means of these contributions, but also to make his customary profit on that outlay. If his usual rate of profit is 25 per cent, and his contributions aggregate &#163;400, he will so fix prices as to secure a return of &#163;500. I notice that one or two honorable members are smiling. They are members of that class, and they stand for that kind of morality in private business because they have profited by it. This will be a burden on the consumers of the country, and, as the workers represent 90 per cent, of the consumers, they will pay not only their own contributions, but alio the contributions of the employers and the Government. This crazy system of exploitation will continue until the people make up their minds to establish a form of civilization which will be entirely apart from the profitmongering system.- </para>

          <para>.-When an honorable member asks the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> a particular question, he should endeavour to answer it. The clause says definitely that the employer shall not recover contributions from the employee. In what way does the Government propose to prevent him from doing so? The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has followed the argument that I have already advanced. The captains of industry will recover the amount of the contributions they are compelled to make under this provision by raising the prices of commodities. The honorable member for Werriwa comes from a coal-mining centre, and his experience has been similar to mine. When, on one occasion, under an Arbitration Court award, the coal owners were obliged to increase by ls. Cd. a day the wages of 50 per cent, of their employees, they raised the price of coal by ls. Cd. a ton. Throughout the coal mining industry the whole of the employees, from manager down to trapper boy, produce three tons of coal a day. At the time to which I refer, I appeared before the Coal Board as the representative of the miners, and was able to show that the rake-off of the employers in excess of the additional charge imposed on them by the Arbitration Court award, amounted to over &#163;900,000 per annum. As the honorable member for Werriwa has pointed out, the employers will not be content with recovering merely the amount they have had to contribute, but in addition will make a profit on their outlay. In what way does the Treasurer propose to prevent such a practice? Will he try to make it impossible to increase prices, or has he come to some agreement with the employers? The friendly societies and the medical profession have representatives in Canberra who are watching their interests during the consideration of this measure, because they are materially affected, but the -great captains of industry are not represented because they know that they have no need to worry. The Treasurer ably represents their interests and is merely trying to delude the people with a clause of this nature. The uninsured, as well as the insured, will bear the burden. This will be an- excuse for the employers to profiteer, and they will have no hesita tion in availing themselves of the opportunity to do so. Even after six months of preparation, the Government now finds it necessary to submit portions of the bill to a royal commission. Will the .commission be asked to devote its attention to tins particular matter? Could it-suggest any effective action if the matter were referred to it? It is well known that the Government cannot prevent the raising of the prices of commodities under- its present limited constitutional powers. </para>

          <para>. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> has been talking in rather an extreme fashion. The price of commodities is almost completely determined by supply and demand. If, by reason of the operation of this legislation, or for any other reason, the prices of commodities are raised, that &#39;will be taken into account, because it will be reflected in the cost of living figures, which, in turn, affect the award, rates. Consequently, the matter will be adjusted automatically. </para>

          <para>.- In his economics, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is about 100 years behind the times. Those who know anything about modern economics know that the law of supply and demand was dynamited 50 or 100 years .ago. The honorable, gentleman has had sufficient experience in the business world to realize that it is only a joke. Cartels and monopolies in the big manufacturing industries control prices. The prices of everything which the people need are determined by the manufacturers. The retailer can charge no less than the price fixed; should he do so, his supplies would be discontinued. I have been in the business world for some time, and have experienced the bushrauging which goes on among the big concerns that control the supply of commodities. There may not be fixation of price in regard to a few commodities which do not count, but if one were to inquire in 50 different stores the prices of the main commodities which the people need, one would find that there was no variation between them. The Treasurer will not attempt to explain the matter, because litis unable to do so. Take the history of this country, from the first day when wages were regulated by law; take the history of the economic life of Australia ; from the first day on which there was intervention in the affairs of industry by means of measures of this or any other kind, in not one instance have the employers had their costs increased without recovering, not &#34;only the additional outJay, but also a profit on it. In this way, the coal industry raked off &#163;9,000,000 in about seven years. The prices of bread, meat, butter, eggs, cheese, clothing, and everything else, will be increased immediately this scheme is thrown into the economic arrangement of the nation. The Treasurer and every other member of the committee will find that that will be the case. If an employer has to pay out &#163;1,000 in contributions to this scheme he will add his profit of, say, 20 per cent, to the expenditure, and secure a return of &#163;1,200, because it cannot be denied that all large employers will add their expenditure in respect of contributions on behalf of their employees to the cost of all the commodities which they soil. Although that will be done in every big concern, those small farmers, whom Country party members wore so anxious to protect before they cast their vote to apply the guillotine to this measure so that they would not have an opportunity to speak on it again, will not bc able to pass their expenditure on. </para>

            <para>- These small farmers arc at a dead end. In every other succeeding line of the partial production of economic goods every penny of the cost will be added to the final price. At one end of the line of production you have the small farmers at a dead end in this respect, and at the other you have the workers who cannot pass on added expenditure to anybody. In between the two ends of the economic line are those who will be in a posi tion to add the cost of their contributions to the insurance fund to the price of everything they manufacture. Only those two classes in the community will he penalized in any way by having to surrender some of their purchasing power to establish the insurance funds. I challenge honorable members apposite, whose views are supposed to be supported by university professors, to debate the economics  of this scheme before any tribunal of sensible nien. The Treasure may bleat as much as he likes about this bill; he cannot get away from the fac! that the cost of national insurance will, in the final analysis, have to be met by only two sections of the community, the workers and the small farmers. </para>

          <para>.- I should like some explanation from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> as to how this clause will affect casual employees. The clause provides that a contribution shall be payable for each week during the whole or any part of which an employed contributor has been employed. Many casual employees during bad times may not receive more than one or two hours work each week. As the clause stands at present, it means that out of their meagre earnings of from 2s. to 4s. a week, those men will be obliged to make a contribution of ls. 6d. to the insurance fund. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> at an earlier stage gave reasons why, in his opinion, certain people in the community with incomes not exceeding &#163;208 per annum should be exempted from making contributions in respect of their employees. Equal consideration should be given to the claims of casual workers who are not in a position to make the contribution that will be demanded o* them under this clause. Their contributions should he borne by the Government either out of the &#39; Consolidated Revenue Fund or out of some other fund which the Government may determine. I am of the opinion that if this clause is permitted to be passed in its present form, it. will impose a distinct hardship on a section of those.workers who do not enjoy permanent employment. In my opinion they should be given the same measure of assistance as I understand it is proposed to give the section of the community for which the honorable member for Swan made his plea. </para>

          <para>. -  Sub-clause 1 provides that contributions shall, subject to the regulations, be payable weekly. In the ordinary course of events contributions will, in the large majority of cases, be paid weekly; but in those trades or occupations where it is usual to pay wages at intervals other than weekly, contributions covering the pay period will be accepted under the regulations, although primarily in the bill they are normally payable weekly. As to the point raised by the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> regarding the contributions of casual employees, I may mention that that does not arise under this clause. For the information of the honorable member, however, I may say that, for the purposes of the bill, intermittent employment for a day or a half-day is not considered as employment. </para>

        <para>Where there is no element of continuity in a man&#39;s work, his employment would come under the category of excepted employments outlined in the first schedule.

If he works for one employer one day and for other employers on other days, the contribution of his employers will be spread over the various employers. Many problems arise in connexion with casual and relief workers, and there are also many diverse types of employment in Australia in respect of hours of work and so on.

            <para>- I have not very much faith in the powers of commissions generally. We have all had too much experience of the sympathetic treatment meted out by commissions, such as the Repatriation Commission, in the past. Apparently a relief worker who works one week in three, or two weeks in five, will have to make contributions to the fund because he is in regular work at intervals. He will be called upon to contribute1s. 6d., not only in respect of those weeks during which he works, but also for those weeks in which he is unemployed. Obviously he could not be provided with a free insurance period during the weeks in which he is out of employment. </para>

          <para>.- I am not at all satisfied with the explanation the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has given in regard to the contributions of casual workers. Like the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> I am of the opinion that unless we can secure a satisfactory explanation now we will have no opportunity to do so at a later stage when the Government, with the aid of the &#34;guillotine &#34;, is rushing the bill through. The Government has accepted the ultimatum of the Country party that small business people and small farmers with incomes not exceeding  &#163;208  per annum shall not be required to contribute to the scheme in respect of their employees. Surely the Treasurer will not say that there is any justification for compelling casual workers to contribute to the insurance fund out of the few shillings each week they may earn because their employment is regular. I could give numerous instances of men who on many occasions have been engaged for only two or three hours a week, or perhaps one day a week. Provided they are able to secure that employment every week they will be called upon to contribute ls. Gd. to the insurance fund. Honorable members supporting the Government will have great difficulty in explaining this impost on this section of the community to the people of this country. It will be a great hardship on them. Because they are receiving less remuneration they will be penalized as compared with those in full work. Let me examine for a moment the position of waterside workers. They work a certain number of days a week, but by no stretch of the imagination can they be said to be regularly employed, for they are not. guaranteed employment on regular days each week. They are, in every sense of the word, casual employees ; yet the Treasurer is not able to give&#62;-a straight-forward answer to the question as to whether they will be covered by the provisions of the bill. Knowing the effect of the measure on the general community, I am hopeful that these persons will not be compelled to come within its scope. The majority of them are not earning very high wages, and they are not desirous of being insured under the bill, which, by making people pay for their social services, will relieve the budget and the Government&#39;s wealthy supporters outside Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I am discussing how the clause will detrimentally affect a certain section of workers... Members of the Labour party supported the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> and other members of the Country party, in their plea that small business people and farmers, who find, it difficult to make contributions, should be exempt from payment. The Country party and the United Australia party appear to have reached some sort of agreement on that point, and, to be logical, members of the Country party should now support, the . plea of the Labour party that many workers who do not receive even the basic wage should be exempt. For those low-paid workers who have come within the insurance field and have made some contributions to the scheme, but are unable to continue to contribute, the Government should make some provision to keep them in the scheme, if they so wish. The Government should postpone the clause so that consideration can be given to the request I have made. -Workers who receive low wages and are engaged in irregular employment should be given the same consideration as small business men and small farmers whose incomes do not exceed &#163;20S a year.

          <para>.- It is very evident that the utterances of the honorable member for East -Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> have got under the &#39;skin of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> who has retreated from the obvious obligation that rests upon him to explain the clause. He gave as a reason for not explaining the clause that the honorable member for East Sydney had made reference to an inter-party arrangement and had resorted to abuse. The honorable member represents an electorate where there is a large section of unskilled workers, most of whom are employed on the waterside, and he would bc remiss in his duty to his electors if he did not satisfy himself that those workers are properly provided for in the hill.  His  argument that when a man does not make a reasonable wage he should not be  taxed is logical and reasonable. Surely if it is logical to say that an employer or farmer, who has some assets outside, the profits he makes, should not be called upon to pay contributions unless he earns &#163;20S a year, it is also logical to treat the working man in the same way. In the vast majority qf . cases the working man has no other asset than his labour, and he ought to be given at least the same concessions as the small business man or farmer. The Treasurer has invited us to wait until we are considering the schedule,&#39; when, he says, we shall discover how these persons will be treated. I regret that the Treasurer is not here at the moment to answer the questions I propose to put to him. I have examined the schedule, and I can find no provision in it covering waterside workers or other casual workers. The Treasurer said that if a man obtained half a day&#39;s work digging a garden, or other work of that character, and did it regularly, he would have to pay the tax. Apparently the Treasurer does not understand  Part  II. of the first schedule of the bill, where persons who do work of that character are distinctly and definitely excluded. As the Treasurer has tried to stall off the committee. until a later stage of the proceedings, it is interesting to note that in the schedule workers who are casually employed digging gardens  are  definitely exempt. I can find no reference in the schedule to the vast army of workers in industry who depend on casual .labour for their livelihood. I should say that we are justified in demanding for that section of the community the same consideration as has been promised for primary producers. If any section of the community receiving wages that do not amount to a reasonable sum is entitled to consideration, that section is the one referred to by the honorable member for East Sydney. I suggest that the committee, if it wishes to do simple justice to that section, would be well advised to postpone the clause. There is nothing in Part II. of the first schedule that would exempt the large bodies of men mentioned by the honorable member for East Sydney. The reason why the Treasurer has gone off in such high dudgeon, after referring to the speech of the honorable member for East Sydney as abuse, is that he wishes to evade a particularly knotty problem, and hopes that the committee will suspend judgment until the schedule is reached, when it may be impossible to do anything on the lines desired. </para>

          <para>.- I regret that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> is not present to hear this discussion. The clause is one of the most important in the bill. It is a clause under which some measure of even-handed justice can be done to certain sections of the .community. The honorable members for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> have mentioned waterside workers. Those men are employed from time to time for part of a fortnight, part of a week, part of a day, or perhaps only part of an bour. If it is right that the Government should give special consideration to small business men earning an income of less than  &#163;208  per annum, it is likewise desirable that casual workers and others doing only intermittent work should be exempt. Let me state the case for men who work for primary producers. At different times &#39;they are timber workers, potato diggers, harvest workers, and fruit pickers. They engage in every branch of primary production, often for exceedingly low rates of pay. If there is a case for exemption of any class, there is one for this class. If a concession is given to employers earning less than  &#163;208  per annum, it should be given also to employees earning less than that amount. The Labour party ought to be able to look for some reciprocity from the Country party on this occasion. We have indicated our willingness to support the Country party regarding employers e.arning less than  &#163;208  per annum, and -vo now ask them to support our claim for consideration for employees earning less than  &#163;208  per annum, and particularly for those in intermittent employment. The contributions for such workers should be met out of Consolidated Revenue. -Compare their position with that of the primary producers. Low as may be the incomes of the primary producers from time to time, at least they have a roof over their heads. The cow always has a drop of milk, and usually there is a pig in the sty. If everything else fails, there is a rabbit to be had, and firewood is probably available. But the man in industry, earning less than  &#163;208  a year, whether it be on casual or permanent work, has no resources of that kind to fall back on. When his income ceases, the demand for rent goes on,, and he must pay for all the commodities he uses. The milkman. the baker, the butcher, and the other tradesmen must all be paid. Therefore, I suggest to the Treasurer that if he has any justice at all in his make-up - and I believe he has - he will give consideration to the representations I have made. If he will not, then this Government can no longer claim that it stands for evenhanded &#39;justice to all citizens. The Treasurer should make a declaration now that all those in receipt of less than  &#163;208  a year will be exempt. It is unfair to grant the exemption to one class, and deny it to another. </para>

          <para>. -  Some further explanation is needed regarding the stipulated period of employment in any one week. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has pointed out how this provision will adversely affect a large body of workers in Australia, including the waterside workers. It will . particularly affect the waterside workers of Queensland, because they already come under the Unemployment Insurance Act in that State. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> mentioned the case of casual workers who receive perhaps only one day&#39;s work a week. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has stated &#39; that, provided such persons receive that one day a week regularly, they would be regarded as regular workers, and would be required to contribute. That is most unjust. In Queensland, there is a system of relief work in operation under which single men receive only one day&#39;s work a week, yet out of that one day&#39;s wages they will, under this scheme, be required to contribute ls. 6d. </para>

          <para>.- The longer this bill is under consideration the more convinced I am that it has no merits whatever. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has just admitted that a gardener who is employed for only one day a week, provided he obtains that employment regularly, must contribute ls. 6d. under the scheme. That is the most iniquitous form of class taxation that has ever been imposed on the workers of Australia. We have heard the representatives of the poor farmers complaining that primary producers who receive incomes of less than &#163;208 a year should be exempt, but what of the worker with a wife and five children who is drawing sustenance, and receiving one day&#39;s casual work a week? The position of the waterside workers has been discussed by various honorable members. Consider the case of a man who is picked up on Monday morning to do four hours&#39; work oh a shift. Out of the wage he receives for that work, he must pay his contribution to the insurance scheme. Then he is picked up again on Wednesday morning by another employer, and works through until midday on Saturday, yet the second employer need make no contribution to the fund. This is class taxation of the worst kind. </para>

        <para class="block">Surely that means that if a person has been employed for a part of a week he shall be responsible for a week&#39;s contribution. Many casual employees are in a very serious financial position, and many of them are infinitely worse off than the small farmers on &#39; whose behalf such a strong and successful appeal was made by the members of the Country party. Casual employees cannot acquire their own homes, and being in receipt of small incomes, find it very difficult to so maintain a family. Honorable members opposite should realize that those on whose behalf I am speaking are the backbone of the nation in that they are rearing large families and assuming the responsibilities of citizenship to a much greater extent than the wealthy section of the community who, while living in luxury, maintain only small families. I trust that honorable members opposite will be consistent and will support the postponement of this clause to enable the Government to give further consideration to the claims of casual workers. </para>

          <para>.- This clause will operate very awkwardly in that it may prevent the average employer from engaging casual workers. Employers will be induced to work their permanent staffs overtime as an alternative to engaging men on a casual basis for one or two days a week. If an employer should work his men at over-time rates without adding to his staff, he will not be involved in additional cost; but should he engage men for two days a week he will have to pay an additional ls. 6d. in respect of each casual employee so engaged, with the result that the rate of wage for those days will be increased by ls. 6d., and the worker who receives say, only one day&#39;s pay a week, will also have his earnings reduced by that amount. </para>

            <para>- No. The honorable member imagines that the position is covered by clause IS 6, but that is only an enabling provision under which the GovernorGeneral may declare the conditions under which the act will apply in respect of employed persons engaged in casual or intermittent work. That clause does not clarify the point at all. As a matter of fact, it leaves the whole matter completely in the air because we do not know what conditions the GovernorGeneral may impose. The schedule to which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> referred, also leaves the position vague and indefinite. </para>

        <para class="block">Obviously the purpose of the clause is that where a man gets a day&#39;s work, he shall, as an insured person, pay1s. 6d. weekly, as that is the weekly contribution of the employee, which has to be supplemented by the amount the employer will have to pay. The contribution is essentially a tax, and our objection to it is that the tax is computed on the assumption that a full week&#39;s work has been performed by the insured person ; but in this instance a tax is being imposed regardless of whether an employee works for a part of a week or for the whole week. Even if an employee should not work for a whole week, he will have to pay the full rate of tax for a week. All the exemptions contemplated are nebulous and indefinite, and a case for the postponement of the clause has been established. </para>

In the circumstances provision has to be made by regulations.

          <para>. - This  is an  important clause  to  which, earlier  in  the discussion, the Leader  of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> sought  to  move an amendment. This scheme,  to be  national  in  scope, should include provision for the wives and children of insured persons,  at  least  in  respect  of  medical benefits. During the afternoon the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> gave what was described  as a  &#34;Dorothy Dix&#34; reply  to  aninquiry by  an  honorable  member,  when  he  stated that  it  was the intentionof the Government  to  appoint  a  royal commission  to  inquire into and report upon this aspect  of  the scheme; but his statement did not satisfy honorable  members on  this side.  The  Government should insert  in  this bill the necessary provisions. For the payment  of1s.  6d.  a  week members  of  friendly societies, their wives and children  up to  the age  of  fourteen years, get a full range  of  medical benefits; in addition, a funeral allowance is made for both husband and wife. This national scheme should give the same range  of  benefits  to  all contributors. A well-known medical practitioner informed me that the wives and families  of  members  of  friendly societies require the services  of  doctors much more often than do the members themselves. </para>

          <para>.- I support the amendment to postpone consideration of the clause as an instruction to the Government to have it redrafted so as to include at least medical benefits for the wives and children of insured persons. Because the Government has a majority, it can ignore the claims of wives and children, but it will not be very long before the wives, at any rate, will have something to say in this matter. This measure is called a national health insurance bill, but, I suggest, the Government&#39;s only purpose in introducing it is to ensure that the wage-earner may be patched up like a piece of old machinery, in order to fit him to keep his nose to the grindstone. This measure has not been inspired by humanitarian motives; it is founded on base commercialism, and is primarily designed to keep the wageearner fit enough to earn more profits for the boss. Any doubt that may have existed in that respect is completely dispelled by this proposal, which callously ignores the rights of wives and children. Of what use is it to endeavour to patch up a working man in order that he might continue in employment, if we ignore entirely the health of his children, who later will take his place in- &#39;industry? Must one continue to repeat the unpleasant facts which our vital statistics reveal in this respect? Does not the Government realize that the worker&#39;s children of to-day will be the wageearners of to-morrow, and that if every provision is not made to protect their health right from birth, a third of our future children, as vital statistics indicate, will be physically sub-normal and mentally deficient ? That is not my statement, but the considered view of officers of the Health Departments of. New South Wales and theCommonwealth. Yet this so-called national health insurance measure makes noprovision whatever for the protection- of the health of Australian mothers by extending to them the medical benefits provided under this bill. If the Government wishes to make any pretence of establishing a national health scheme, it should start with the infant in the cradle, or the mother in her pre-natal period; at that stage more than at any other can we safeguard the health of our people. Judging by this measure, however, industry is not concerned with either the infant or the mother, because neither of them earn a wage from which contributions towards this fund can be made. Because employers and vested interests wish to pay as little as possible towards the financing of this scheme, the Government is not concerned with the claims of wives and children to participate in it. The Government may describe this as a national health scheme, but history will call it something else. Practically every honorable member is the father of a family, and he knows from experience what family life means. He is aware of the risks involved in motherhood. But this Government declares, in effect, that it does not care &#34; a tinker&#39;s cuss &#34; about the mothers of the nation. It has gone so far, however, as to bring experts from overseas to advise it as to the least expensive method of patching up the carcass of a man who works alongside a machine in order that he may be enabled to continue to eke out profits for his employer. This measure is the worst example of cold-blooded brutality  which this Parliament has ever been asked to perpetrate; for sheer base commercialism..! have not encountered anything like it during my parliamentary career, and such brutal disregard of the rights of mothers and children will go down in history, not only as a discredit to this Government and every one who supports it, -but also as evidence of the degradation of this Parliament. </para>

          <para>.- The refusal of the Ministry to take cognizance of the views expressed on the secondreading debate with regard to insuring that in this bill provision shall be made for medical services for wives and children makes it imperative that, on this clause dealing with medical benefit, the Opposition shall now make its final stand in respect of this all-important question. Talcing what is contained in the bill with the somewhat vague and nebulous statements which have been made concerning what may be included in another measure, we are .forced to the conclusion that the Government proposes that there shall be compulsory insurance for the medical treatment of the husband whilst the husband shall have the option further to make provision for the medical treatment of his wife and children. He has had that option hitherto, because friendly societies have given to the wage-earners of Australia the opportunity to make payments to cover medical benefits for their wives and children. &#39; One argument which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> used in justification of the compulsory insurance of the men was the fact that only 400,000 wage-earners in Australia were members of friendly societies, the total number of persons embraced by friendly societies being approximately <inline font-style="italic">700,000.</inline> Every one of those 400,000 members can be regarded as wage-earners, who have either felt the need to make this prudent arrangement for the medical treatment of their wives, or have felt that their income was such as to enable .them to make such provision. The Government, however, says, in effect, that this is a plan solely for medical benefits for employees, and it is compulsory for the husband to insure himself for medical &#39;treatment. By its disregard of the principle of compulsion in respect of medical treatment for wives  and children, however, the  Government jeopardizes the whole proposal in respect of national health. An optional system does two things. First of all, it leaves the wife, as a citizen of the State, absolutely dependent upon what provision her husband makes for her, although her husband, as a citizen of the State, does have to make compulsory provision for his own medical treatment. I could understand that, in respect of a system of purely contributory insurance, the Government should say that it shall be compulsory for every employee to make full provision for medical treatment for himself, hut not for his wife and f amily. That, of course, would be a plan in which the community, as a community, would not be taxed in order to subvent it, and, therefore, the husband as an employee would not be drawing upon the taxpayers in any respect in order that he might have a better health provision for himself than would otherwise be possible. But this scheme distinguishes between the citizenship rights of the wife and the citizenship rights of the husband, in that the Consolidated Revenue of this nation is to be drawn upon to provide a fund out of which medical treatment will be made available to the husband but not to his wife. That is my. first point. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>My second point is that in so far as the husband will have the option of making voluntary provision for the medical treatment of his wife, that option will be more apparent than real, because it has to be measured in relation to the resources of the husband. Already, the husband will be taxed ls. 6d. a week in order to make provision for his own insurance. Then he will be called upon to make an additional contribution should he desire to place his wife and children on an equal basis with himself in respect of medical treatment. Such a proposal calls to mind the remark of Anatole France : &#34; The rich, of course, are never accused of stealing bread because they are never under any necessity to steal bread; only the poor are convicted of such offences &#34;. The man who is in receipt of from 10s. to &#163;1 above the basic wage is warranted in making voluntary provision for the protection of his wife and family. I recommend all men who can afford to do so to make such provision for their wives and families, and I offer such advice not only in their own interests, but also because it is proper for them so to do. This scheme, however, has been born of the urge of the Government to give a national health service, by an averaging of the risks involved. But it violates the whole principle of averaging by excluding wives and children. It is a negation of the principle of national health insurance to say to a man on the basic wage : &#34; On your wage you will probably not be able to make a contribution,&#34; and to a man in receipt of a margin above the basic wage: &#34; You ought to make a contribution &#34;. The contention that this is a plan primarily intended to keep the worker fit in order that he may continue in production for the profit of his employer appears to be justified, when we find that it is the husband who is to be kept fit, whilst his wife, who has to stay at home and cook for him and care for bis children as an unpaid domestic - the sharer of all his risks and difficulties - is excluded from protection under this measure. The Opposition will not accept the assurance of the Government that, in another bill to be produced in the near or distant future, special provision will be made for the insurance of wives. As this is a scheme in respect of which the taxpayers in general, and employers and employees as classes, are to be called upon to make contributions, we say that this anti-feminist Government ought to be permitted no longer to exclude the wives of working men from the legal guarantees given to their husbands. &#34;Wives are, at any rate, the equals of their husbands in the economic service they render to the country, for I reject the stupid argument that the husband alone earns the income. In the subdivision of labour, by which she does all the work in the home - cooking, washing, nursing and all the incidence of housewifery - the wife is a contributor to her husband&#39;s earning ability. It is monstrous, therefore, that the income of the husband should be drawn upon, under the law, to ensure for him a service which is not to be made available to his wife. Every penny of the tax, which the worker would compulsorily pay under this scheme, would reduce the funds available to his wife for the upkeep of the home, and to that extent she would be deprived of means whereby she might make alternative provision. Any payment which reduced the husband&#39;s wages would curtail his wife&#39;s resources, and anything legally taken from the husband&#39;s wage should be only for benefits which the wife is statutorily assured of being able to enjoy equally with her husband. </para>

          <para>. - The argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> in favour of the inclusion of wives and children as beneficiaries under the insurance scheme does not seem to be in accord with statements made by him in his second-reading speech. On that occasion he said that the cost of the medical treatment of sufferers from occupational diseases and vocational sickness could be properly regarded as a charge on industry to which the employer might be expected to contribute, but he suggested, if ihe did not actually make the statement, that the cost of the medical treatment of an employee affected with illness which could not be ascribed to the occupation which he followed, could not be fairly regarded as the responsibility of this employer. </para>

Now, however, he goes out of  hi3  way to argue that, in a scheme which in its very essence is framed on a contributory basis, the employer subsidizing the payments to be made by the employee, the employer should help to defray the cost of the medical treatment of, not only an insured person suffering from an occupational disease, but also his wife and children. . </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition, who is usually very consistent, that the argument which he is now advancing is diametrically opposed to that used by him in his second-reading speech. The friendly societies, which have rendered a great service to Australia, have, I understand, made strong representations that  they should be left some part of this field undisturbed in which to carry on their work. The Government, in enabling them to do this, is determined to assist in the provision of medical treatment of the dependants of the employee who is the subject of the honorable gentleman&#39;s indignation. The Government proposes to assist them, by a subsidy on a family basis, to reduce the contributions that the wage-earner would have to make to such bodies in order to have his wife and children covered for medical benefit. That seems to be an admirable and practicable method of overcoming the difficulty. The Treasurer gave an undertaking, on behalf of the Government, that a subsidy of some kind would be made to the friendly societies to enable them to reduce their charges to the wageearner, so that the two contributions he will be required to make will not total a greater amount than he can afford. </para>

          <para>. - I cannot follow the reasoning of the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> It is ridiculous for him to suggest, at this stage, that there is anything inconsistent in the arguments used by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> whose first objection to this bill was that it failed to provide medical benefit for the wives and children of compulsorily insured persons. It was pointed out that this measure would undermine the stability of friendly societies, without bridging the gap which it would create. It was said that the real reason why workers join these societies is, generally, to provide medical treatment, not for themselves, but for their wives and children. The records of the societies show that most members join on the eve of their marriage, or shortly afterwards. The honorable member for Gippsland selected a statement by the Leader of the Opposition that the employer&#39;s share of the contribution should be sufficient only to meet the risks in respect of his own employee, and not the family of the employee; but the Leader of the Opposition knew that, as the contributions were to be made by three parties, and would  not wholly come out of the Consolidated Revenue, the scheme could not fairly be described as a national one. It does not cover everybody in the commu nity, and all are not required to contribute towards the cost of the scheme. Probably 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, of the people whom I represent would be forced to become contributors under this scheme, and the great mass of them, I am sure, are already members of friendly societies. The average worker has some security for himself under the state laws relating to workers&#39; compensation, and his real reason for joining a friendly society is, as I have already suggested, his desire to protect his wife and children. I protest against this measure, because it excludes the wives and children of insured persons from medical benefit. A hotch-potch scheme such as this should not be described, as a national one. 1 protest, on behalf of my electors, against their being compelled to contribute ls. 6d. a week under this scheme, although it will still be necessary for them to retain their membership of a friendly society in order to provide medical benefits for  their  wives and children. At least 80 per cent, of the workers whom I represent would not be provided for under this bill as well as they now are by the friendly societies, and, therefore, I object to tb&#171; measure being bludgeoned through this Parliament. </para>

          <para>. - I stated in my second-reading speech that, in my opinion, the person responsible for the drafting of this bill either came from the ranks of the wealthy class, or was not a family man. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that a citizen&#39;s first responsibility! is to his wife and children. The average worker joins a friendly society, not to protect himself so much as to provide medical benefits for his wife and children. The utmost consideration should always be shown for the mothers of families, because the nation owes them a great debt. During an epidemic of a disease such as whooping cough, the children suffer more than the adults. The fact of there being thousands of children in our hospitals suffering from infantile paralysis should have been sufficient to convince the Government that children should be included in this scheme. Honorable members opposite are neither logical nor consistent in their treatment of women and children. I regard it as my first duty to preserve the health of my wife and children, and every decent man holds similar views. It is all very well for honorable members opposite, many of whom have private incomes in addition to their parliamentary allowance, to jibe at honorable members on &#34;this side who advocate the claims of the women and children. There are some who claim that the farmers are the backbone of the nation, but I maintain that the mothers, who bring into the world our future citizens, are the nation&#39;s greatest assets. Any man who has in him a spark of manhood will protect the mothers of the nation; yet honorable members opposite laugh when their claims are advocated. A man who is not prepared to fight for the women of the nation is not worthy of his mother or his wife. Although, as the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said, the mothers are the reservoir from which the nation draws its manhood, this bill makes no provision for them. It is true that the Treasurer has promised to introduce other legislation later to deal with them, but, unfortunately, his promises cannot be accepted. I do not accept the statement that, following a meeting of caucus, the Government is prepared to rectify its neglect to the women and children of the workers. If this is to be in reality a national health and insurance scheme, it must include the whole of the people. Nothing is of greater importance to a nation than a high average standard of health, and, therefore, the care of the children should be our first concern. Even from an economic point of view, that is necessary, for, otherwise, a strong virile nation, cannot be. developed. Growing children require constant care. &#34;We all know the serious effects of illness and neglect. Honorable members opposite talk glibly in praise of the women in outback districts, but this bill will not do anything to make their lot happier. There is no inconsistency on &#39; this side of the House, but honorable members opposite who have criticized this measure have allowed the steam-roller to be put over them to-day. </para>

A somewhat similar proposal was put forward by the Opposition during the second-reading stage. The Opposition regards the health of the women and children of the community as of such importance to the nation that it is not prepared to vote upon this clause without making a determined effort to secure medical benefits for them. It is the duty of the nation to protect and preserve the health of its growing citizens. As I pointed out in my secondreading speech, there is a good deal of talk about the value of physical training of youth, but no system of physical training can be successful if the health of the children has been neglected in their early years. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> said that industry should not be called upon to provide for the women and children of the community. </para>

            <para>- Unless industry provides for the wives and children of the workers, for what purpose does it exist? Although .the mother of the family works in the home, she serves industry there just as effectively as if she were employed in the workshop. Therefore, any bill which purports to deal with the health of the nation, must provide for the family of the worker as well as for the worker himself. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, half of the income of the husband is considered to be the income of the wife; a woman is not entitled to a pension if her husband&#39;s earnings are beyond a. certain amount. That is because half of the earnings of the husband arc considered to belong to ber. Any payment which a worker makes under this legislation ought to provide for medical services for bis wife and children, as well as for himself. I hope that the Government will agree to the postponement of this clause, with a view to making better provision for the wives and families of the workers. The Treasurer said that it is impossible to make that provision here. I should like to know his reasons. The production of this country is so great that ample provision should be made for all its citizens. The preservation of the health of the nation should be a charge on Consolidated Revenue. It is useless to talk of maternal and infant welfare unless we are prepared to do something under this bill for the health of the mothers and children in the community. I hope, therefore, that the Treasurer will agree to postpone the clause with a view to providing for medical services to the wives and children of insured persons, as well as to the insured, persons themselves. </para>

          <para>.- The motion that the clause be postponed is both simple and reasonable. The motive underlying it is worthy. The precise meaning of the proposal to postpone the clause was laid down in a revised form Inst night by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey).</inline> The honorable gentleman is opposed to the postponement because he is not prepared to accept the principle of an amendment which was ruled out of order. Last night he inverted that erroneous view of what was involved in a postponement, when the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory)</inline> moved an amendment which was ruled out of order. It was found that a considerable measure of support was forthcoming for that amendment, but as it was ruled out of order, the honorable gentleman moved for the postponement of the clause. Only after he had made a careful count of heads did the Treasurer admit that it was desirable to give a more restricted meaning to the word &#34; postponement &#34; and he thereupon agreed to postpone the clause. In the light of those facts, which are indisputable, I suggest that this clause might very well be postponed until the fate of the motion by the honorable member for </para>

        <para class="block">Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson)</inline> has been determined. When we consider the list of benefits provided in this bill - medical, sickness, disablement, pensions and additional benefits, widows&#39; and orphans&#39; pensions, and allowances for dependent children - it is evident that the underlying reason for this bill is that the burden of pensions payments shall be transferred from the taxpayers of this country to the workers, and that pensioners shall pay for their own pensions. In other words, the pressure on wealth is to be removed by the representatives of wealth. Those who profit by the capitalist system are to take drastic measures to unburden themselves of a responsibility which they think that they have borne too long. That proposition is ratified and proven up to the hilt by an examination of this clause, because, when we turn away from the pensions aspect, which is easily understood, and examine other  aspects, such as sickness benefit, for instance, with which we are particularly concerned, we find that the Government is not interested in the maintenance and integrity of family life at all. The worker will receive in benefit only part of the money which he has himself compulsorily contributed. When we turn to the schedule and examine the insignificant amount of the orphan&#39;s pension, and the precarious conditions under which that benefit can be enjoyed, we realize that the majority of orphans will be cheated of the pension, by reason of the fact that under the vicious social system that prevails, their parents have been thrown out of work and have been unable to maintain the weekly payments which condition all benefits under the bill. </para>
        <para>An amazing development has occurred in regard to the medical benefits. An announcement was made to-day, in answer to a carefully but not very artistically arranged question, that a royal commission was about to inquire into payments to the medical practitioners for services rendered. The remuneration of the medical practitioner is entirely in the air, and as the rewards of the medical practitioner remain uncertain and cannot be determined for another six or twelve months it follows that the nature and extent of medical benefits must also, in the meantime, remain in the air. Just as the committee was asked last night to discuss details of contributions before it had determined that contributions should be levied, so the committee to-night is asked to discuss the incidence of medical benefits when the major question of medical benefits has been remitted to a royal commission which may not furnish its report for another twelve months, if ever. </para>
        <para>I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> that you must be impressed by the utter futility of proceding with the consideration of this bill under conditions which oppress honorable members.

Amendments proposed to be moved from this side of the committee will be incontinently rejected, without even being put to a division. Our honorable friends opposite will thus be saved from the embarrassment which otherwise would have oppressed them, of voting against proposals coming from this side of which, according to their speeches on the secondreading, they, nevertheless, heartily approve. In the circumstances I am very glad to note the increasing volume of evidence that the bill becomes more unpopular every day. The better it is understood, the more certain it becomes that ultimately it must be frustrated. I said last night that the bill was doomed. The honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> is right when he says that knowing that the bill is doomed, and knowing that it has to save its face in difficult circumstances, the Government is determined by force of numbers and by extreme and unjust exercise of the Standing Orders, to force this bill through the chamber and to force it through Parliament before opportunity can be given for it to be considered in the Senate by the recently-elected representatives of the people. </para>

        <para class="block">It has become increasingly evident, as the discussion of the measure has proceeded, that subscribers will be in grave danger of being placed on medical panels which will be far too large to enable practitioners to give even reasonable service. Neglect is likely to be the experience of many subscribers, not only in respect of general medical treatment, but also, and particularly, in respect of specialist treatment in connexion with industrial diseases and other disorders which may be held to bc outside the range of general practitioners. We have been told frequently during the last week or two that the British act has worked satisfactorily, but information available to us from other than Government sources is to the contrary effect. The Secretary of the Trade Union Congress of Great Britain, who has had a long experience of the operation of the British act, commented on the work of the general practitioner service in Great Britain as follows - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline>(Kinnear) recommends for Australia the same kind of medical benefit as we have here, namely, a general practitioner service as set out in paragraph 34 of his report. Our criticism of that service is that it is not by any means complete. The practitioner has no link with consultants or specialists of any kind and the range of services that he can give is strictly limited. This again is, in our opinion, a very serious drawback 5n the medical benefit, and although a royal commission as far back as 1925 recommended the provision of a consultant and specialist service, it has not yet been done. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Those observations indicate considerable dissatisfaction with the British law, yet the Government is offering us an inferior service. Moreover, as far back as 1925, a royal commission in Great Britain emphatically recommended that provision should be made for consultant and specialist services in addition to the existing, general practitioner service. The provisions of this bill therefore are at least thirteen years behind the most advanced thought in Great Britain on this subject. The rosy complexion which the Treasurer has sought to paint on the face of the British scheme will not bear examination. </para>
        <para>Not only has that scheme been adversely criticized by the Secretary of the Trade Union Congress of Great Britain, but even medical practitioners working under it have condemned it as unsatisfactory. I direct attention to the following observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Harrie</inline> Roberts which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">New Statesman and Nation</inline> of June, 1935: - </para>
        <para>But thu medical treatment officially provided for the wage earners of this country takes little account of the enormous development in practical therapeutics during the last 25 years. Commonly, the treatment means little more than that every insured person can have a bottle of medicine when he wants it and takes the trouble to ask for it. When the insurance act was introduced, the bottle of medicine was just about to settle down on its death-bed. The act rejuvenated it and to-day there can hardly bc a working class home in thu land without a- partly consumed or 10 oz. bottle of bitter or sweet, brown or pinkish, mixture composed of ingredient&#39;s in the efficacy of most of which, not  one  doctor in 50 has thu slightest faith. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roberts</inline>had an extensive practice as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> panel doctor in Great Britain for many years, and he described the British general practitioner service as a &#34; bottleof.medicineservice &#34;. He also wrote in the most disparaging way of the efficacy of the medicines prescribed. Yet the Treasurer, in spite of his statement that &#34;it is no longer a question of &#39; the pouring of medicine, of which we know little, into bodies of which we know less&#39;&#34;, is advocating that we should adopt something even less satisfactory than the British service. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roberts</inline> also remarked - </para>
        <para>No  provision is made for a serious surgical treatment beyond such as is considered within the competence and skill of the average general practitioner - and thu medical organization has&#39; striven hard to keep that official standard as low as possible. The panel medi- i-al system should either bo scrapped or radically modified. </para>
        <para class="block">If is regrettable that in these circumstances the Government should even  sug-gest  a service less comprehensive than that provided in Great Britain as long ago as 1925 when the royal commission recommended extended benefits. Here we have a medical practitioner, with an extensive practice under the British act, advocating that the panel medical system should be either scrapped or radically modified. He further advocates that it - should he so organically linked with specialist  institutions as  to place within the reach of all who need  them,  in proportion to their need, all the medical knowledge and surgical skill available and should be free from the mass of useless rules. </para>
        <para class="block">Obviously, we want to avoid useless rules. I am moving for the postponement of the clause because I believe that the contributors to this scheme should have available to them not only the ordinary general practitioner service, but also, in case of necessity - which is ever growing because of the development of industrial diseases - such specialist care as is required. It may be argued by those who are opposed to the inclusion of this benefit that the money to finance it cannot be found. I am positive that the Treasurer has very greatly under-estimated the number of persons to be brought under this scheme. I believe also that he has considerably exaggerated the expenditure it involves. I am inclined to the view expressed by the honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> who, in an exhaustive examination of probable income and expenditure, showed&#39; that an enormous surplus will be available after all needs have been met. The provision of specialist treatment would not involve such a heavy financial obligation that the funds available would not be sufficient to meet the requirements. </para>
        <para>My amendment also covers the provision of medical services in maternity cases. Under the bill as drafted, an expectant mother was to be precluded from obtaining either medical or sickness benefit for two weeks prior and one month subsequent to the birth of her child. The present intention of the Government is to delete that clause and to make available a sickness &#34; benefit to an expectant mother. I suggest this further amendment, of this clause to enable medical services to be provided. Anticipating the argument that this service is already provided for expectant mothers under the provisions of the Maternity Allowance Act, I point out that in 1936, the maternity allowance was granted in respect of only 79,254 cases out of a total of 116,000 births in Australia, the expenditure being &#163;370,000. The allowance is given only in the most necessitous cases, and the amount of maternity allowance in individual cases falls far short of the financial requirements associated with such situations. In any event, as only those mothers who,  being workers in industry and therefore contributors to this scheme, will be affected, I venture to affirm that not more than &#163;30,000 or &#163;40,000 per annum would be needed to provide medical attention to contributors in maternity cases. This attention is very necessary, &#34; because the rate of maternal mortality in Australia in 1930 was 5.30 a thousand. In only seven countries was the rate higher ; they were, Belgium, Northern Ireland, Greece, South Africa, Scotland and Egypt. From a national viewpoint, if only a proportion of the lives of mothers who die in childbirth were preserved, the expenditure of &#163;30,000 per annum would be well justified. These mothers who have to work in order to maintain a family, and thereby become subscribers to this scheme, are the poorest section o&#34; the female workers of Australia, because only absolute economic necessity drives them into employment, and in the vast majority of cases maternal mortality is caused by lack of proper attention at childbirth. </para>

          <para>. - An examination of clause 47 seems to me to indicate that it excludes many things the inclusion of which is eminently desirable. Therefore, the speech of my colleague, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> 1 believe, merits the consideration of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey).</inline> I understood that when this project was embarked upon, the idea was to endeavour to evolve a scheme which would be of substantial benefit. Apparently, however, the Government lias adopted a very rigid view as to what should be the benefits. It may consider that in the benefits proposed the maximum value, actuarially considered, is being given for the contributions that are to be made. A comparison with other schemes, however, shows how feeble are its efforts. I suggest that when it is considering the introduction of further measures, it ought to study the proposals of the neighbouring dominion of New Zealand. For example, clause 47 specifically excludes medical services involving the exercise of such special skill or experience as general medical practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess, or treatment or attendance in respect of a confinement or such other medical services as are prescribed. The New Zealand proposals include hospital treatment, sanatorium treatment, maternity treatment, anaesthetic treatment, laboratory and radiology - specialist and consultant - massage and physiotherapy. Prospective benefits are home nursing and domestic assistance. This illustrates the difference between the outlook of a democratic Labour government and&#39; that of a government which has no real consideration for the interests of the mass of the people. I regret that it is necessary to say that, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> realize the unpleasantness of having continually to condemn the Government when endeavouring to make the best of the measure and do some constructive -work. However, we are not being allowed sufficient time to make proper comparisons which would show how very inadequate are these efforts to provide benefits for the people. Under die New Zealand scheme, a man on a basic wage of &#163;4 16s. would contribute about 4s. 9d. a week, but in return he would receive every benefit. In Australia, a married man with a family wil have to pay approximately 4s. 3d. a week. In the first place, he will pay ls. 6d. a week on his own behalf. Then, if he makes provision for his wife and family through a. lodge, he will be involved in an average charge of ls. 3d. a week. If, in addition, he wishes to provide a pension for his wife, he will have to pay ls. a week for a pension of 15s., and ls. 6d. a week for a pension of &#163;1. I deeply regret that the instructions given by the Government to its experts were of such a nature that the scheme brought down is at least thirteen years behind the limes when compared with what has been done in Great Britain. Surely we had a right to expect something up-to-date and all-embracing! Modern scientific treatment is available to those who can afford it, yet under this scheme, the greatest proportion of the cost of which will be borne by the workers, no provision is made for those matters which are absolutely essential to its success. There are many other references that I should like to make, and I strongly resent the limitation of the debate because it has prevented my constituency of 65,000 electors from having its views adequately represented on a number of clauses. The Government is afraid of criticism of this measure, which does not do justice to the people, notwithstanding the expenditure involved in it. </para>

I covered a good deal of the ground in my second-reading speech, and wish now merely to emphasize the fact that the clause very definitely excludes certain necessary benefits. I have spoken to the Treasurer regarding the voluntary insurance scheme that is in operation in the industry in which I worked prior to entering this Parliament. That scheme includes the services of specialists. It is a pity that the experts who were brought from the Old Country were not conversant with its provisions, particularly as occupational diseases play such havoc in the mining industry. There is, for instance, an occupational disease known as nystagmus. </para>

          <para>- In many instances it is not. Many miners have given up work underground in order to recover from that affliction. They already receive the benefit of treatment by an eye specialist and free glasses, by reason of their contributions to a voluntary scheme. Under this bill specialist treatment of that kind will not be provided as a medical benefit. How can the Government expect harmony in an industry such as coal-mining, when it introduces a measure such as this which does not provides an opportunity for workers to secure specialist treatment beyond what could be reasonably expected of their own general practitioner? This clause further denies an expectant mother the benefit of specialist treatment during the critical period of her confinement. I cannot understand why the Government&#39;s expert advisers should have denied this benefit to women, especially in a country which boasts of the liberality of its social services. This is merely going back to the nigger stage of our development. It is high time that wesought the advice of our own experts rather than that of experts from overseas who know little or nothing about the condition of affairs in this country. These overseas experts during the consideration of this bill, have sat in this chamber grinning like Cheshire cats when honorable members on this side have endeavoured to improve the provisions of the bill. I tell them that they know nothing. 1 understand that they are to go tothe United States of America shortly. If they want to gain first-hand knowledge of what can be done to provide insurance for workers, they should first visit my constituency and examine the voluntary schemes in operation in the coal-mining areas. </para>

            <para>- It is monstrous to think that those persons engaged in  the  coal-mining industry will be precluded from receiving benefits under the national insurance scheme to which they are already entitled under their own voluntary schemes. The benefits contemplated by the bill do not nearly approach those to which the members of the organization to which I belonged are already entitled under voluntary schemes which have been in operation since before I was born. I have been invited by the mines management committee at Newcastle to explain this half-baked measure. I have replied that, because of the number of amendments that have been made or will be made to the bill, nobody could explain it. <inline font-style="italic">So</inline> altered is the bill from its original form, that Casey, Kinnear and company do not now know the child they conceived. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion a woman should be entitled to special attention for a month before, and two months after, her confinement. The mothers of Australia are rendering to the nation the greatest .possible service within their power. I enter my emphatic protest against the failure of the Government to provide in this bill the fullest benefits for mothers, particularly during their confinement. All this clause sets out to do is to repair the injuries sustained by workers in industry. In contrast to the restricted benefits proposed under this bill, let me recite the benefits to which contributors to the voluntary scheme in my electorate are entitled: Provision is made for hospital treatment for a contributor and his family while he or they are in hospital. Further, in the event of the contributor&#39;s death, provision is made for the payment of funeral benefits of &#163;50 from the general organization and &#163;50 from the local miners&#39; lodge. In the event of the death of the wife of a contributor a funeral benefit of &#163;30 is paid, and &#39;benefits are provided in respect of the death of children ranging down to &#163;2 for a* child dying in its first year. In addition, provision is made for treatment by an eye specialist and free glasses for the contributor, his wife and family. This bill has been referred to as a great national insurance scheme; it is the rottenest piece of legislation that has ever been placed before the people of this country. It should be sent back to those responsible for it. So far as I am personally concerned, I would have nothing to do with it ; I  would  not try to amend it because it is not worth amending. The party to which I belong has endeavoured to amend it, in order to make it more acceptable to the people, but because of rotten party political considerations, the Government will not accept any suggestions that emanate from this side of the chamber. &#34;With the assistance of its adherents, it hopes to gag the measure through this chamber, but I doubt if it will succeed. I trust that even at this eleventh hour the Government will agree to the postponement of this clause. </para>

        <para>The amendment I have in mind could be embodied in clause 47. Of all the areas with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear is highly competent to deal, the coal-fields areas must be the most understood by him. Therefore, I deplore the remarks of the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James).</inline> I . feel sure that he did not realize the meaning of the words he used when he made such uncomplimentary references to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear, who, in my opinion, should be eminently competent to give valuable information to the Government, certainly in respect of the coal-mining districts. I rise to speak of the isolated areas in respect of which I would not expect him to have exact knowledge because they possess problems of a peculiar and remote kind. I propose to deal with those areas where the services of specialists are not available and where specialists would have to undertake a journey of about 2,000 miles to visit their patients. I point out, however, that the Northern  Territory  has a great number of people who are competent to give ordinary medical services in remote areas pending the arrival of a qualified medical practitioner. I speak particularly in regard to the special circumstances of the Northern territory and other inland areas contiguous to the Territory. As honorable members know, we have few doctors, but scattered through our pioneering community we have a number of splendid women who came to us as nurses of the Australian Inland Mission, and who have since married and become citizens of the Northern Territory. <inline font-style="italic">We</inline> have others, including members and wives of members of the police force, who can carry out all the ordinary simple medical duties until ii qualified doctor arrives to take charge of the patient. Most of these people are the first resource of the sick and injured in the Northern Territory, and I think I can say that they all act without any thought of gain, and that many of them would consider it a bitter insult if it were thought that they sought to gain by their freely given services. At the same time, however, in view of the principles which are being established under this bill, their services, in my opnion, should bc recognized. Such recognition would at least give them a status; it would make known that they at least exist, and the public would be informed as to where their services are available. Some of them may be prepared to take payment, and I can assure honorable members that they would thoroughly deserve it. Others may feel that their circumstances are such that they do not need payment. The Government should concede to them the right to collect fees if they so desire. However, I do not stress that point. Some of them might like to hand the money to that magnificent organization, the Australian Inland Mission, which, conceived and managed by the Presbyterian Church, knows neither colour, creed, nor class when medical* services arc demanded of it. Others might like to establish local medical services with their earnings, but in any case the offer should be made as a tribute to the self-sacrificing services of this gallant outback band of women and mon, who, unlike many city doctors, cannot keep rich homes in the suburbs and still have a surplus left to buy yachts. These people of the outback are willing to give their time and labour to save valuable lives, to steer new popu lation into Australia, and to prevent suffering in the Never-Never. I would emphasize that the whole of the people of the outback are interested in this subject of medical services. Some of them may be temporarily annoyed with me for raising the question at all, but I am not going to allow the bill to pass without doing what I consider to be ordinary common justice to them. There is nothing new in principle in the alteration I suggest. In &#39;the New Guinea mandate there is provision for medical assistance by &#34;lik lik doctors &#34;, which is pidgin English for &#34; little doctors &#34;, many of whom arc far less qualified than the retired nurses of the Australian Inland Mission, policemen&#39;s wives, and others who give their services in the Northern Territory. I am merely asking the House to extend to the people of the Northern Territory what is already a recognized type of service provided for natives and others in New Guinea. The least tribute that Parliament can pay to the outback medical workers is to recognize them in the bill. 1. can assure you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that in my country these people are far more honoured than any city doctor who, in his own sphere, reaps a. rich harvest from illness and suffering, and maintains a palatial home in the suburbs. So that honorable members may have an opportunity to discuss the later clauses of the bill, I merely ask that those persons who are qualified in the outback to render assistance before a medical practitioner arrives should be given a status. The bill should recognize them and allow payment for their services, and their stations should be listed so that the people of the territory may know where medical services are obtainable. </para>

        <para class="block">I could continue to quote at very great length in the same strain. The honorable member made a very well-reasoned appeal to the committee for the broadening of the general practitioner service to something that would take in all the specialized services. He desired that an insured member of the community should have at his disposal specialists in dentistry, specialists in the care of the ears and eyes, and specialists in many other branches of medicine. I think that no person with red blood in his veins can demur to that ideal. It is a high and reasonable ideal, and I hope that one of these days we shall be able to give effect to it- Just now, however, we are only starting in this business of national insurance, and we are giving a general practitioner service in the first place. Out of the surpluses of the approved societies in the future we aim to extend the benefits set out in the bill, but I hope that even that will not be the end. As we gain experience, we should be able to improve generally, and particularly the medical services. At this moment, however, with all the goodwill in the world, and even if we had had the necessary experience, it would not be possible to launch such a scheme throughout Australia, because we have not the necessary number of specialists spread throughout the continent. Such a service is a matter for the future, but I hope that we shall be able to achieve it before very long. </para>
        <para>In reply to the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James),</inline> I would inform him that the Government takes full responsibility for the bill, and for everything in it.

I ask him not to direct any unpleasant remarks at the two English officers who are sitting in the officials&#39; compartment in this chamber, and who are unable, because of the forms of the House, to reply to him.  His  action is an unsporting thing to do. Let the critics of the bill direct their shafts against me or against the .Government, but not against men whose mouths are sealed because they are the advisers of the Government. </para>

          <para>.- I regret that in respect of the benefits to be provided under this bill the Government is lagging behind other countries. It is now over&#39; thirteen years since a royal commission, inquired into proposals for national insurance in Australia. I was a member of that commission, but there were only two other Labour members besides myself. The  chairman  was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> of Tasmania, and there were several other members holding political convictions different from ours. It could not be expected, therefore, that the commission would make any very radical recommendations, but its suggestions, were, in many respects, much ahead of the proposals in the present scheme. For instance, it was recommended that a maternity benefit of 20s. a week should be payable for two weeks before the birth of a child, and for four weeks afterwards. There is no provision at all in this scheme for pre-natal or post-natal benefits. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but the scheme does not provide for pre-natal and post-natal benefit as such. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the  chairman  of the royal commission, was a&#34; very keen advocate of maternal welfare, a matter which is now receiving close attention throughout the world. Efforts are being made in Australia at the present time to reduce maternal mortality to the minimum. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> and the other members of the royal commission, signed the recommendations in common with the rest of us. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> in his speech this evening, referred to the vastly superior national insurance proposals that had been put forward in New Zealand.I do not propose to go over the same ground, and touch upon the matter merely in order to show that the Government is definitely lagging behind in regard to these matters, instead of bringing forward a scheme which is abreast of the times. The decline of the birth-rate in Australia is such that within 29 years our population will be stationary. Every one must admit that that is a serious condition of affairs for a&#39; country which is capable of carrying a population of 45,000,000. No matter how our people may work and strive to make this a great country, everything we have accomplished must inevitably be lost if this population decline is not stopped. We have tried to build up our population by immigration, and not only have we failed to do so, but we have been unable to hold even those Britishers who did come here from overseas. It is admitted that immigration is necessary, particularly from northern Europe and from Great Britain itself, yet the fact remains that, during the last few years, 7,000 more people returned to Great Britain from Australia than came here from Great Britain. Despite the expenditure of large sums of money to induce immigrants to come here, we have been unable to keep them because social conditions are not attractive. One reason is the lack of a national insurance scheme of the kind to which English people are accustomed. No doubt the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will say that the scheme now before us is equal to that of Great Britain, but apart from the welfare of our own people which is, of course, our first consideration, we should have something better if we are to attract and keep immigrants. This is a country worth staying in, and we should endeavour to make conditions so attractive that people will come here and remain. </para>

        <para>A step in this direction would be the making of a more substantial Commonwealth grant for the maintenance of aerial medical services in the outback areas. At the present time, a small Commonwealth grant is made towards the cost of this work, and with its help medical services are maintained at several centres from which they cover practically the whole of the north-western part of Western Australia. From Wyndham  twice a day wireless medical sessions are conducted so that people in the outback, and particularly women in need of advice, may keep in constant touch with the doctor in Wyndham by means of pedal wireless sets. If a larger grant were available this work could be extended. </para>

          <para>.- Can the Treasurer say what will be done to provide medical services for people living in the remote parts of Australia, such as those north-western towns of Queensland which are 150 miles and more away from the nearest doctor? The Sta te government has realized the difficulties confronting these people, and proposes to establish at Cloncurry a service similar to that provided by the Australian Inland Mission. A base hospital has been established at that centre, and two flying doctors will operate from there, covering an area of 300 miles in all directions. I should like to know, however, what provision is to be made for providing medical service under this scheme until the State scheme is in operation, and in areas which the State scheme will not touch. </para>

          <para>. - The Government proposes to give flexible powers to the commission to deal with outback areas. If it is impossible, in the early stages, to provide medical assistance, the contributions will be diminished, or there will be a refund of an appropriate amount. The Government hopes that the number of areas in which adequate medical treatment is not now available will be relatively few, and that the number will eventually decrease. The Government will, through the commission, endeavour to get medical men to settle in those areas where at present the service is inadequate, and will also make some financial provision where the services are now lacking. One of the indirect benefits of the measure will be a- distinct and progressive improvement of the medical and pharmaceutical services at present available in the more remote parts of Australia. It is not practicable to say what will be done in any particular area, but the commission will have definite directions to fill the gaps such as those mentioned by the honorable member for Kennedy. No doubt the attention of the commission will be directed to that part of the continent referred to by the honorable member. </para>

        <para class="block">I can understand why such services as are mentioned are excluded under this scheme. Provision has already been made for the payment of a maternity allowance in certain cases, and I believe that the Government considers that that allowance adequately covers all those cases that should be met out of governmental subvention. The Treasurer informed the committee this afternoon that the Government intends to refer the treatment of dependent women and children to the royal commission to be appointed; and I suggest that the terms of reference to the royal commission should also include the amount of subvention that will be necessary to embrace in the proposed cover for wives and dependants of insured men the ante-natal and post-natal care of mothers. In support of my contention, I direct the attention of the committee to the statements made by the ex-Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> from time to time, and also to those made by experts who at the requests of various governments have conducted inquiries in Australia in an endeavour to ascertain the cause of the high rate of maternal mortality in this country. I realize the difficulties associated with the problem, but I consider this an opportune time to bring the matter under the notice of the Government. Speaking  at the .National Health and Medical Research Council held at. Hobart from the 1st to the 3rd February of last year, the ex-Minister for Health said - </para>

          <para>But this is not the end of the story: for every woman who dies as the result of child bearing, many others are injured more or less seriously, more or less permanently. It is impossible to measure accurately this morbidity and the consequent amount of illness and suffering which women are called upon to endure. We can only guess at it from the records of gynaecological hospitals, though we know enough to be sure that in many ways this physical disability and the resulting loss of health and strength is an even more serious matter than the actual mortality. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>No provision is made in the British national insurance scheme in respect of the ante-natal and post-natal treatment of mothers, but a definite maternal rate or subvention is given to mothers because of the insurance of the breadwinner, and, where the wife is also insured, an additional payment is made; but that is insufficient. Recently, a midwifery act was passed in the British parliament under which regional clinics have been formed throughout the country in an endeavour to overtake the lag that has developed in preserving the health of the mothers and children. I suggest to the Treasurer that instead of ultimately having to introduce some new scheme to assist in preserving the health of mothers and children by governmental subvention, perhaps he may see his way clear to include in the reference to the royal commission authority to determine to what extent the ante-natal and post-natal treatment of mothers can be covered by the bill which he proposes to introduce to cover dependent wives &#39; of insured persons. We are told by all the experts who have investigated this problem that, if mothers were given the proper treatment prior to and subsequent to childbirth, the mortality and morbidity associated with this natural function would decrease to a. remarkable extent. I trust that the Treasurer will dissociate the present maternal allowance from any future proposals which may be made, and that the Government will introduce some comprehensive scheme somewhat similar to that for which provision is made in the British midwifery act. This would obviate the passage at some future date of a measure similar to that enacted in England. I ask the Treasurer to consider the advisability of including this matter in the references to the proposed royal commission. </para>

          <para>.- I understand that sub-clause 1 has caused general practitioners some concern because, under it, they will be expected to give treatment for the cure of venereal diseases, illness resulting from drunkenness, and illnesses following illegal operations or attempted illegal operations upon women.

          <para>. - This is a declaratory clause which, I think, is on the right lines, lt is just as necessary to cure diseases and disabilities of the kind mentioned by the honorable member as it is to cure other diseases. Still, this clause is &#39;governed by clause 47 which states that what we are seeking to provide is the ordinary general practitioner&#39;s service, and to the extent that these maladies are now Coped with by general practitioners we expect them to be coped with in the future. There must, however, be a dividing line somewhere, and it was proposed to draw such a line even if the Government&#39;s previous agreement with the British Medical Association had come into force. Certain points were to be set aside to be more clearly defined than is the case in the clause as drawn, and that has still to be done before the commission is set up. 1 repeat that to the extent to which a general practitioner ordinarily copes with these maladies, he will be expected to cope with them under this measure, but not to any further degree. </para>

          <para>.   -  I hope that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> will accept the suggestion made by the honorable member for &#34;Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hawker).</inline> I am inclined to move for the deletion of this clause because honorable members recognize that even under present lodge practice such diseases are excepted. For that reason the Government should agree at once to the deletion of this clause. Cases of this kind can be otherwise provided for, but, I repeat, under present lodge practices sickness benefit or any other benefit is not allowed in respect of them. I yield to no one in my sympathy for the man who gets into difficulty as the result of his own misconduct, and I am always prepared to do what I can to help him. Medical practitioners, I believe, will come to his aid, but a special fee should be charged for the treatment of such cases. Special clinics have been established in metropolitan areas for the express purpose of dealing with them. Surely when the committee knows its mind on the subject, and the Treasurer has stated that the provision in the clause will be improved, the Government will not be so hide-bound as to refuse to delete this clause immediately. The Treasurer admits the desirability of this clause being dealt with by the commission, and I point out that the medical fraternity has no fault to find on that score. The profession, however, has declared that no case of this kind will be treated as part of the ordinary service and that special arrangements should be made for their treatment. </para>

          <para>That the following further proviso be added to sub-clause (3) - &#34; Provided further that an agreement may be made with a friendly societies dispensary for the supply by it of drugs, medicines and appliances to an insured person.

        <para>I point out that friendly societies&#39; dispensaries have been established in Australia for the last 50 years. Probably because they have no counterpart in the Old Country, no provision is made in this measure in respect of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W</inline> alter Kinnear said that in all of his investigations of social activities in Australia nothing had impressed him more than the work of these dispensaries, and he expressed the view that they would be a remarkably useful unit in any form of national insurance. I do not wish to stress what honorable members already know concerning the value of the work of these dispensaries. It is a great tribute to their management that they dispense prescriptions at prices equal to the rates allowed for this purpose under the British national insurance scheme. As the cost of drugs in Australia is 33 per cent. higher than in the Old Country, this is a remarkable service. It would be a tremendous blow to friendly societies if the work of their dispensaries were ignored under this measure. As it is, the societies themselves will suffer considerably, but as one who has been associated with their activities since boyhood, I am of opinion that as approved societies they willbe able to retrieve some of their losses under this measure. As a. rule, these dispensaries are situated, in back streets because of the lower price of land, and are readily accessible to the members of friendly societies. If the dispensaries are not embraced in the scheme, the societies which have embarked on this laudable venture will be almost ruined. </para>

          <para>. -  I appreciate the argument advanced by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Green),</inline> but his amendment would make no new provision in the bill, because the Government intends to allow the friendly societies&#39; dispensaries to function under this measure. There is a slight difficulty in some of the States, particularly in Victoria, because these dispensaries are administered under State laws. I have been in communication with the Premier of Victoria, and I have asked him to agree to a certain amendment of the Friendly Societies&#39; Act that would remove this disability. As I understand the reply received from him,  he is prepared favorably to consider my proposal. I have put the executive council of the friendly societies in Victoria in touch with the Premier on this matter. </para>

A difficulty arises in regard to some of the States over the amendment submitted by the honorable member for- Kalgoorlie. In certain States, particularly New South &#34;Wales, the friendly societies&#39; dispensaries are incorporated as public companies, and so cannot be described as being conducted by friendly societies. I do not seek to make a debate point of this; I merely mention that my officers have found difficulty in arriving at a definition which would satisfactorily cover what the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has in mind. I am advised that the dispensaries in New South Wales -would not be covered by the amendment as drawn. </para>

            <para>- They could do so, but the insured person would not be compelled to act on such a recommendation. I have been told that it is desirable to give some recognition in this bill to the existence of friendly societies&#39; dispensaries. I quite agree to that, but I suggest that the most appropriate place would be either in clause 57, in respect of which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has circulated a proposed amendment, or in clause 59, in regard to which I have given notice of an amendment providing for the insertion of &#34; friendly societies&#39; dispensaries &#34;. </para>

          <para>. - I was glad to hear the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> state that an effort will be made to give recognition in the bill to the friendly societies&#39; dispensaries. I suggest that the dispensaries  should be given panels of contributors. They have been able to carry on their good work by reason of the fact that they have a large number of permanent subscribers. They do not conduct open retail shops similar to those of ordinary chemists, as their business is confined to the dispensing of medicines for their sick members. They have been instrumental in keeping down the cost of medicines, and preventing the chemists from exploiting the public. When the new insurance scheme comes info operation they will lose many of their subscribers, and it would be deplorable if they should be no longer able to carry on their useful work. The service rendered by them has been of a high order, and the drugs supplied by them are of the best quality. It is claimed that they operate only in congested industrial aims, but these are  the localities in which the poorer classes, who, particularly, require cheap medicines of good quality, reside. </para>

          <para>.- As I understand that there are to be flat rates for the dispensing of prescriptions, I should be glad to know whether provision will be made for a sliding scale of charges in order to cover the extra cost of drugs in country districts. Such extra cost would include freight, and, although the freight on drugs of relatively high value hut small bulk might not represent a great amount, it is probable that country chemists, who buy drugs in small quantities, have to pay more for them than is charged to the larger dispensaries in the cities. </para>

        <para class="block">If the clause be passed as it stands many thousands of subscribers who suffer from some disability will have to be off duty for seven days before obtaining any benefit whatever from the fund. The fact that benefits will not be payable for any period under seven days must obviously benefit the fund to the detriment of the subscribers. One of the great objections that honorable members on this side of the committee have to this scheme is that it is not sufficiently liberal. Why should subscribers who suffer from influenza, dengue fever, or colds, with a consequent disablement for any period less than seven days, be denied a benefit? The Northern Ireland act is much more liberal than this bill in this connexion. The Government should treat subscribers at. least as generously as friendly societies treat their members. The 400,000 members of friendly societies in Australia are able to obtain sickness benefits on the first day of their incapacity. They may obtain a certificate from a medical practitioner at once, and become eligible for benefits in respect of even one day&#39;s sickness. The conservative view of the Government in this respect is not justified. As the amendment is reasonable, I hope that it will be accepted, particularly as the Treasurer has assured us that it is desired to treat subscribers at least as liberally as members of friendly societies are treated. </para>

          <para>. - In considering a point of this description we should not confine our attention entirely to the one matter. In drafting this scheme the Government had to face several alternatives in different directions. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.^</inline> We must take a wide view of the general benefits proposed. Only a certain amount of money will bc provided, and we must determine how it may best be disbursed. The. Government decided to provide the maximum amount possible for disablement benefit. This meant that some curtailment would have to bo made in respect of other benefits. It was thought that it was in the public benefit to curtail sickness benefits to some extent so that disablement benefits could be made as generous as possible. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has said that friendly societies allow sickness benefits from the first day of sickness, but I point out that in those organizations disablement benefits decline rapidly after the lapse of a certain period. In one society a payment of 15s. a week is made for 26 weeks, a payment of 5s. for the succeeding 52 weeks, and thereafter a payment of only ls. 6d. a week. In three other societies the payment dwindles to 2s. 6d. a week after eighteen months&#39; disablement, and in one society it falls to 6s. a week. The disablement benefit under the Government&#39;s scheme is maintained indefinitely at 15s. a week for male subscribers. If the committee were to accept the view of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and extend the sickness benefit, it would have to curtail certain other benefits in order to maintain the solvency of the fund. I direct, the attention of honorable members to an amendment that the Government has circulated which provides for the elimination of sub-clause 3. If that amendment be agreed to, the object of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition will be met to some slight extent. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> to give further consideration to this clause. I have had a long experience with factory workers, and have discovered that there is little fear of malingering. A man will not sacrifice a wage of ?4 or ?5 a week, for a sickness benefit of ?1 a week. Workers are more concerned about the first week or two of sickness benefit than about the period during which total disablement benefits may be payable. It has been said that members of friendly societies begin to draw the sickness benefit of ?1 a week immediately the medical certificate is given. I should say that 75 per cent, of the workers who will como under this particular provision will be absent from work on account, of sickness for only a week, a fortnight, or three weeks. They do not wish to remain away from their work for longer than is necessary, because, while absent, they are losing ?3 or ?4 a week. If they have to wait for fourteen days before becoming entitled to one week&#39;s sick pay, many of them will be deprived of any relief. I feel ashamed when I realize how much more generous is the provision that is made in Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia, Finland and England. It is remarkable that, at a time when existing social legislation is being improved all over the world, this Government should introduce a measure which makes worse the_ conditions now enjoyed here and which provides for less benefit than that enjoyed under the scheme in operation in England. The Treasurer exaggerates the advantages of those provisions which will not cost anything, but does not emphasize those that are very important to the workers of this country. He should give further consideration to the matter. </para>

          <para>. -  I add my persuasions to those that have just been uttered, although I do not know that I should be prepared to go quite so far as the proposal of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> As the bill is founded largely on the British scheme, we should at least adopt the corresponding provision in the British act, which makes provision for the payment of sickness benefit from the fourth day onwards. The statistics of the friendly societies suggest that the average period of sickness for which benefit is claimed and paid is from ten to twelve days. If six days is to be fixed as a waiting period, the man who has been contributing for many years without making any claim on the fund will be required to make too much of a concession. What the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> has said regarding the schemes in the Central European States is quite right. They have modelled their schemes on the British plan. We also have largely done so; but in this particular feature - and it is a very substantial feature - we have departed from the British act to a greater extent than may appear on the surface. It is less generous than the corresponding provision in the British measure, to an amount of at least &#163;250,000 a year. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has pointed out that in some other respects the provisions of this measure are more liberal; for example, in the longcontinuing disablement benefit. </para>

            <para>- That is true. But, after all, disablement benefit, fortunately, will be enjoyed by comparatively few of the contributors, while on the other hand the bulk of the contributors will, unfortunately, be in a position from time to time to establish claims in respect of short periods of illness. It would be a pity if their claims were mct by the refusal to recognize them until the seventh day. </para>

          <para>. -  In big services, such as the transport service, a man who is absent from his employment because of sickness is required to furnish a medical certificate not later than, usually, the third day. To be effective the clause should provide for payment on the first day in order that those concerned will not be left for a week without payment. Many men suffer from short illnesses, and under this scheme they will derive no benefit. The honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> has stated that fourteen days appears to be the average time for the claiming of sick benefits by members of friendly societies. I am quite sure that men who, in their service, have to submit themselves to medical inspection, and may therefore be regarded as healthy, nevertheless suffer from time to time from brief illnesses, which frequently arise from the nature of their employment: Under the clause as it stands, they will not derive any benefit. It is when men lose their wages for a week or more that they begin to find themselves in financial difficulties. I understand that one of the objects of the bill is to prevent that from occurring. The amendment of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> therefore, merits consideration. Take the case of a. man who is absent from his work for seven days. Would it not he .reasonable to date the benefit from the first day of his illness? If thu proposal of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition were accepted, that would indicate that an appeal to reason can be made in these matters. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has referred to the greater disablement benefits which are provided for under this measure. Probably in those places with which he made the comparison, the contributions are lower. I do not wish to say anything to antagonize the Treasurer in regard to this proposal. As one who has had considerable experience oyer a long period in handling matters of this kind for men in trade unions, I give my assurance that these short periods of illness most affect the solvency of the men, particularly the lower paid men. During illnesses of short duration, they begin to get behind with their payments. Unless the suggestions of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> the honorable member for  Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> are considered and adopted, this bill will not be as effective as i he Treasurer desires. If the honorable gentleman would give an assurance in the direction sought considerable satisfaction would result. </para>

            <para>- I had a practical case in point the other day. A man who was greasing my car said that he would like to know where he stood under the national insurance scheme. He said that his boss usually gave him &#34;a fair go,&#34; and if he were sick for a few days or for a period up to a week he was paid full wages. He said that the employees made concessions in return for that consideration, but that if the employer were called upon under the national insurance scheme to contribute ls. 6d.- a week in respect of each of his employees, an employee who became sick would probably be told that he would have to claim sick pay from the insurance fund. Those employees, however, will not be able to participate in the sickness benefit until after they have been incapacitated for a period of seven days. Like the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart),</inline> I am amazed that the Government did not see fit to follow the provisions of the British legislation in this respect, particularly in view of the. fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear recommended in his report that the sickness benefit should commence on the fourth day of incapacity and continue to be paid for a total of 26 weeks. In other respects this bill follows his recommendations practically line for line. </para>

If the more liberal benefit can be provided under the British legislation, there seems to be no reason why it cannot he provided in this bill. I trust that the Treasurer will give serious consideration to the matter, and. if he is not prepared to go as far as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition suggests and commence the sickness benefit on the first day of incapacity, he will at. least undertake to amend the bill to provide that sickness benefit commence on the fourth day of incapacity. </para>

        <para class="block">Die  &#39;.treasurer  to say that the provisions ot this bill are more liberal in some respects than the British legislation; those who have closely studied the British scheme claim that, in the main, its provisions are much more generous. Under this clause a large  number  of people, who become subject to minor ailments, will have to wait for a period of seven days before they will become eligible to participate in the sickness benefit. I agree with the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> that these illnesses of short duration frequently have disastrous effects on those in receipt of low rates of pay, and for that reason I  suggest that the Government might very well give sympathetic consideration to the request made  on  their behalf. All the various societies that administer ..provident funds commence the sick pay benefit  on  the first day  of  illness. One firm which administers its own provident fund pays a sickness benefit, not of &#163;1 a week, but of &#163;2 5s. a week to male members, and a smaller amount to adult females, from the first day of illness. The fact firms such as that consider it desirable that The payments of, sickness benefit be commenced from the first day of incapacity should influence the Treasurer to be more -generous. I agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that to provide for the payment of sickness benefit on the fourth day of incapacity would be far better than the present provision; this would provide a benefit similar to that enjoyed under the British scheme. But at the same time I urge the Treasurer to agree to the suggestion made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. Deferment of the payment of sickness  benefit in respect of those who become totally incapacitated does not affect the position, because the majority of such persons would subsequently be entitled to invalid pensions, lt seems to me that throughout i his bill the Treasurer&#39;s aim has been to relieve the old-age pensions fund by placing a burden on this fund. I do not want, however, to use  that  for an argument, but I urge the  Treasurer  to do something to  meet  the representations that have been made  from this  side of the committee. With the utmost respect, I contend that members on this side have a more intimate knowledge of the requirements and difficulties of poor people than has the Treasurer. I support wholeheartedly the proposal of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and I hope that the Treasurer will give very serious consideration to the request made. </para>

But, in response to representations from all sides of the chamber, I am agreeable, on behalf of the Government, to amend the clause so that the benefit shall commence on the fifth day. That is quite an expensive concession. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Walter</inline> Kinnear&#39;s report, as has been said, recommended that the benefit should start on the fourth day; but I would direct attention to the fact that the report was written over twelve months ago, and that additional benefits have since been included. The scheme to-day is very different from the one dealt with in his report. The difference amounts to many hundreds of thousands of pounds. I consider that the Government is acting reasonably in altering the seventh day to the fifth day of incapacity, especially as it has given way on clauses 62 and 63. </para>
