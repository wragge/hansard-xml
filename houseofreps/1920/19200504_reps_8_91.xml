      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. TUDOR</inline>(Yarra) &#91;3.59&#93;.- I should be glad if the Minister in charge of the House would intimate what business is to be proceeded with on Tuesday next, and what Bills we shall be called upon to deal with during the week. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JAMES</inline>PAGE (Maranoa) &#91;4.0&#93;. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Government a matter of the most serious importance to Queensland, and particularly to the residents of the western part of that State who are now suffering from a severe drought. Those who are handfeeding and watering their herds and flocks in Western Queensland have experienced the further catastrophe of a shortage of petrol. They can obtain no petrol to keep going the oil engines used for pumping water, and their position is one of the direst peril. Could not the Government have the stocks of petrol in Brisbane, Rockh amp ton, and other centres, now being used chiefly for motor cars and &#34;joy&#34;  rides,  distributed amongst the people out West for industrial purposes only? When the sugar question was before us two or three weeks ago, no difficulty was experienced by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in obtaining statistics as to the supply of sugar throughout the length and breadth of Australia. It should, therefore, be an easy matter to obtain statistics as to the supplies of petrol in the Commonwealth. I ask the Government, in order to save these men &#34;out back&#34; practically from ruin to commandeer the petrol now in the big centres, and to distribute it for industrial purposes in Western Queensland. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Sir JOSEPH</inline>COOK (ParramattaMinister for the Navy) &#91;4.2&#93;.  -  Before disposing of the Repatriation Bill on Tuesday next, I understand that the House will be asked by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to agree to a motion conveying to our sailors and soldiers the thanks of the Parliament and people of the Commonwealth for the services they have rendered.

          <para>That the thanks of this House be accorded to the officers, warrant officers, petty officers, and men of the Royal Australian Navy for their heroic services during four years of war in the guardianship of Australia and her commerce from the attacks of a lawless foe, for their unceasing vigilance in the patrol of many seas, for their courage and skill in safely convoying their soldier comrades to the main theatres of operations, and for their efficient co-operation with the Grand Fleet of the Empire. </para>

            <para>.- I rise to second the motion. I regret exceedingly that the health of the Prime Minister is such that he is unable to do justice to himself by speaking to it, but I am pleased to know that so far as this Parliament is concerned we have practically come to an end of the war. The motion embraces quite a number of people, including some of ourselves, but I think there are others who should not have been omitted. I understand that 95 per cent, of the home service men volunteered for service abroad, and were unable to get away. </para>

              <para>- I believe that was the percentage. I know men who gave up good positions and volunteered, but were kept in Australia. They do not get any of the benefits of the Repatriation Act, and are not included in the war gratuity, and the least we can do is to extend our thanks to them. Again, there are the men of the mercantile marine. In the discussion of the War Gratuity Bill the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> mentioned cases of men of that service who were torpedoed twice. We are not according our thanks to them. </para>

I do not depreciate the services rendered by all the classes mentioned in the motion, but I think that home service men, war workers, munition workers, men of the mercantile marine, and men who served in the auxiliary naval force and citizen forces, compulsorily called up for garrison artillery work, guarding our own shores, shouldbe included in the motion. </para>

            <para>. - I support the motion. We are yet too close to the war to realize what our people have done during the struggle. We know that those who went away from Australia did their fair share, and that if it had not been for the Army and Navy of the Empire we would not be sitting here today, and the position of Australia would have been very different. We are not yet able to regard with a proper perspective whatwe owe to those who went into that hell for nearly five years&#39; fighting for the preservation of the liberties we are enjoying to-day. The heartfelt thanks of this House and of the nation should go out to those who preserved those liberties for us. </para>

            <para>- The Government have been giving a great deal of attention to this matter. Parliament has amended the Act many times, and every time the House has been led to expect that there  would be a great improvement, that cases would be more expeditiously heard, and that justice would be more effectively and speedily clone; but it can hardly be said that the facts of a very lengthy experience of the working of the Act have warranted those expectations. The Government are very anxious to exercise the limited powers at their disposal to the very best advantage, and for that reason have convened a conference of all persons interested, in order that we may seek counsel and advice from them. Those who are charged with the conduct of industrial affairs in unions will agree with me that there is great room for improvement. I have no bias in one direction or another. If we can secure industrial peace by means of the Arbitration Court well and good, but it is obvious that we must use every effort to secure it. I am hopeful that those who from their long experience are very familiar with the causes that lead to industrial disputes as well as the means that now exist for their settlement will at this conference be able from their joint wisdom to suggest to the Government a means whereby, at any rate, we may improve the existing machinery. More than that I cannot say, but it would be an unwise policy &#34;to amend the law by patching it up on the lines we have already followed in the past. I see no reason for believing that from such a means any lasting good could come. </para>

            <para>- No ; the Senate is justifying its existence. The motive of the honorable member for Echuca in providing that the Government should advance money to soldiers for co-operative purposes was of the very highest. Those of us who have tried in various ways to bring about a better condition of society welcome anything in the nature of co-operation. But we must protect Government funds by providing that all attempts at cooperation shall be upon a business basis. The honorable member pointed out the serious discrepancy between our attitude in advancing without security up to &#163;650 for house, stock, and implements to assist people to go upon the land, whilst not advancing money to enable soldiers to engage in other enterprises. That is quite true ; but honorable members will recollect that when repatriation was first discussed, everybody was hopeful that nearly all returned soldiers would desire to go upon the land. Land settlement was to be the solution of all our difficulties, and a Committee, of which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> was a member, considered proposals for advancing as much as &#163;70,000,000 to enable men to go upon the land. We have found, however, that not more than 5 per cent, of the 250,000 returned soldiers desire to settle upon the land, and I am sure the honorable member for Echuca will realize that a great many of those who are going upon the land will unhappily fail. Land and estate agents are of opinion that within a few years a large number of soldiers&#39; farms will be on the market, because the soldier farmers will discover they have no taste for the work, and will endeavour to get back to the cities. My alternative amendment will provide that if any returned soldiers desire to put up their own money in cash or war bonds for the purpose of engaging in co-operative enterprises, the Government shall advance money to them on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis. </para>

            <para>- I have already explained that the policy of advancing money to enable men to go upon the land, without requiring them to put up any of their own capital, was conceived for the very special purpose of encouraging men to leave the over-populated cities and settle the vacant areas. If we wish to save our civilization we must make country life more attractive in every way. Any business man knows that there are hundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia who are prepared to go into cooperative or other businesses if somebody else will find the money. </para>

          <para>- I was about to draw the attention of the Government to the remarks of the Minister for Work3 and Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> when dealing with this amendment on Friday last. That honorable gentleman said that the Government would stand to its &#34;duties,&#34; and, going further, added that the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> sought to go back on a decision of the House. But what are the Government attempting now but to go back on a decision of the House? The Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> accepted the amendment when the Bill was originally before us, and it was passed on the, voices; but now, judging from that honorable gentleman&#39;s remarks and interjections to-day, it is desired to reverse that decision. Now that the Commission is to be appointed, I shall endeavour to insist that this clause be retained in the Bill. The measure, as it stands, may be classed as purely and simply a Pensions Bill. The Commission would not have anything to do were this clause to be deleted. Its retention would, at any rate, provide some work ; it would, in a measure, justify the Commissioners&#39; appointment. The principle underlying the. establishment of industries, as set out in the clause, is one which has been welcomed by returned men, and by thousands of people in the country districts, if the shoals of letters which I have received are at all indicative. I wish to deal now with the reasons furnished by the Senate for opposition to the clause. The first is - </para>

True, there are not so many left who still require that provision shall be made for them; but the fact remains that numbers have not yet been re-established in civil life, and it is these whom I wish to help. The establishment of such industries as I have suggested would certainly prove of very great assistance to men who are without regular employment, who do not follow any defined trade or calling. While dealing with the matter of woollen mills and similar enterprises a few days ago, I was pointing out that there would be very little risk of loss in launching upon such industries, provided that the right class of men were chosen. </para>

            <para>- The suit length contained 3 1-5 lb. of wool. Allowing a high price, namely, 4s. 6d. per lb. for clean, scoured wool, that would amount to 14s. 5d. That is to say, out of my suit length, the producer would get 14s. 5d., while the manufacturer and the middleman would make &#163;5 5s. 7d. Do not honorable members think that that example suggests a good opportunity for our returned men to make a payable proposition out of the establishment of a woollen mill? Do they not think that here is demonstrated a far better opportunity to succeed than returned men are ever likely to have on the land ? I do not wish to say anything with regard to the Government&#39;s land settlement policy; but I fear there will be a lot of failures among returned soldier settlers. The principle held by the various Governments of buying out one man in order to put another on the land is most unsatisfactory, and altogether unsound. In my own district, land values have appreciated from &#163;1 to &#163;4 an acre during the past three months, and more land has changed hands during, those three months than in the course of the previous three years. There are large areas of unalienated land in the Commonwealth. I do not know to what extent they exist in other States, but, presumably, they would be even larger than in Victoria. In our north-western mallee country there are 5,400,000 acres which have been graded as first, second, and third class land. I have consistently advocated that this land should be given to our returned boys in living areas of, say, 640 acres of first-class land, or 1,000 acres of second, or 1,500 acres of third-class land. There are very few but who would make a success upon such blocks. Of course, I would stipulate certain conditions, and not leave the way open for returned soldiers to leave their holdings in twelve months, or in two or three years. I would compel them to live on their lots for a certain time. It would be &#34;up to &#34; the Government to furnish necessary improvements, such as good roads, railway facilities, water conservation, and the like. There is sufficient land in the north-western mallee areas to repatriate 5,000 men; and, as an outcome of their activities, the opening up of this territory would mean, within five to ten years, an increase of the wheat yield in Victoria amounting to between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent. The Government have continually cried out for increased production; the only way to bring that about is to place more men on the land. They cannot hope to look for increased production, however, by going in for a policy of buying out one man and putting in another. The third reason given by the Senate for disagreeing to my amendment is - </para>

        <para class="block">I am perfectly sure that a number of the returned soldiers have been settled on the land under conditions which make it impossible for them to hope for success. I regret to have to say that I believe we shall have a great number of failures amongst the returned men settled on the land. I will not say that there would be no failures under my amendment, but I believe the number would be less than we may expect under the land settlement proposals for repatriation. In any case if we advanced a certain amount, and I have suggested &#163;250, in connexion with the building of soldiers&#39; homes, the bricks, mortar, and machinery would not run away, though a number of the men might become dissatisfied, and leave their cooperative organizations. </para>
        <para>In regard to the last reason given by the Senate for disagreeing to my amendment, I should like to say that the Government, by accepting the amendment in the first- place, showed that they approved of the proposal. <inline font-style="italic">T3o</inline> provision has been made for soldiers&#39; industrial concerns. I challenge the Government to say whether any provision has been made for the proper repatriation of large numbers of men who are not skilled in different trades and callings. My main reason for submitting my amendment was to meet the case of these men. I hope that honorable members on both sides are fully alive to the necessity of doing something for these men for whom at present  no provision has been made. Nothing can be done for them as individuals, but we may hope to do something for them collectively. I hope that the Committee will insist on the amendment, and&#34; with all due respect to the honorable member for Capricornia, I trust that his alternative amendment will not be agreed to. </para>

Perhaps it would be as well to remind the country of the nature of the work done by the Senate.

        <para>The honorable member for Capricornia gave us a list of private businesses, the owners of which had gone insolvent. It is because there have been so many failures in private enterprises that the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> is disposed to try a new experiment by bringing men together to work cooperatively to prevent such failures. </para>
        <para class="block">The cry of the Government has been for more production, and the adoption of the amendment would be. one of the most practical steps that could be taken to increase production. I could mention a number of things in connexion with which men co-operating might do much to develop the resources of the country. For instance, the greasy wool now exported from Australia could be scoured here by unskilled labour. We have plenty of water, we have the wool, and we have unemployed labour. All that would be necessary would be for the Government to assist returned men in different parts of the country to work co-operatively in the scouring of wool before it was brought to the large centres of population. In that way the Government would be doing much to settle people in the country districts. Again, if we consider the building trade, we know that great difficulty is being experienced in providing homes for returned soldiers. If returned men were allowed to co-operate in the building trade for the building pf soldiers&#39; homes, a very great deal of good might be effected. If the Government were prepared to advance to me a working co-operatively &#163;200 or &#163;300 to buy material for the purpose, a very considerable stimulus could be given to the erection of soldiers&#39; homes. The Government would have a lien on the buildings, and practical control of the whole business. That would help the soldiers, and would find employment for our people. If it is to be left to men to take up the building of these homes by day labour or by contract on the old lines, there will be .no stimulation of the business. It seems to me that under the amendment we might very easily start the building of soldiers&#39; homes under the co-operative system. The honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> was telling me coming over in the train that there are large quantities of beautiful timber in his district which could be cut and supplied by co-operative groups of returned men for the erection of soldiers&#39; homes. He is in a position to assure the Government that there is plenty of good timber in his district for the purpose, and the Government might assist returned soldiers in the establishment of saw-mills there. Under existing conditions, the Government are compelled to pay the high prices for timber for soldiers&#39; homes fixed by the Combine that exists in the timber industry, and these high prices are ultimately passed on to the returned soldiers. I have been in the building trade all my life, and I am confident that a soldier&#39;s home which costs under existing conditions about &#163;700 could be built for &#163;500 if it were not for the action of the Combines controlling the timber industry and the manufacture of bricks and cement. </para>

Under the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> the Government could assist returned soldiers to establish co-operative saw-mills, and there would be a ready market for all the timber they could cut, as there are thousands of men who are still awaiting homes. The Government might also assist returned soldiers to co-operate in the manufacture of bricks. There is a good market for bricks in every city in Australia, and bricks, as well as timber, are required for the erection of soldiers&#39; homes. The Brick Combine in New South Wales has put up the price of bricks to as high as &#163;5 per 1,000. I can remember the time when bricks could be purchased for 25s. per 1,000. </para>

It is the policy of the country that they should be as soon <inline font-style="italic">&#38;s</inline> possible established again in civil life, and the only question is as to the best method to be adopted for this purpose. This should not be regarded as a party matter. We ought all to unite in an earnest endeavour to solve this unemployed problem. Upon my return to Sydney, only last week, I had occasion to pass the Repatriation Offices, where I saw hundreds of men going up to register their names as applicants for sustenance. When is that practice going to cease? The Government are merely feeding the men from day to day without building up any permanent industries in which they may obtain employment. Here is an opportunity for them to establish upon a co-operative basis new industries in which our returned soldiers may labour to produce that wealth for which the country is crying out. Yet the Government come down here and without assigning any reasons for their change of front, ask us not to insist upon our amendment with which the other branch of the Legislature has disagreed. </para>

            <para>- The amendment of the honorable member for Echuca was reluctantly adopted by the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton),</inline> who said, &#34; I recognise that the numbers are up,&#34; and accordingly it was agreed to. Had the Government been guided by the honorable gentleman, the scene which occurred on Friday afternoon would have been avoided. After the vote which was then taken, any self-respecting Government would have gone out of office. I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and shall oppose the decision arrived at by the Senate. At the present time the other branch of the Legislature does not truly represent the people of this country. An election took place recently, and as a result I believe that the Senate has no constitutional right to reject any measure passed by this Chamber. </para>

I am quite sure that that reference must &#39;have been made unwittingly, and that if its author had thought tie matter out calmly he would never have made the suggestion which he did. In so far as it -was possible to redeem them, the Government have fully redeemed their promises to our returned soldiers. Literally, they have absolutely redeemed them. There is no country in the world which has acted more generously to its soldiers than has Australia through the medium of the Commonwealth Government. The State Governments, too, have acted similarly to the very limit of their resources. I admit frankly that the services of the splendid men from this country can never be adequately recognised in a material sense. But we have gone to- the very uttermost of our resources in order to show our gratitude to these men. I am opposed to the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and I ask the Committee to be guided by the reasons which have been submitted to this Chamber by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline></para>

            <para>- I am; but I wish to place it upon a solid foundation. Thirty years ago I was a foundation member of what is to-day one of the strongest co-operative societies in Australia. For about twenty years it had to struggle against great difficulties, but today it is one of the best institutions of its kind in the world, because it is upon a financially sound basis. If the honorable member for Echuca wishes us to embark upon similar enterprises, why does he not seek to establish co-operative industries for our soldiers by the application to that purpose of their war gratuities? </para>

            <para>- In the encouragement of land settlement and in the repatriation of our soldiers the Government have behaved handsomely. Experience has already proved that we are going to lose millions of pounds upon our scheme of land settlement for our soldiers, and that scheme rests on an infinitely sounder basis than does the  establishment  of co-operative industries in the way that is now proposed. In South Australia there are returned men who intend launching out on the co-operative principle to the extent of &#163;250,000 by applying their war gratuities to this purpose. </para>

I repeat that the Government have gone to the limit of their  resources in order to provide for our returned soldiers, and I want my honorable friends in the corner, who appear to regard themselves as the guardian angels of the farmers of Australia to remember that if we have a dry winter Australia will be in the grip of the worst drought ever experienced in the history of this country. Should this winter be unfavorable the Governments will be at their wit&#39;s end to meet the obligations resting upon them, and to so finance as to keep a large proportion of our farmers on the land. Honorable members of the Country party must be aware of this danger. I speak from bitter experience of many droughts, and, therefore, I ask the Committee not to accept any hazardous scheme involving huge financial obligations.

            <para>- The Commission when appointed will have charge of administration with regard to pensions, vocational training, and hospitals for disabled returned soldiers. We cannot expect men who may be experts in that particular aspect of repatriation to be capable of dealing with this &#34; jackofalltrades &#34; scheme. A Minister worth his salt will approve of very few of the schemes that may come before him under this proposal. As I have already pointed out, there will be abundant opportunities for our returned soldiers to enter into cooperative enterprises by the investment of their gratuity bonds.. Some have already determined upon this course. </para>

          <para>. - The reference by the honorable mem ber for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> to people who have gone insolvent, or dropped out of business reminds me that in the early days we always heard of the men who were lucky, but never of those who had gone under financially in the search for gold, and who had lost their health as well. We all know that while some nien are unsuccessful in a certain line of business, others can make a huge success of it. </para>

            <para>- Yes. If they were good enough for that, they must be good enough for these businesses. I owe my conversion to the amendment if conversion were needed, to the arguments of the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> when the Bill was going through.  His  arguments reminded me of a well-known advertisement - &#34; it touches the spot.&#34; We know that men who left their labouring jobs to go to the Front were the men who could be depended upon to do things. Whenever there was anything to do, they were the men who attempted it. They did it, and Australia rang from end to end in praise of their glorious achievements. The soldier was good enough to go away to fight, and do everything necessary to make him a successful soldier; but because he was a labourer, a factory hand, or a farm employee, he is not good enough to be given a start in business on his return. Are the Government in favour of keeping such men navvies or labourers for ever,, merely because they happened to be so employed before they went abroad ? I am supporting the proposed new clause because I am strongly in favour of giving them an opportunity to improve their positions. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> says that the soldiers should sub? scribe &#163;1 for &#163;1. In my own case, if it had not been for the generosity of a squatter at Barcaldine I would not have been worth 5s. to-day. In my early days, when I was employed in the country, this gentleman asked&#39; me how much I was prepared to provide if he gave me a chance to start dairying. I informed him that I had only &#163;10, and he replied, &#34;Keep that to buy utensils, and I will supply you with the cows.&#34; He did as he promised, and thus gave me an opportunity to start on my own account. To-day I  am a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, mainly because I received some assistance when I needed&#39; it. At that time I was a shearer, or shed hand, and was also casually employed on railway or other work. But I was young, with plenty of ambition, and I succeeded because I was helped. Do honorable members who are opposing the proposed new clause say that the men whom we say should benefit are not competent to be their own masters? Why should we ask them to find &#163;100? We did not ask them for anything when they were going to fight for us. </para>

            <para>- Yes, that is all we asked them to subscribe. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> seems to think that co-operative undertakings of the character mentioned are not likely to bo successful. We know that many who start in business fall by the wayside, but most of these men, if given the opportunity, will be successful. Many who have benefited largely by their experience abroad would prove satisfactory employers, and I do not think a large percentage would make mistakes if given the opportunity. Many of the returned soldier&#39;s who have been placed on the land in Queensland are doomed to failure because they know nothing of rural work, and when they realize that they do not understand the business they naturally become disheartened. Certain sections of the industrial community are seeking to limit a week&#39;s work to forty hours, but we have to remember that men engaged in rural pursuits are in many instances endeavouring to do forty hours&#39; work in twenty-four hours. When many men who have recently gone on the land realize that they have to work laboriously and continuously to reap any reward, they will lose heart. The honor-, able member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has said that the land is always an. asset, because it cannot be removed; but every one knows that. In Queensland some years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barlow</inline> established a group system of land settlement, and I, in common with others interested, hoped  that we were going to show what could be done by successful cooperation. At the time I was earning 9s. per day at railway work, and I placed 4s. of each day&#39;s earnings into a co-operative concern in the belief that it would succeed. The incident occurred after the 1891 strike, and I do not quarrel with the honorable member for Capricornia concerning his fears, because he knows what happened&#39;. </para>

            <para>- Yes. But when we are dealing with men possessing the independent spirit that most Australians have - and, thank God, they have it - we have no occasion to fear. In connexion with the Alice River settlement, to&#39; which I am referring, the Government of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was then leader helped the settlers, and in 1900, when only five settlers were left, freeholds were granted&#39;, with the result that the settlers immediately disposed of their land to the highest bidder. The honorable member for Capricornia believes that something similar will occur in this instance, but he must remember that there is a different feeling abroad to-day, and men know that they have to work to live. Our returned soldiers have gone through fire and water, yea, in many instances, hell itself could not have been worse, and&#39; surely they are able to launch out now on their own account in their own country. Even supposing the proposal may mean a loss of millions, we should be prepared to give the system a trial, without which there is no chance of achieving success. Fancy asking men to put up &#163;100 when all the money they possess is what they earn. The honorable member for Wakefield is afraid that men will desire to be assisted in &#34; wild cat&#34; schemes - enterprises that are not likely to prove profitable. Quite a number of people would say that the honorable member himself is not a success. </para>

He has made a lot of enemies by his firmness, but he has steered clear of all danger, and the public of Australia, and the soldiers particularly, should be grateful for what he has done. Knowing now what the feeling of the Committee is, I feel sure that the Minister will stand by the clause, and&#39; I can imagine I hear him saying, &#34;  Colonel, don&#39;t  shoot; I will come down.&#34; If he wishes for a repetition of what happened on Friday last, he will get it, </para>

            <para>- I know men who have lost money in squatting, and in other businesses. &#39; But, generally speaking, success or failure depends largely on management. A number of soldiers could take up milling, some devoting themselves to the finding and fell ing of the timber, others acting as teamsters, others working at the mill. They would have to choose one of their number to manage the concern, but there is as much intelligence among working men as among those of other classes, and, given a chance, many men would make a success out of a business of this kind. Of course, in a case where all wished to be the boss, the thing would fail. What better can we do than to give these men a chance? I do not think that if they were put on their honour, it would cost, as the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> said, millions of pounds. </para>

In 1918 the population of Adelaide was 235,751, and that of the rest of South Australia 210,000; and the population of Melbourne was 723,500, and that of the rest of Victoria 700,258.

My object is not to save the Government or the position of any honorable member of the House. My purpose is to save the country districts and the country towns from the process of gradual extinction, and to assist soldiers living in country districts to form cooperative establishments. Soldiers who live in the cities would probably find it advantageous to move their abodes to very salubrious and agreeable country towns for the purpose of securing the same advantage.

            <para>- No soldier is assisted on the land unless he has a qualification certificate. To start with, there is an approval Board, and under the original arrangement with regard to land settlement we were very careful to get the whole of each man&#39;s experience before he went abroad. In that way we were assured that the men placed on the land would be those who had training for the occupation, but apparently no training is to be demanded from the man who asks to be financed in a co-operative concern. Men who have had twelve months&#39; vocational training are now anxious to be started in a co-operative boot factory, without having learned their trade by a long way. </para>

It is the final step that counts, and his final step was to assent to the proposal, which his silence when the clause was put to the Committee signified. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has not an ounce of backbone. Last week he was doing something which to-day he says was diametrically opposed to the interests of the country and those of returned soldiers. Why has this change come about? Simply because of a cursory discussion in another place, not a heart-to-heart talk such as we have here among men who are engaged ina practical sense in certain industries we are desirous of helping. </para>

            <para>- Another place ought to be reflected on for having sent us a Bill which had to be completely overhauled and sent back to it with an entirely new face on it. It is quite natural that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> should not recognise his own measure on its return. However, that is no reason for claiming that we have done anything wrong. According to the Minister for Home and Territories, there has never yet been a proposition put forward presenting so many avenues for throwing away money as this does. Did ever a Minister stand so selfcondemned out of his own mouth? The clause provides that the Repatriation Commission is to examine every application from a body of men. to start a  co-operative concern.. Six men may probably wish to start a saw-mill. The honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> pointed out last week the case of men engaged in: a saw-mill who were anxious to start on their own account, but had not the wherewithal to do so. There is &#39; no need for any qualification certificate from them. They have already been engaged in the practical work; but are we always to keep them in subservient positions, and say that we will do nothing to help them ? If we find such practical men willing to undertake a co-operative concern for their own advantage, why should we deny them the right to make a start? I know a young fellow at Red Hill, on the Mornington Peninsula, who before going to the- war was employed in a saw-mill.. He and a few other returned soldiers have purchased a saw-bench, and now they are turning out tens of thousands of fruit cases, and are doing well. Is it not desirable to help men of that character? Surely we are not going  back upon our emphatic and unanimous decision of last week? If the Repatriation Commission is not satisfied with any application for assistance under this provision, it will send practical men to find out where the mill is to be started, who are going to run it, and what previous experience they have had. And even if, after making exhaustive inquiries, the Commission is favorable, the&#39; proposal has still to be submitted to the Minister, and if he is not satisfied he can take it to Cabinet. Each application may have, to pass the criticism and verdict of three different courts before it is granted. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has said that if this proposal were taken to any financial institution it would be turned down. Co-operative companies are nearly always dependent upon bank overdrafts to help them to carry on, and if a bank is willing to assist them they are- all right; but I was associated with one co-operative rural industry which,, just as it was on the eve of success, and because it happened to be pushing certain private persons out of business, was told by the bank, &#34; We will not assist you any further.&#34; Many a co-operative concern in its initial stages has been frowned out of existence by financial institutions.. It seems to me that a plea has been put up this afternoon for vested interests. The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James Page)</inline> has shown very clearly how necessary it is that we should stand by these men, and help them to provide for their own requirements. In the building . of homes for returned soldiers, for instance, who could better supply the timber, the bricks, and other material required than the returned soldiers themselves ? And who has a better right to supply them? If, however, we adopt the Minister&#39;s proposal, we shall deny them that right. According to a statement in the- newspapers to-day, we have, unfortunately, in Victoria no&#39; less than 4,500 returned soldiers out of work. That is a disgraceful state of affairs. There may be. some who are unemployable - some whom it is hard to fit into any position - but I am quite certain that they are not all unfit to take up some kind of employment. We do hot seem to be doing very much for these men. Here we have an opportunity to help them. Are there likely to be . greater f ailures in this than in other phases of industry ? No. </para>

            <para>- A returned soldier applies to the State Board, secures a block of land. and has&#39;&#39; to conduct farming operations almost entirely without advice and assistance.  Under this scheme, however, we would have a combination of energy and. intelligence so that where one might fail a. party of half-a-dozen or more, because of their combined wisdom, would make good. The industries mentioned by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> are but a combination of one great industry&#39;. Who, for instance, has a better right to hold an interest in the management of woollen mills than the wool -growers ? And so with the clothing, tanning, and fellmongering trades. They are all related to primary industry. I hope that the Committee will insist upon the new clause inserted by us in the Bill last week. I am not in favour of the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Capricornia &#233;Mr. Higgs), which the Government are . accepting as the lesser of two evils. </para>

            <para>- That will not help them over a thousand hills. It will certainly be of assistance to some who are already in business, but it is lack of capital that, in most cases, brings about failure. That was the cause of the failure of the co-operative concern with which I was associated. If we had, possessed ample capital, we could have brushed aside the objections of the country bank manager, who knew little about our industry ; but, not having it, we were closed up like a book. Many of the banks and financial institutions will treatco-operative concerns in the. same way. Co-operation, however, has come to stay, and the more it is extended the better for the community. Those who vote against the clause will vote against one of the best propositions ever pub before Parliament, because it is designed to help returned soldiers to do for themselves what they are most anxious to do. I hope the Committee will stand by it. </para>

          <para>.- It seems to me that some honorable members are disposed to approach the consideration of this question in a fighting spirit- rather than to deal with it according to common-sense principles. I am convinced thatwe are all anxious to do what we honestly believe to be in the best interests of our returned men, and in the few remarks that I propose to make I shall follow along practical lines. As a rural producer engaged in the butter industry, I have had practical experience of the working of co-operative enterprises. Many honorable members will be aware of the fact that when the butter industry in Victoria was in a very bad way the State Government came to our assistance with a bonus, and that its help was most opportune. It put us in good heart, enabled us to wipe off our debts, and was also the means of putting the State on a solid footing. We have some 25,000 returned men either already in training or offering for vocational training. I have seen the work that is being carried out in the vocational training institute on St. Kilda-road, and it is,as I said a few days ago, a distinct credit to the Minister for Repatriation. Those learning various trades will soon become proficient in establishing industries such as those of furniture-making, upholstering, motor-body making, or blacksmithing, in each of which a dozen or twenty men could combine when a grant of, say, &#163;200 a man would enable them to put their business on a sound footing. It would enable them to become their own bosses, and the movement, as it grew would breaks-down, to a verylarge extent, the industrial unrest that now prevails. My desire is thatas many men as possible shallbe made self-reliant. I do not want men to be content to remain wageearners. I desire,on the contrary, to encourage the : men to become their own masters. The clause is not designed to induce men to lean on the Government forhelp. It makes f or combinations of individual effort. In this co-operative scheme we shall &#39;certainly have some failure&#39;s, but I am convinced that, if adopted, it will lead to the establishment of our returned men in a. number ofindustries, and will open up a vista of great possibilities to the industrial workers of Australia. We are all aware of the industrial unrest which exists today throughout the civilized world. I believe that, by encouraging men to combine and work along co-operative lines, we shall give very considerable assistance to the soldier, and do good to the nation as a whole. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Much is said nowadays of profiteering. Co-operation, I believe, would help to lessen the evil. What, for instance, would be the resultif a number of returned soldiers combined and entered the woollen trade? Wool will no doubt be dearer in the future, and profits will not be what they have been, but the industry still offers unlimited scope for the energy and enterprise of co-operative combinations. Last year we exported something like &#163;34,000,000 worth of wool. In. this, according to experts, there were 80 tons of manure; on which we paid freight to the old world, and which contained valuable by-products. All these are matters of importance. </para>
        <para> This&#39; may be described as a prospecting venture; arid no one can foretell the benefits that will result from it. By encouraging co-operation we shall, to some extent, remove the feeling of hatred that exists between  the .  worker and the capitalist.  It should be our desire to do all that is humanly possible to remove that&#39; feeling. If, by carrying out this proposal^ we can not only accomplish much &#39; iri tha&#39;t direction, but make &#39; men . more self-reliant, we shall do a good, service to the community. . Co-operative . efforts properly controlled would, to a&#39; large extent; enable the people to&#39; avoid the- enormous sums that are spent oh the. army of agents and middlemen ranged between the producer and the consumer. The Victorian Government has set us a. worthy example in the matter of cooperation,, by its action in making advances for the establishment of freezing works. The State Government advanced &#163;1 for &#163;1; and although the scheme was at first regarded as a harum-scarum one, it is going to prove one of the wisest upon which the State has ever embarked. </para>
        <para> Shortly&#39; put, this clause is designed to make our boys more self:reliant and independent. Representatives of country constituencies, after discussing the proposal with returned soldiers and their parents, are satisfied that under this scheme it will be possible to start a number of industries in rural towns, the residents of which will be able to render valuable assistance. &#39;We ask that- this scheme be given a trial. It must not be forgotten that it will be under the control . of the responsible Minister and the Cabi-net as a whole. It has been said that . we might have a change of. Ministry, but whatever Ministry is in power will have to accept full responsibility for its actions, and will have to account to the people. . It will not be possible for any Government to go very far along the wrong track without being pulled up by the people. I hope that the Government will insist upon the retention, of the clause, and am satisfied that if they do it will not only give satisfaction to our returned, boys, but will open up fruitful, sources of income in the near future. </para>

          <para>- The first reason given by another place for rejecting this amendment is &#34; because  it is not considered equitable to extend to collective bodies of soldiers benefits for which individual soldiers might &#39; hot be,&#39; eligible.&#34; That objection carries very little weight, because nothing in the amendment excludes any individual fromito benefits; it merely proposes that when&#39; a body of men desire to start in a co-: operative enterprise, the Government&#39;shall give them the opportunity... The&#39; second reason advanced by the Senate -was&#39; &#34; because the effect of the granting of the&#39; benefits contemplated by the amendment.&#39; would result in the unsettlement of the&#39; large majority of men whose re-establish-; ment in civil life has been already accomplished.&#34; In other words, Private John; Smith may throw down his pick in order to take up something better. It would1 not do to unsettle the hewer of wood and&#39;, the drawer of water. He has become a&#39; working bullock again, and it would not do to fill him with the hope of attaining to something higher. The third reason . is &#34;because grave financial loss to the Government, and dissappointment to bodies of men, may result from the starting of enterprises which may not prove successful.&#34; The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Poster)</inline> said that this amendment might involve the loss. of mil; lions of pounds. &#34; &#39; </para>

        <para>Imperial Force who had previously been farm labourers are to be given a chance of becoming their own masters. I ask the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> why he wishes to deny the same right to others? There are men owning farms to-day who never before were their&#39; own masters. Some of them may prove failures, but the majority of them will succeed. Why deny the same opportunity to others? I will instance a concrete case: Asa member of the Victorian Parliament I was approached by a returned soldier, who, prior to enlisting, drove a horse and dray. He had an opportunity to contract for municipal work in one of the northern towns, and he applied, through me, for an advance sufficient to enable him to purchase some horses and drays. The Repatriation Department, having ascertained that the man had not owned horses and drays before he went to the war, decided that he was not a fit and proper person to own them now, and his application was rejected. Fortunately, some business men in his district, who had a little more faith in the soldier than the Department apparently had, advanced him sufficient money to enable him to purchase a horse and dray, which today are his own property. In this amendment we are making a plea for the cooperative principle and its application to returned soldiers. If a number of men club together, the Government may advance them money for the purchase of a plant and building in order to carry out their enterprise, the Government retaining a lien over the plant and building. In other words, we ask the Government to say to a co-operative society of soldiers, &#34; We will set you up with &#163;2,000 worth of plant, over which we will hold a lien. You pay interest on the money advanced, and repay the capital over a period of years. Immediately the capital is repaid the plant will become your own.&#34; We do not argue that there are no objections to the proposal ; we do not say that there will be no failures. </para>

The Ministry do not attempt to help us; they seem determined to wipe the amendment out if they can. I appeal particularly to Ministerial members to support the amendment,which is put forward in no party spirit. When it was first proposed, the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> said that it was the most socialistic proposal ever brought before the House, but ten minutes afterwards he mildy accepted it. </para>

          <para>. - I do not suppose there is one honorable member who would not like to see this scheme stretched as far as possible. Every one will agree that honorable members on this side have been doing as much as has any one else to help the returned soldiers. We have as much sympathy for the man who threw down his pick and shovel, and went to the war, as we have for any other soldier. Many of that type were amongst the best men who went to the war. Quite a number, by their own ability and hard work, raised themselves from the ranks to high positions in the Army. Others, however, failed, and will continue to fail. Every honorable member is agreed that the present Minister for Repatriation! <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> is an excellent man for the job. He is a man of wide views and broad sympathies, and of firmness and courage, and he understands the repatriation question. The Government are taunted first with having accepted this amendment, and now with opposing it, but it has been submitted to the Minister for Repatriation, who has declared that it cannot be accepted without a risk of direct failure. Now honorable members are proposing a vote of censure upon the Minister whom everybody applauded, and who is conceded to be the best man for the job. He has told us what should be done, and I think we should respect his advice. We should show our trust in the Minister. We admit that he is qualified for the job; yet it is proposed that we should turn him down, and act in our own way regardless of what ruin may follow. Had the Minister accepted the amendment, there would have been no question as to its wisdom. We do not understand therepatriation problem as he does, and, for that reason, I cannot support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- He did not; all he did was to bring in the name of the Minister for the purpose of covering up the injustice proposed to be done to a great number of the men. I do not know that it is admitted that the present Minister is the best man in the world for the job. I make no reflection on the Minister for Repatriation, but I know there has been a waste of money in connexion with his Department - money that would have gone a long way to establish men in various industries. I understand that the annual amount paid for sustenance is something like &#163;2,000,000, and that is paid only because men who are willing to work cannot find avenues of employment. This amendment affords an opportunity to save a great deal of this annual expenditure of &#163;2,000,000 by giving the men opportunities to launch out for themselves. I point out to the honorable member for Robertson. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming)</inline> that nothing can be done under this amendment without the approval of the Minister for Repatriation, and if that honorable gentleman is all that he is claimed to be, he will be able to say yea or nay to any of the ventures proposed. </para>

I have not the exalted opinion of the Minister for Repatriation that some honorable members may have; but I would hesitate to cast any such reflection on him by suggesting that, although he has the deciding voice, these ventures will be a failure. When the war ceased we heard a great deal about &#34; Labour&#39;s new world&#34;; every newspaper had something to say on the subject; but now the war is over, and our liberties, for which our men bled and died, are won, the survivors are asked to go back into their old&#39; avenues of employment. </para>

The honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> is to be commended for his action. We all believe in the new world for labour, and, instead of asking the men to return to the old avenues, believe in providing fresh avenues where they may strike out on their own account. It is quite unnecessary to enumerate the various   turned soldiers, la addition, there is the woollen industry, and, like&#39; the honorable member for Echuca, I have in my electorate one or two  places  which would make- good centres for woollen mills.. I know nothing better than the scheme suggested by the amendment for inducing men to go into .the country,- and thus counteracting the  evils  of that centralization that. is keeping the Commonwealth back to-day. </para>

            <para>- Does the honorable member know that more money can be lost in saw-milling than in any other occupation? &#34; ; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. PARKER</inline> MOLONEY- Money can be lost in any industry. The honorable member for South Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riley)</inline> suggests to me that many of us lose money by being in this House, though I *do not know that many of us are trying to get. away from it. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. &#39;Poynton)</inline> asked whether any&#39; of us would put bur own money into the proposed enterprises. Well, from my knowledge of the men who have gone on certain areas of land in  my constituency, I venture to say that, although a number of them may struggle on for two, or it may be six years, in the end they will be out &#34; on the road.&#34; The reason for this is that, in most cases, the land is unsuitable, and the prices paid do not give them, a chance to reinstate themselves. The amendment, however, affords&#39; an opportunity ,to the men to club together. Lavish promises were made to those who have fought and bled for Australia, and now they are asking whether the Government will take the responsibility of encouraging them if they choose to&#39; club together and go into business, contributing their war gratuities to the ventures. Will the Government take the responsibility of saying &#34; No &#34; to such a proposal? At any rate, they would not have said &#34;No&#34; to such a request when these men were leaving Australia for the Front. It must not be forgotten that the men cannot go into these ventures without approval of the Minister for Repatriation. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>prowse  (Swan)  &#91;5.55&#93;.-  I have previously discussed the advantages and disadvantages of this &#39;amendment. On a previous occasion the House approved of the principle involved. The Senate set out various reasons for disagreeing to this amendment, and, while the fourth of  these is one to concern, us, jit should not shake our confidence in the principle. I suggest that a Committee be appointed to draw up a fresh clause. The one now before us is admittedly iri, a crude form, and I wonder that the draftsman should have approved of it. If . it is desirable to promote enterprises by the help . of Government advances, then, rightly, the matter -should be the subject of special legislation. The objection of the Senate embodying that point has weight, and it is only -reasonable and proper that the clause should be amended to meet that objection. The principle should be set </para>
        <para>Out  in proper form, together with a statement of adequate safeguards., This House, in agreeing to the co-operative principle, did not feel for one moment that it. was opening the way to a sink in which to throw millions of money. It has been stated that the land section of repatriation has nothing to do with the matter. As one who . took a prominent part in the repatriation of soldiers upon the land in ray State, I am -quite aware of the necessity for qualifying machinery in the legislation dealing with the subject. It was necessary for Boards to examine applicants with respect to their fitness generally to &#39; accept the responsibility of going upon the land and .bearing the consequential financial burden. It could not be expected \ therefore, that the Commonwealth Government should be responsible for the launching of a principle such  as isinvolved  at this moment without requiring every necessary form of security The clause should be amplified, - but I shall be greatly, surprised if honorable members depart from their agreement with the principle as it was originally placed before them. I have not consulted the honorable member for Echuca (Me. Hill), but I believe that he will see the wisdom of sending on for the consideration of another place a more adequately detailed clause, which would safeguard -both returned soldiers and the country, and which would provide- no opportunity for money to be wasted upon &#34;wild cat&#34; schemes. I cannot conceive that either  &#163;50,000,000  or  &#163;25,000,000  is likely to be spent in the direction involved by the principle. For example, I would not be -&#39; prepared to entertain applications for the establishment in cooperative&#39; businesses  with &#39;respect to men who have- already f- been :&#39; properly &#34; repatriated. &#39; * &#39; &#34;. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>gibson  &#39; (Corangamite)  &#91;6.0&#93;.-  There will be very great&#39; disappointment iri the country, and .-particularly among returned soldiers, if V.the .principle Of,. &#233;e operation as applied &#39; to the task repatriation is rejected. It is in itself no &#34; wild cat &#34; scheme, and neither need there be any &#34; wild cat &#34; project attaching to it.- , . It has already been pointed out that it would require to be placed upon a business basis, and that it would rest with the Commissi oners, and with, the Government, to see that proper business safeguards were taken in- regard to any interest or industry launched. At present every man is required to possess a qualifying certificate before he can take up land, and it will be just as necessary for a man to hold a qualifying certificate when seeking to enter into a co-operative concern. It is not proposed to squander  &#163;200  or  &#163;300  on every soldier who cares <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make, an application for. the sum. Every business proposition would require to be dealt with on its own merits. From what I have seen! of vocational training, I feel sure that men could be sufficiently equipped to enter into the various businesses which may be established under the principle at stake after only a brief period of training, say, for six months. Businesses to-day are not run solely by business men. Experts are frequently necessary; arid- it would be requisite, in regard to co-operative concerns also, that men df  experience - experts, in factshould be associated with returned soldiers. Every returned man, in whatever business may be established, should understand that&#39; he is. to be regarded as a working partner, and under an obligation to the Government for a. certain proportion of the money laid out, just as sums are being returned to the State Governments to-day with regard to land settlement. I trust the Government will take this opportunity - being one of the best ever provided - of establishing new industries throughout Australia. There is any amount of room and necessity for them. Honorable members need not be afraid of money being lavishly poured out. . The merits and qualifications .of every applicant should be gone into, and I feel confident that there would be far from&#34; a .rush of returned soldiers seeking to be repatriated along these lines. The honorable&#39; member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> referred, to saw-milling plants. These&#39; are not expensive; they * would furnish one avenue for repatriating men at a very much lower cost than by placing them on the land.

          <para>- Those are . the securities of the State Governments, and not pf the Federal authority. There are failures in every avenue of business. Some of our returned men have failed, or will fail, in their efforts upon the land. The fact that there are likely to be a few failures among those who may be set up in co-operative enterprises should not be regarded as an argument against the principle. It should be given a fair trial. Take the proposition of establishing men with saw-milling plants of their own. The Government have contracts for the building of war service homes involving millions of feet of timber. There are&#39;, any number of  men  who are quite capable of .starting themselves successfully with saw-milling plants in various parts of the country. - In my &#34;own. district&#34; there are returned soldiers working in mills fo&#34;r other parties&#39;, who could be just a&#39;s well making profits for themselves along the same lines.

          <para>- I say that; judging by. remarks which I have heard this afternoon. There are more than 300,000 returned men in Australia. If the proposal in its present form is to bp applicable to every one of those men - and&#62; if it were not I would not be prepared to support it - then, undoubtedly there will be many millions involved. I know of ho reason why a returned soldier should be enabled to come under a scheme such as this merely because he proposes to start a woollen mill in some decaying Victorian town which, itself, could not launch an industry of the same character without assistance from public money. It hasbeen stated, during the course of debate, that there are numbers of decaying towns, and that if only industries were started, by individuals - no doubt, with more money than sense - it would be a good thing for those towns. My translation of the pleas of honorable members may be a free one, but that is the tenor of several of the arguments advanced.

            <para>- It is evident that I must have been dreaming when. I thought that the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> made his statement since the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> moved his .alternative amendment. . Whether we should provide . &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;20,000,000 to give effect to the proposal of the honorable member for Capricornia does not concern me at the present mo- ment. If .1 may express my views on the amendment now before the Committee, I should like to say that if we can raise &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;20,000,000- r and no honorable member has so far given us the slightest indication as to how that money is to be raised - we could, in my judgment, spend it better in the interests of the returned soldiers, and that should be our first consideration, by extending the privileges of vocational training to all returned men than by trying, under the amendment, to revive decaying towns in country districts. For one returned soldier who desires to embark upon a cooperative enterprise in a remote country district, there are thousands who desire to be permitted to improve their condition by learning a trade. In my correspondence to-day I have had more than one or two complaints from returned men who have been denied vocational training because they were a few weeks or a few months over twenty years of age when they enlisted. Whilst, because of an arbitrary regulation of the Repatriation Department, we refuse young men this opportunity to improve upon the position which they occupied before they went to the war, it is suggested that we should  spend millions of public money on wildcat schemes for the establishment of industries. In my opinion, the proposal is an ill-considered one, and the Government would be well advised if they refused to accept either of the amendments&#39;  until further consideration is given to the question of extending the advantages of vocational training and of giving men an opportunity to enter into business on their own account. </para>

        <para>Dozens of cases have come under my notice of men having been refused assistance&#39; to establish themselves in businesses because they were notengaged in those businesses before they went to the war. I am perfectly certain, if honorable members are really considering the interests of the returned soldiers, that we could spend this money, if they can show us how the Government are to raise it, to much better advantage by allowing the individual soldier to go his own way in establishing a business,or in learning a new trade under the vocational training provisions, than by embarking upon the ill-considered and immatured schemes involved in the amendments before the Committee. </para>

          <para>.- I rise to offer a suggestion to the Committee. There is. an excellent opportunity here for honorable members to give a practical illustration of their faith in the principle of co-operation. I am perfectly certain that honorable members of each of the parties in this House have the interests of returned soldiers at heart, and desire at the same time to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied also that honorable members are all interested in the establishment of new industries wherever practicable and possible. I should like to say that, although I&#39; do not believe that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> is infallible, I do believe that he has genuinely the interests of the returned soldiers at heart; he has more experience of the practical work of repatriation than any other man; and I have always found him to be a keen, practical business man. My suggestion is that a representative of each party in this House should meet the Minister for Repatriation, and discuss with him the whole question of co-operation for the benefit of returned soldiers. They might see whether, in co-operation with the Minister, it would not be possible to formulate a scheme that would find acceptance at the hands of every member of this Committee. I do not see why that should not be possible. If that suggestion is not adopted, I must say that I am strongly in favour of the alternative amendment proposed by the honor able member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> I have little faith in the success of co-operative ventures controlled by inexperienced men, and in the interests of the Commonwealth, if a proposal of this kind is to be adopted, some guarantee of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the co-operators to be assisted should be required, and they might well be asked to put down &#163;1 for every &#163;1 advanced tothem by the Government. </para>

But I, nevertheless,wish to emphasize the suggestion which I have already made. The question is an exceedingly important one, because there are great possibilities for good in the cooperative movement.

            <para>- The Minister is to have power to approve or disapprove of the establishment of industries on a cooperative basis. The amendment does riot provide that he must grant the requisite assistance. If the Commission is to be worth anything, if it is not intended merely to provide billets  for  . a few men, it should be endowed with&#39; all the powers with which it is now sought to clothe it. If it is to be a useful body it will need to be absolutely independent of political control. I voted as I did last Friday because I considered that if it is to be a plenary Commission, it should be vested with all these powers, whilst if it is not to be a plenary Commission it will riot be worth much. Before I conclude, I would like to deal with a few of the matters mentioned -by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> in the comparison which he instituted between the settlement of our returned soldiers upon the land and the points raised by the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill).</inline> I was rather astonished to hear him preface his remarks with the confession that, to a considerable extent, the attempted settlement of our soldiers upon the land had been a failure. He then went on to suggest that the adoption of any proposal based upon similar lines would only bo inviting failure. But those of our returned soldiers who desire to settle upon the land number only a few thousands, whilst those who wish &#39;to engage in other occupations number hundreds of thousands. There should be no invidious distinction drawn between these two classes. The returned soldiers of New South Wales are allowed to purchase land up to a value of &#163;3,000, and there is no denying that this fact has considerably enhanced the value of farm properties in that State. At first, an applicant was required to deposit 6 per cent, upon the total value of his purchase before he was permitted to secure the land. But some fifteen or eighteen months ago the Minister for Lands in New South Wales abrogated that provision, so that to-day the&#39; whole amount is advanced &#39; to the soldier to enable him to purchase his land. In addition, he is entitled to a grant of &#163;625 to enable him to secure a house, stock, and implements. It is well known that in the great majority of cases the land upon which soldiers have been settled in New South Wales has been considerably over-valued. The local Repatriation Committees have regarded the claims of our- soldier applicants with more favour than &#39;they .would have done under normal conditions. As a result men have been ..settled upon land which is not worth by. hundreds .of pounds the money that has been paid for it. Of course} that is no argument in favour of making&#39; a worse deal. </para>

            <para>- A large portion of it has. In several instances big estates have been purchased by the .Government at exorbitant prices. These estates have been subdivided for the purpose of soldier settlement. Before the men have entered into possession of their blocks, the Minister himself has admitted that the land has been purchased at too high a price, and has reduced the valuation of it to the soldier purchasers. In that way a dead loss of &#163;3 or &#163;4 per acre has been sustained by the State. There is one settlement, of which I have some knowledge, which is to be devoted to the cultivation of prune trees. In that case provision has been made that for seven years a certain amount of sustenance will be paid to the soldier settlers until the prune trees come into bearing. In such circumstances it seems only right that soldiers who wish to enter into our secondary industries should receive at least equal, or  approximately equal, assistance in their co-operative efforts. Let. us suppose that a saw-mill is for sale-not a saw-mill which is a &#34;wilderness of machinery,&#34; as we have been told. As a matter of fact, despite the statement of the Minister for. Repatriation to the contrary, a saw-mill is usually distinguished by the comparative absence from it of machinery. I admit that there is often a wilderness of tramways leading into the bush. Let us assume that a sawmill is worth &#163;1,200. </para>

            <para>- I would not advocate the establishment of any secondary industries without adequate security, but I am endeavouring to show that the proposal, as presented by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs),</inline> does not furnish a sufficiently liberal margin for co-operative undertakings by soldiers who may desire to enter this field of business activity. In connexion with the establishment of saw-mills, I have in mind a case, which came under my own observation, of three soldiers who were able to muster about &#163;200 or &#163;300 between them, but could not purchase outright, as they were unable to find a deposit equal to half the value of the mill, which was about &#163;1,200. I am satisfied from my own experience of these men that the venture was a thoroughly profitable proposition, and would have given a return of about &#163;5 per day. I believe the margin of security should be such as to enable men to engage in co-operative undertakings of this nature, and carry them through successfully, without being worried by the fact that their working capital is hopelessly inadequate. The original proposal will provide this safeguard for the soldier. The honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> has told us that his only wish is to consult the soldiers&#39; interests. But if I understood the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> aright, the purpose of the new Tariff is to decentralize industry. I do not know of any proposition calculated to do this more effectively than the proposal submitted by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill).</inline> There is another phase of the question with which I should like to deal. This scheme will permit of returned soldiers engaging in occupations of a nature different from those with whichthey were associated prior to the war. Under the present repatriation scheme the men have only the right to apply for assistance if they wish to engage in a business with which they were connected prior to enlistment. Every country member can give instances of men whose earlier business undertakings were not remarkably successful, and who only found their real avocation during the war. I know of many men, formerly blacksmiths and engineers, who, since their return, have become very successful saw-mill owners. From a business point of view they have never looked hack. These men did not find their real job until the multifarious activities of the war disclosed their capabilities. Theyhave come back, and it is now only fair that Government assistance should be available to enable them to undertake those business enterprises which are more attractive to them, and for which they may be more fitted. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">If there is one blot on the Repatriation Act it is the provision that even individual men are not eligible for positions which they did not fill priorto the war. I know of one man who had half-finished his tailoring apprenticeship before enlistment, but the Repatriation Department demurred at his request for assistance to become a cutter, so that he could set up in business for himself, the objection being that he was not following his prewar occupation. If the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Echuca is incorporated in the Bill, there will be provision enabling bodies of men to engage in occupations with which, as individuals, they were not connected before the war, and thus a substantial benefit will be conferred upon our returned soldiers and the country. It has been stated that men will be rushing into these co-operative enterprises, but if our soldiers are properly repatriated - I take it that is the desire of this Parliamentit would be remarkable if those who are </para>

The Federal Government will be responsible for the whole of the money required- to repatriate our soldiers, and for land settlement schemes the amount will work out at at least &#163;2,000 per settler, whereas the sum required under the proposal submitted by . the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> will not be more than &#163;250 per head. To put it in other words, we advance the man on the land ten  times as much as it is suggested will be enough for men to start in these industries. It is only advanced, and the security in one case is just as good as- in the other. The honorable member for Capricornia referred to the unemployment trouble and land settlement; but I am prepared to guarantee that as large a number of men will be successfulin co-operative  concerns as in&#34; agricultural pursuits. </para>

            <para>- I have visited factories in company with other honorable members, and have seen rolls of honour unveiled which showed that seventy or eighty men, of a total number of 250 enlisted, were employed in one factory. The honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> will support my statement when I say that in distributing medals at Geelong it was found that thirty-two or thirty-three members of a union, with a total membership of 142, enlisted for active service, while a number of others were called up for home service, and many others volunteered but were rejected, and others were over age. These men are debarred from taking up land because they have been working on the wharfs all their lives, as also are others who have been engaged in woollen mills, boot factories, tanneries, and similar industries. </para>

            <para>- No, but it shows that success has been achieved from a small beginning: We desire to make a start in this direction by inserting a provision in the War Gratuity Bill to enable men to become interested in co-operative concerns. What did the honorable member for </para>

        <para>Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> and the honorablemember for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blundell)</inline> propose? That certain persons who were entitled to the war gratuity should be paid in cash to enable them to start in business on their own account. I know it was their ownmoney that was to be used in financing an undertaking, but that is no reason why a similar provision should not be included in this measure. At Geelong a movement is on foot to open co-operative woollen mills, and I believe that there is as good a prospect of the men who are to engage in that industry being successful as many of those who are taking up land. What did we do when the War Service Homes Bill was before us? Provision was made whereby nurses could receive an advance from the Repatriation Department to start nursing establishments, and, speaking from memory, I think every member of the House supported the proposal. Apparently it is the intention of the Government that nurses and men who will go on the land are to be more favoured than men who have been engaged in industries. Why should we not give those who have been overseas to fight for us the opportunity of engaging in business on their own account? </para>

        <para>Some of the industries mentioned are comparatively easy to establish. I do not suppose there is one boot factory in Australia that owns 50 per cent, of the machinery employed, as a man who has a reasonable chance of making a success of boot manufacturing merely has to approach the manufacturers or suppliers of plant, who will install the necessary machinery. Most ofthe large boot manufacturing concerns in Australia commence in that way, and of the 12,000,000 pairs of boots produced annually in the Commonwealth I suppose quite 11,500,000 , pairs are manufactured in establishments that have machines from the Shoe Machinery Trust. If a man were anxious to start in the saw-milling business, and he approached the repatriation authorities, the first question he would be asked would be, &#34;Were you in the business before ?&#34; If he had not, been he would be an outcast, and would not have an opportunity of engaging in such a business on his own account. </para>

            <para>- If the industries are to be started on a co-operative basis, it certainly does, and I was merely referring to the fact that one of the most successful co-operative concerns in the world was started in a very small way. Under this Bill we are endeavouring to establish a new principle by advancing money to enable men to engage in business. It has been generally recognised that it is the duty of the Government to assist men who were away from their trade or calling for three or four years, and, as the  Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> has stated, Australia has done more than any other country in the way of reestablishing menin civil life. Although we may have done much, I am now asking that men who were engaged in industries before going abroad should be given similar opportunities &#39;to those who were engaged, in rural pursuits. We have been reminded of the industrial unrest in the community by the honorable member for. Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Robert Cook),</inline> who has said that if provision were made for the establishment of co-operative concerns many of our present industrial disputes could be avoided&#39;, as men would be employed in. establishments of their own. It has been said by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that if the proposed new clause was embodied in the Bill it wouldbe the means of unsettling men who are already engaged in other occupations. I believe that 60 per cent, of the returned soldiers who have been discharged have never approached the repatriation authorities for assistance, but have gone back to the occupations they previously followed in factories, tanneries, or woollenmills, and many other industries in town, as well as in the country. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. Whoever was responsible for administering the Act would, if this co-operative scheme were adopted, make sure that the Government had sufficient security, which in many cases would be as good an asset as land. The Government arenot prepared to advance, say, &#163;250 each to a number of men whoknow something of the sawmilling business, and all the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca provides is that they shall be given the opportunity, if the Minister approves. The honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> has teen fighting for a long time in the interests of returned soldiers in connexion with theAnzac tweed industry, andI trust that the movement may be assisted by the adoption of this provision. I trust that the proposal that the Government should advance &#163;1 for &#163;1, will not be considered. The Government are prepared to advance &#163;2,500, plus &#163;650 for building and machinery, for men who go on the land, but, apparently, they are not anxious to assist others. The Government consider that in such cases they have the land as security, but, as the honorable member for Echuca and other members of the Country party have stated, there are in many instances grave doubts as to whether the land is worth the price, paid. We know, that in the Devon Meadows Estate land which was sold at &#163;30 per acre has proved absolutely valueless for farming purposes. </para>

        <para>In connexion with the vocational training scheme, I believe that although a number of trainees have completed their course in certain trades, not a single man has been called up. Eight months ago I visited the Working Men&#39;s College, where men were engaged in electroplating, but I do not think the plant is there to-day. It would be far better to allow men to engage in work in which they were directly interested than to spend money in training them when the training is of no use to them. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. mackay</inline>(Lilley) &#91;S.30&#93; . - I hope that as a result of this debate the Government will give its approval to the principle of co-operation. I am thoroughly in sympathy with the proposal that the soldiers, shall be accorded an opportunity to co-operate. Co-operation, in my opinion, would benefit them, as it would benefit many other sections of the community. We all know the progress that the dairying industry has made in consequence of co-operative effort.  But, as tile honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster)</inline> has shown, the clause to which the Senate objects, which was adopted at the instance of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> is crudely drawn and incomplete, because it contains no provision for the guidance of the Minister or of the Commission. In my view, the principle which it would put into elect deserves a Bill to itself, and I hope that the Government will definitely promise, to bring in a Bill almost immediately to carry out the object aimed at by the honorable member for Echuca. I regret that the clause, as it stand&#39;s, is incomplete, and that its adoption would lead to a great deal of confusion.- It is often impossible to get two men to agree, even on a very ordinary mattery yet no provision is made for settling any disagreement. The object of the honorable member for Echuca could, however, be properly carried into effect by means of a Bill containing  ample provision for the settling of any difficulties that might arise. Failing the promise of such a measure, I shall .support the proposal of th&#169; honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> . </para>

            <para>- i do not think that they appeal to many honorable members. Even if the clause under discussion is incomplete, it must not be forgotten that the Bill provides for the making of regulations by which the difficulties alluded to by the &#39;honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mackay)</inline> may be removed. Some of the best men who went to the war - one of them was a winner -of the &#34;Victoria Cross - -were men capable of doing every kind of mill work - in the bush, on the tram, and at the bench. Why should not such men be helped to set up for themselves ? As the honorable member for Cow,per <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> has pointed out, there is room in all parts of  Australia for small co-operative concerns. Cooperation would&#39; be the chief, means of getting rid of many of the difficulties that now exist in the relations of capital and labour.. We have here an opportunity to enable returned soldiers to become their own employers. The honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Richard Foster&#39;)</inline> arid the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> have said that wild-cat proposals would be brought under the clause. But are there not safeguards ? We have appointed - i think, unnecessarily - a Commission of Repatriation, which must indorse every application for assistance. Its indorsement will require the approval of the Minister, which means the approval of the Cabinet, and the Cabinet is responsible to Parliament. There could be rio greater security than is given by that arrangement.  </para>

            <para>- If every proposal for expenditure sanctioned by Parliament had &#39; been surrounded with similar safeguards, there would not have ..been so&#39; much waste in connexion with some of our public works. I do not know of any other proposal for the expenditure of public money which is so well safeguarded. The question we must ask ourselves is: Are returned soldiers who when they enlisted were wages men to be given a chance to co-operate and become their  own employers ? Had the measure come before the House three years ago, when the wax was in progress, not one member would have objected to this proposal; but some members would now say to men who, as soldiers, covered themselves with honour, and acquitted themselves on active service in a way that has never been surpassed: &#34; If when you enlisted you were employed at a mill or in a mine, you must go back to that employment.&#34; We have no right to require that of men who made good. The returned soldiers who took up the weaving of cloth, making what is known as Anzac tweed, have done well, and would have done a great deal better had they been given a fair run; and is there anything that would be more advantageous to the men themselves, or to the country, than the formation of small co-operative concerns by returned soldiers? It is to .the credit of the Government and of Parliament that the returned&#39; man who when he enlisted was a farm labourer has been given a chance to acquire a farm of his own, and it would be unjust if we refused to give like opportunities to men who formerly were mill hands or miners. I ask the Committee to insist on its amendment. The clause to which the Senate objects was agreed to without a division, and no good reason has been given to us for reversing our decision regarding it. It would be absurd to intrust the Minister for Repatriation and the Commission with the expenditure of scores of millions of pound&#39;s in other directions and to say that they cannot be trusted to study the interests of the community in the granting of assistance to cooperative bodies of returned men. </para>

          <para>.- I never thought it would be necessary in any Parliament in Australia to use an argument to defend co-operative effort, or that I would ever hear it said by Government supporters that the man who lives in a town and follows a trade is not fit to be trusted or helped to the same extent as a man on the land. If the Government&#39;s idea is to take men from the cities, I would say to them, &#34; Let . them go into country centres and start co- operative establishments.&#34; If a Minister would go through the Red Cross handweaving factory in Sydney, he would be a better . man for his experience, and would have greater confidence in his fellow men. Only this afternoon I have received samples of the workmanship in that factory. Sworn evidence says that the tweeds turned out here are more than the equal of those which come from Europe. The price is 15s. per yard double width, with an extra charge of ls. 6d. per yard for cloth in which what are known as solid dyes are used. It is made wholly from worsted. If those engaged in the hand-weaving industry in Victoria had had only half, the chance of those who are turning out such fine cloth in Sydney, they would have made their establishment a success also. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Frood  who has contradicted some statements in the report read by the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie)</inline> the other night, has just returned from Sydney saying that he was never more delighted in his life than when he inspected the Sydney factory, where there are fifty men employed, each earning up to &#163;5 5s. a week. They are not treated as the Repatriation Department treated the Melbourne men by deducting their paltry pension from their earnings. </para>

            <para>- The unfortunate laws of Great Britain, which at the time of our visit did not allow a man a vote on the ground that he was a man, permitted men to be sweated under conditions of competition, but there was not an individual working for one of those cooperative concerns who was willing to leave and take work in private firms. I do not think that I can say any more to stress the point, but I would like to know if any Minister would care to resign and fight the Melbourne seat on this question. I am sure that the people outside would say that there must be equality of opportunity to every soldier to make good. If we had the law of recall in operation I would go to the constituency of any honorable member who claims that under the Government proposal equality of opportunity is given, and fight him on the issue. I understand that this question has been thoroughly threshed out, and as one - of  the oldest members of the House, I desire to warn young members that if, merely because they happen &#34;to be followers of the Ministry, they  voto  against the retention of the clause, they will live to regret it. </para>

          <para>.- I am one of those unfortunate individuals to whom the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> has just referred as being likely to get their necks into a cleft, because I intend to vote against the retention- of the clause to which the Senate objects. I am just as keen a supporter of co-operation as is any other honorable member of this House. I have been interested in cooperative enterprises, some of which have ended very disastrously through bad management and the fact that everybody in them wanted to be a boss. I shall give very briefly my reasons for voting against the clause which was inserted in the Bill last week on the motion of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> and with which the Senate has disagreed. My view of it is that it leads to nowhere. If it were carried, any proposal made under it to the Commission would have to go to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> as the final arbiter, and with the Minister in his present frame of mind disappointment would await theapplicants. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have listened with a good deal of interest to the various arguments that have been  adduced  both in favour of and against the clause. It seems to me that the bulk of the suggestions for cooperative effort on the part of returned soldiers have centred round the saw-milling industry and the establishment of woollen mills. Many honorable members during this debate have referred to woollen mills established on a co-operative basis as being likely to give employment to many returned men, and at least one honorable member has said that if the Government would grant to a party of returned soldiers a sum of &#163;250 each, they would be able to embark upon such an enterprise. I propose to quote - and this is my main reason for rising - a few figures which I think will at once remove from the minds of honorable members any idea of a woollen mill being established for such a sum. These figures relate to the cost of the Commonwealth mill at Geelong. Some may say that that mill is thoroughly up to  date - as it undoubtedly is - and offers opportunities for advancement; but we should be prepared to erect only such a mill as would provide for the best conditions for those employed in it, and when we take&#39; into consideration the fact that the cost, of machinery and material has increased considerably since&#34; the Commonwealth mill was erected, it will be seen at once from the figures I intend to quote that any proposal for the establishment of woollen mills by returned soldiers is out of the question. I learn from the Defence Department that the mill buildings alone cost &#163;81,000, while the &#39;cost of machinery was &#163;93,390. The number of employees - and I ask honorable members to follow these- figures closely, since it has been said that the establishment of an industry of this kind  would in a measure solve the returned soldier unemployment problem - on 31st March last was 293. Of these employees, 148 were males and 145 females. The cost of buildings and plant therefore represents &#163;595 per employee. If we divide the cost by the number of male employees, we find that it works out at &#163;1,150 odd per man. It will thus be seen that it would be absolutely impossible for the Government to advance such huge sums of money for the establishment of the industry by men who for the most part would have had no experience. </para>

            <para>- I have referred to a mill where, perhaps, the employees work under better conditions than do those at Ballarat. The returned soldiers in Geelong and the surrounding district recognise that the future of Australia depends, not only upon the primary industries, butalso upon, the secondary industries.They met together, and having, as intelligent men, reasoned the matter out, they put before the soldiers of Victoria a proposition for the establishment of a woollen mill on a co-operative basis in Geelong. The shares held by any one man are limited to five at &#163;20 each, and the majority of soldiers are paying for their shares with their gratuity bonds. </para>

          <para>.- It is most interesting to discover that all the Government supporters, whilst in sympathy with the proposition put forward by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> yet adduce a multiplicity of reasons for not supporting the thing in which they believe. That is the outstanding feature of the debate to-day. We have before us an amendment moved by the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> upon a proposition by the honorable member for Echuca that the Government should give financial assistance to a system of co-operatidn amongst soldiers. I make no professions of sympathy with the soldiers in any shape or form, but, warrior as I am, returned from the Front with all the scars of war upon me - I could say more than could those who have kept far away from the battle line - express my sympathy with them also. But that matter is not under discussion. We are dealing with a proposal that co-operative enterprises for soldiers shall be assisted by the Government. This has been violently opposed by the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> on the ground that it is the most violent&#39; piece of socialistic legislation ever presented to this House. So that no credit or discredit attaches to honorable members on this side; the whole of it belongs to the representative of Echuca, who comes from a farming district to present to us the foundational principles of Socialism. For this reformation, we may be thankful. Finally, a transformation took place, and the Minister accepted what he said was dangerous to this country. It was not that he had become converted to the principle that  earlier had  been  abhorrent to him, but because he found that the numbers were against him. Again, we see how numbers count, and how they dictate principles. The amendment having been carried here, it was sent to another place, and, on the recommendation of a representative of the Government, was turned down. Four grounds for its rejection were given : Firstly, that we could not give to ten men&#62; what was not- being given to one, and therefore we should not give anything to anybody; secondly, that we should not settle any soldiers, because it would unsettle them; thirdly, that we should not support any enterprise, or, indeed, anything at all, because it would probably be unsuccessful. Of course, if it would be unsuccessful, we could not do anything; and therefore the whole scheme of repatriation should go by the board. We should not give a man anything, because if we gave him, say, a horse and cart to carry on his industry, he might be unsuccessful, and the money would be wasted. So why do anything? Fourthly, that, after the principle had been condemned and rejected, if it had any excellence in it at all, the proposal should be embodied in another Bill. Thus the rejected amendment comes back to this Chamber, where the Government moves that it be set aside. Then comes the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> with another amendment, which is a whittling down of the original proposition. The honorable member for Echuca proposed that, instead of soldiers individually receiving ,&#163;500 each for their repatriation, to buy a horse or cart, or start in a business in which they might fail, or to settle on the land, we should be prepared to treat with any number of them as a collective body, and give to them as such a lump sum of money representing the total of what each man could have claimed as  an individual. What does it matter, if we are dealing with half-a-dozen individuals, whether the Government advance &#163;500 to each of them or to say to them as a body : &#34;If you care to engage in any industry or occupation together, the money that should be advanced to you individually will be advanced to you as a corporation? But the Government say &#34;No&#34; to that proposal. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> then proposes that if the Government will not go the whole hog, they shall have power to at . least subsidize .any cooperative enterprise to the extent of &#163;1 for &#163;1 of the amount subscribed by those engaged in it. What do the Government do then? Do they say that they cannot accept that amendment, and the principle it embodies?  Do they denounce it for the four reasons for which another place rejected the major proposition? Not at all. Yet there is no argument against the major proposition which is not equally applicable to the amendment moved by the honorable member for Capricornia. If the original scheme might involve failures, might unsettle men, and might be a waste of funds, and if the principle which the Minister for Repatriation denounced in another place should be embodied in another Bill, on what grounds do the Government consent to embodying in this measure the same principle which they said was an absurdity and would lead to failure? Driven by the force of numbers, and seeing the possibility of whittling away the amendment moved by the honorable member for Echuca, they accept the alternative put forward by the honorable member for Capricornia, and propose to embody in the Bill the same principles and the same objections as led to the rejection of the original amendment. And if the amendment be insisted upon, it ia quite true, as has been said by the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister),</inline> that the Minister will have absolute power to say whether these advances shall or shall not be made. That argument being valid, what harm can the amendment do? Honorable members opposite say that they know the Minister; that they can rely upon him; and that, holding the opinion he does, he would not give any assistance in the terms of this amendment. If that be true, not only the amendment, but the original proposition, may be accepted with safety, for the reason that the Minister might make it a dead letter. What, then, is the objection, to the amendment? </para>

            <para>-Who will create the disappointment and delay but . the nian who has the administration of the Act? As has already been said, if this proposal is incorporated in the Bill, and a Minister dares to repudiate the .decision of Par-  liament, the responsibility will rest on him; Parliament at least will have done its duty. We have heard much about the fear of non-success under a clause such as that proposed, but if we had judged all repatriation cases on their merits and asked whether each was likely to be a success or not, repatriation would not have been advanced at all, for probably thousands would have been judged on the possibility of non-success.&#34; The money for repatriation has been advanced, I take it, on the ground of justice. Hundreds of men have, unfortunately, been unsuccessful in their enterprises, but, on the other band, thousands have been successful. It may be quite true .that under this new clause a few would be unsuccessful, but some good would be achieved, at least, if a certain section of the men were successful, and a number of industries established throughout the country, with the workers, as proprietors and shareholders, bound to do part of the work and to carry part of the responsibility. That, in itself, would demonstrate to every man that he was not merely a workman drawing wages paid by another, but that he could exist by his own enterprise, activity, and thrift. It would, I repeat, be good work to develop a class of men capable of carrying on their own businesses. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>However, the whole position is largely farcical. Even if it were likely, as has been said, that the Minister for Repatriation would make the clause a dead letter, I cannot see why the Government cannot accept it now. There is no stronger condemnation of the Government than its present absurd position. I could have understood the Government saying that they could not accept the proposal, but it is surely ignominious on their part, after saying they could not accept one proposal, to accept another, the same in principle, and against which the same arguments can be applied. I propose to vote for the retention of the new clause agreed to before on the motion of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> but I do this with no ill feeling against the Government. At this crisis, in view of the advent of a very important immigrant whom we are to presently welcome to our shores, I do not wish to offend or embarrass the. Government in any way; the idea of a double dissolution is disconcertingeven to me.. But, surely, in spite of the coming of  His  Royal Highness ..the </para>
        <para class="block">Prince of Wales, and the risk of the loss of their salaried positions, the Government might, for one night at least, stand on some ground of principle - not permanently, but just for a little while. An honorable member near me suggests that the principle of L.S.D. is the most important one; and I cannot ask the Government to cast such a principle to the winds. I would not do so myself; but, at the same time, I think the Government, in their own interest, ought to take some solid stand. If the Government objected to the clause and the amendment on the self-same grounds - &#39;that, if either were carried into effect, it would unsettle people, would be likely to prove unsatisfactory, and that this is not the measure in which to embody a principle of this character - any man could understand the position, though he might not agree with them. For my part, I shall vote for the new clause, but without any great hope that the Government will be overthrown. </para>

          <para>. -  I am sorry that the one &#34;baa lamb,&#34; which promised to be of some use in repatriation, should have been shorn of the short wool it had when it first left this House. Why do the Government object, to this proposal, and why are the returned soldiers on the Government side going to vote against it? Have they been &#34;nobbled,&#34; or do they still desire to go about the&#39; country howling that every man should be sacked from his position who did not go to the war? Are they still going to say that old men should be put out of positions they have occupied for years in favour of returned men- old men whose sons went to the Front, while others were put in their jobs at home? Or will they, on the other hand, seek to repatriate our men in a civilized way? If the latter, an opportunity is now presented. The other day the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr)</inline> moved the adjournment of the House in order to request that some girls should be sacked in Sydney, and returned soldiers put in their places; and on that occasion the Government explained the whole position away. Their proposal was that all skulkers, even if they could not pass the examinations to entitle them to go to the .Front, should be discharged, and returned soldiers put in their places. We now have proposed a comprehensive system* of employing  soldiers without putting girls and old and invalid men out of work. Do the returned soldiers opposite desire to find work for returned soldiers? Do they believe that it is fair to place a &#34; digger &#34; on the land, and give him a chance to make good, and refuse a man in the city a similar chance? One of the most surprising arguments was used by the honorable member for Grampians . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett),</inline> who had the infernal impudence to suggest that no soldier in the city should be able to avail himself of such a clause as this. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member would compel a man to go to the country whether he liked to do so or not, or forfeit his right to any assistance. The returned men opposite know as well as I do that thousands of men returned from the Front utterly unfitted for their previous occupations, and some of them have been receiving sustenance allowance for eight or nine months. . This, is wasted money, which makes these men loafers by force. The principal objection by the Government is that if money is advanced in the way proposed the men will waste it; but they are willing to accept the proposal of the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs).</inline> The Government say that if the men come along, and give &#34; quid &#34; for &#34;quid,&#34; they will be helped; but we know that the men have not the money to accept such an offer. </para>

            <para>- Of course. We know that many of the returned men have shown no disposition to work; but that is not to be wondered at. They were away three or four .years from any civilian work; and yet they are asked to settle down in their old places, be good boys, and do as much as they did before. I would like to see some honorable, members&#39; put back to their old jobs, and watch how they settle down to them again. I know that I am not hankering after mine. The Government have been shown advanced methods and systems for repatriating  great  bodies of men, but they have refused to take advantage of most of those opportunities. If returned soldiers in this Chamber do not support the principle introduced by the Country party, I&#34; warn them that every time they ask for a man to be put out of a place so that a returned soldier may fill it I shall tell them they are trying to. punish those who did not go to the war, and that it is only another form of economic conscription. They must know that if they succeed in getting returned soldiers out of the ordinary labour market into some new avenue of employment it will be leaving positions open for those who did not fight, and those jobs are what a lot of people are looking for. There are mothers and fathers in Australia whose sons did not enlist, and who insist that the latter shall not be penalized/ The time will come when returned soldiers will be in the minority ; and they cannot expect a fair deal then if they do not make clear now that they do not want to create positions for returned men at the expense of those who cannot be so classed. Many men before the war were working in uncongenial surroundings, and for comparatively little pay. They want something better now. They went away to fight; they fought the battles of the capitalists, and the least that their returned soldier representatives in Parliament should do now is to see that they get decent opportunities. The Government have a chance to bring about a true and broad form of repatriation. </para>

            <para>- I must appeal to the Chair for protection against these interjections. I was much impressed by the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner. It appears to me that he suggested a fair compromise to overcome the difficulty in which we find ourselves. A number of our members are travelling to-night in the train, and. will be here to-morrow, and it is clear that the Committee is very nearly equally divided on this question. We are all anxious to do the best we can for the returned soldiers. The amendment I wish to move is not my own, but. is, as I have said, the suggestion of the honorable  member  for Fawkner, that a member of each party in this House should consult with the Minister for Repatriation and frame a clause for insertion in this Bill to assist in the repatriation of returned soldiers under the co-operative system which would meet with the approval of honorable members generally. Will the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> stand up to such a proposal, because I have no desire to steal his thunder ? If he is prepared to carry out the intention which he has already expressed, I 3hall  not move in that direction. His suggestion, I think, is a fair one, and one which the Government should accept. </para>

          <para>.- It was because several amendments were before the Committee that, earlier in the day, I was induced to suggest that they should be left in abeyance, and that meanwhile a representative of each party in this Chamber should consult with the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> for the purpose of formulating some scheme of co-operation which would achieve the end we all have in view -  namely, that pf advancing the interests of our returned soldiers.

            <para>- Of course, any addition to the amendment of the honorable member for Capricornia may be made. The Government are very &#34; cocky &#34; just now. A bridge has been built for them by an honorable member which allowed them to escape from an awkward dilemma. It is by no means the first bridge of the kind that has been constructed, and it will not be tFe last. </para>

The principle enunciated in the proposal put. forward by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> was a definite one.  Personally, I have already objected to differential treatment as between those soldiers who settle upon the land and those who follow factory occupations, in which they are not finding the new industrial world of which we have heard so much. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of this addition is not to place any returned soldier, as has been most improperly suggested, at a disadvantage as compared with any other returned soldier. My object is rather to assist in the establishment of industries such as are mentioned in clause 47a in country districts and country towns. If the amendment be adopted, not a single soldier will be debarred from taking part in such industries. A most improper attempt has been made to persuade honorable members that some discrimination is suggested in favour of soldiers resident in country towns. The whole object of the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> and of this amendment is to enable every returned soldier to take advantage of co-operative enterprises. Believing as I do that if these industries are established in country towns and dis- tricts  they will assist our soldiers very much more than would otherwise be the case, I desire to see the Bill altered in that direction. </para>

            <para>- But everybody does not heed it. The honorable member for Wakefield knows of this drift, but is he so acting as to check it ? . I wish to impress upon honorable members the fact that in two States of the Commonwealth - Victoria &#39; and South Australia - the population of the capital cities is greater than that in the whole of the remainder of these States. In Victoria the population of Melbourne is 723,000 and&#39; in the rest of the State only 707,000; and in South Australia, the population of Adelaide in 1918 was .235,000, as compared with 210,000 in the rest of the State.  This deplorable drift of population has reached such aggravated proportions that it is now almost impossible to find houses&#39; in the cities. If we pro- . vide employment for people in the country districts, we can, at all events, insure^ sufficient houses for their accommodation. </para>

            <para>- At all events, the amendment, if adopted, will have the effect- of preventing houses <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> being pulled down in country towns and transported to the metropolitan areas. The problem of overcrowding in our principal cities has now reached a most acute stage. We have been told over and over again, and every honorable member knows it is true, that if the father or mother, of a family desires to find house accommodation in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, one of the first questions asked of them is whether they have any children or not. In a large number of cases, if they have children, they are unable to get a house. Nohonorable member can point to one country town in Australia where a similar question is asked. Every one knows that everything possible should be done to arrest this drift of population. The problem should bo tackled, not only on general principles, but in detail, and so far as I am concerned any Bill containing a provision that will have the effect of dragging population away from the country to the cities will meet with my strongest opposition. </para>

I think the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> had betterretreat, for the simple reason that on this occasion he is going to be defeated. Great as is my objection to the Government, and anxiety to displace them, I am certainly not going to follow the honorable member for Grampians on this occasion, because he seeks to put a limitation upon the operation of the amendment so that, even if it were carried, it would be valueless. </para>

            <para>- Of course! That is what we are here for. Our business is to talk. The work is not done here, but elsewhere. If the original proposal had any good in it at all, it would have been wrong to limit its operation to any part of the country, or any part of Australia. In order to buttress his position, the honorable member for Grampians makes an allegation that the policy of Governments in the past has had the effect of dragging population away from country districts, and he contends that the position will be restored by , the encouragement of these co-operative enterprises in country districts only. But, so far as Victoria is concerned, his argument is of no value. The trend of population in Victoria towards the cities is due; in part, to the decay of the mining industry. </para>

The decay of mining in this State has left desolate large areas of land which arenot fit for agricultural operations. </para>

            <para>- And that disposes of. the argument used by the honorable member for Grampians. It does not disprove what I said. Small as the Country party is, it seems to be divided on great questions. In any case, apart from Ballarat and its population, we have not merely to deal with such places, and say that the country is dead, and that the cities are drawing away thousands of men. It is a question of the country being developed on a larger scale, and machinery being employed for agricultural purposes. In the Wimmera and Western districts, for instance, there is a smaller population to-day than there was thirty or forty years ago. </para>

            <para>- Yes. It is one of the factors that have to be considered, and I do not wish to occupy time by referring to other States, but to confine my remarks to Victoria, where, in the Western District, those on the land have given up farming to engage in sheep raising. The Wimmera district is also an illustration, and the statistics of the municipalities show there has been a gradual decline in the population, and that where ten or twelve farms existed, only one now remains. Through a process of absorption, adjoining properties have been acquired, and larger areas have been worked with the aid of machinery to enable wheatgrowing to be undertaken more successfully. In the district represented by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wise)</inline> the small holdings of forty years ago were being worked as pastoral propositions, but they are now coming back into small holdings under the Closer Settlement Act. Why do manufacturers congregate in cities where men are packed together when they can go out into country districts where, in many instances, they find the workmen disorganized, receiving lower wages, and working longer hours? Is it not all- a question of water supply and motive power, the transportation of coal, and the handling of their products? These are factors which all manufacturers consider in connexion with country districts. One farmer buys out another until he has a larger area under control, when he employs machinery to do the work, and the men who were employed on farms drift towards the city and make machinery used by the man working the larger holding. The population drifts from one place to another, and it is the economic result of the conditions under which we live. The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has moved an amendment, and I agree with the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> that there is very little in it. What does the amendment as originally submitted or as amended by the honorable member for Grampians really mean? If the statement of the honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lister)</inline> is true, the Minister will have the power, if he so desires, to be hostile. The amendment of the honorable member for Grampians places too much power in the Minister&#39;s hands. For instance, it may be said that an industry to be established in Toorak or St. </para>

        </continue>
        <para class="block">Kilda is likely to be profitable, although it may be unreasonable to advance, say, &#163;10,000 of public money in a country district. It is giving the Minister power to say whether a particular industry should or should not be established in a country district. If there were a dozen men willing to subscribe pound for pound, and a business could be successfully carried on in Melbourne, and not in the country, the Minister would be prevented from giving approval. I certainly cannot support the amendment of the honorable member for Grampians, and I think he will be well advised to withdraw it, and allow the original proposition to stand. </para>

          <para>.- I have listened with interest to the dissertation of the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> regarding the congregation in big centres, and the only thing that is wrong with the statement of the honorable member is that it is not quite true. He has given reasons why manufactures and population congregate in the cities, but what are the facts? Why do our principal cities increase in size? I know that the circumstances credited to Melbourne by the honorable member do not apply to Sydney. Why has Sydney increased  in size? During the whole period of responsible government in New South Wales up till 1913, five-sixths of the money borrowed in that State, with the exclusion of that spent on railway work, was spent in and around Sydney for local purposes, which should have been undertaken by a Greater Sydney. Manufacturers congregate there because it is not made profitable to haul coal to the country where the raw material is, and because differential railway rates are imposed on&#39; a railway system designed to kill secondary industries in the country. I do not know what has happened in Victoria, but that is the experience of New South Wales, and great cities have grown up in consequence of the disproportionate amount of public money that has been spent. We have been told that in England, France, Germany, and the United States of America, in the interests of the nations as a whole, manufactories are being decentralized, and this is being done largely because electric power is now able to be cheaply transmitted to outside centres. As the Minister for Trade  and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> said when introducing the. Tariff, there is no reason why manufacturers here should congregate in the large cities, where workmen have to grow up with dirt and coaldust in their lungs, and, in consequence, rear children who are physically unfit. There is no reason, under modern conditions, why industries should not be established where the raw products exist so that men could live in decent homes and in comfortable surroundings. If men are allowed to work in country districts with attractive surroundings, we shall be able to rear men possessing the best characteristics of our Australian soldiers, and, in the next war, we shall not have men such as those who came from crowded centres like Shoreditch - men whose chest you could span with two fingers, though their spirit was indomitable. Our desire is to benefit not merely our returned soldiers by &#39;assisting them to conduct secondary industries with co-operative effort, but to benefit also the neighbourhoods in which those industries will be established by bringing to them the comforts which now attract our population to the cities. At the present time there is hardly a country town in New South &#34;Wales that possesses modern conveniences. Towns likeInverell, Lismore, and Grafton, which are surrounded by prosperous districts having a production almost equalling that of Victoria, have hardly increased in size in twenty-five years, because no secondary industries are established there. I hope that the Committee will take advantage of this opportunity to make a practical step towards decentralization. We have decentralization leagues everywhere. A Victorian league was &#39; reported as meeting in Melbourne only on Saturday last, and there is now ari opportunity to give effect to decentralization. The establishment of . secondary industries in country towns will be practical decentralization. .It will improve the lot of every farmer within 10 miles of them, by increasing his local market, by making cheap power available, and by enabling him to live under better conditions.- There is bound to be an&#39; aggregation of holdings resulting in big estates where produce cannot find a local sale, or easy .access to distant markets, but where, as on the T.weed, facili- ties for transport are increased, or a local market is given, land will be cut up into small holdings, because men find that they can make a living on such holdings. I trust that honorable members will not be swayed by local prejudice and parochial feeling, but will take this opportunity of giving a national direction to the industrial life of this Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>.  -  I am now able to make those comments on the proposal of the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> which I could not make earlier in the discussion, and I am glad that my speech has been deferred, because the position now is clearer than when I sought to address the Committee before. The soldier, it appears, is unwilling to go into those places where the honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and the honorable member for Grampians wish- to put him, and therefore he is to be compelled to go there. He is to be denied the assistance which a little while ago we were told would be the salvation of unemployed men, unless he is prepared to pursue his industry in the decaying country towns of Victoria. We have been told that it is the long hours, the low wages, the hard conditions of country life, coupled with high freights and other disadvantages, that drive the people into our cities, and yet the honorable member for Grampians would force the soldier to accept those hard conditions or forego the assistance of the Government. The object of the proposal is to build up the decaying towns of Victoria, and the soldier is to undertake this work. I object to that. Out repatriation efforts should study first the interests of the soldier. If he wants to go to country towns, by all means let us help him to do so, but if he does not, he has the same right to assistance in a city occupation as he would have to assistance in a country occupation. Those who talk about the need for populating the country districts do not live in the country; they live in the city. The farmers, too, when they have &#34;done their bit,&#34; and are able to retire, come to the cities; and one of the causes of the decay&#34; of the farming industry is that so many farmers have become city-dwelling landlords. 1 </para>

The honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anstey)</inline> hae accurately described the causes which draw men from the country to the city. They are not to he overcome by any such proposal as that now before us.  The future of the dwellers in cities is to be secured by improving sanitation, abolishing slums, and making the cities habitable, so that the physique of . their people may be as good as that of the young men whom we sent to the war. If cooperation is to succeed, the soldier must be able to decide where he will follow the industry that he chooses; he cannot be compelled to practise it only in the country towns. </para>

          <para>. -r-I desire to direct the attention of the Government to the congestion in the Arbitration Court. A statement has been presented to honorable members detailing forty-two cases still to be heard by the Court, although some of them were initiated- as far back aa 1918. This matter is entirely apart from the phase of the question mentioned this afternoon by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> relative to the amendment of the Act, which will have to he seriously considered by the House. In my opinion the congestion ought to be relieved by the appointment of additional Justices, or perhaps, if some of the other Justices could take a few of the cases, it might enable the unions to get their cases heard. It is no wonder there is industrial unrest, seeing that those who wish to comply with the industrial law are prevented from getting a decision. </para>

          <para>. -  I would like to know whether the Government intend to proceed with the Judiciary Bill before the adjournment, because it is my intention to move for the insertion of the clause extending the moratorium for twelve months. This is rather a pressing matter throughout Australia, and if it is not the intention of the Government to bring forward the Judiciary Bill I shall have to adopt some other means of achieving the same object. </para>

        <para>I agree that something will need to be done soon to relieve the industrial arbitration congestion, or we had better give up the ghost. The fundamental basic reason for these delays is that we have not an arbitration Court, but a law Court. Instead of the Court giving decisions by and large, and adjudging what is a fair thing as between arbitrators, matters are argued as if lives were at stake. Something will need to be done to simplify the procedure and enable cases to be dealt with much more speedily. The Government are not losing sight of the congestion, and&#39; I hope something will soon be dope to try to relieve it. I understand the main trouble is that we have not enough Justices to undertake the work, and if the Court is to continue,I dare say it will be necessary to appoint some more. </para>
