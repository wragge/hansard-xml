          <para>The motion to which the honorable member refers has been given precedence, not at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, or of the Government, or of any honorable member, but simply in accordance with invariable parliamentary custom in Great Britain, and which has certainly been - whenever such occasions have arisen - the practice of this House since its first meeting. </para>

        <para class="block">When a notice of motion of censure or of no-confidence is given by the Leader of the Opposition, or with his concurrence or sanction, it is the practice to place it first on the business-paper  for  the following day, but such a motion by a private member without the sanction of the Leader of the Opposition would be treated like any other notice of motion in arranging the business-paper. What has been done on this occasion is in accordance with established custom. </para>

              <para>- Under the Standing Orders, only a brief time is allowed me for placing this matter before the House, and I have the right to expect that the members of the Opposition, who particularly claim to represent the working classes, will allow me to speak without interruption. It is known to them, and to all who take an interest in the industrial welfare of the country, that there is the gravest reason to apprehend industrial trouble in the near future, unless prompt steps be taken to provide means . for settling disputes without resort to strikes. The history of the coal-mining industry is full of warnings. I have  always&#39; been, as- 1 am now, a firm believer in the wisdom of settling industrial troubles before they have advanced to a stage at which they are beyond control. As every trade unionist knows the majority of industrial troubles are due to the failure of the parties to- </para>

              <para>- Some of the most serious disputes that have occurred in the Commonwealth of late have been due to the natural and justifiable feeling of trade unionists that the Arbitration Court does not afford&#39; that speedy means of settling disputes thatwas intended when the Court was set up. I do not blame the Justices of the Court for this, because I recognise the difficulties under which they labour on account of the limitation of their powers by the Constitution. As we have- failed to secure from the people the right to extend the powers of the Col,rt. it seems to, me that those- who seek to- promote industrial peace must now look for some other means of settling disputes. </para>

              <para>- It will be remembered that a, special tribunal was set up to deal with disputes in the coa&#62;lmining industry in 1915. Every one who regards the results of that departure from established custom must admit that it was for the benefit of the whole of the people of this country. On. a subsequent date, when the then Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> intervened in similar circumstances with a view to preventing Australia being thrown into the turmoil of a great industrial dispute during the war, there were considerable criticisms of his action; but I think time has shown that he did a service to the Commonwealth. I am not so much concerned with the methods by which these things  are done  as with the results achieved when they are done. I stand by the action that the then Acting Prime Minister took when he met the miners in conference and settled that dispute, and so prevented others from being diverted from the work of prosecuting the war, which was then of supreme importance. </para>

          <para>To-day we see on every hand evidence that, unless some such effective action is taken by the Government, outside of any action which is possible to .the Arbitration Court in the present congested state of its business, and with its- limited powers, this country may at any day be plunged into another of those great industrial upheavals which cost the people such immense sums of money. It is impossible to overestimate the losses to the working people of the Commonwealth due to industrial troubles that could have been cured had they been taken in hand at the proper time and in the proper way. Speaking with a long experience of these matters, I say it is the imperative duty of the Government immediately to take such steps as will enable the disaffected coal miners to place their case before an independent tribunal which has power to take the . steps necessary to effect a just and reasonable settlement of the questions at issue between the parties. </para>
          <para>I am reluctant to discuss the matter as it affects the Arbitration Court to-day at any great length, nor is it necessary that I should do so, but I do ask that the Government may, at the earliest possible moment, provide for this industry a continuing tribunal which shall be able to take notice of troubles in their early stages, before they develop into the serious issues which they so rapidly become, and which shall be able to keep an oversight of&#39; the industry continuously, occupying, as it were, the position of conciliators, trying to &#39;bring the parties to agreement in the early stages of the conflict. That, it. seems to me, is the principal work of arbitration. We thought when the Conciliation and Arbitration Court was established that conciliation  would form tie principal part of its work, but we have lived to see that, owing to the legal technicalities with which the Court is surrounded, and the limited powers it possesses, most of its time is devoted- to matters remote from the issues that cause industrial disputes. So I hope that at this period the Ministry will immediately take into consideration a method of setting up a conciliation tribunal to deal with the coal-mining industry, and that, when that is dealt with, the principle may be extended to other of the larger industries of the Commonwealth, whose welfare- is inextricably bound up with the industrial and commercial life &#39;of tho community. </para>

            <para>.- It is quite true that the coal-mining industry is in a disturbed condition, and it is necessary, in the interests of tho industrial life of Australia, that a tribunal should be granted to it. We all know that the Arbitration Court is so congested, that it is utterly impossible for it to deal with an industry like coal mining, which requires immediate action when disputes occur. If they are .allowed to remain in abeyance for any length of time they become magnified, and,, as a result, industrial trouble disastrous to the whole Commonwealth ensues. </para>

              <para>- The miners have always appealed to the Federal Arbitration Court.

          <para>I understand that the Prime Minister intends to meet the representatives of both &#39;parties during next week, with the object of granting a Commission to inquire into the existing dispute. The miners, who held aggregate meetings about a week ago, decided that, in view of the probability of this tribunal dealing with their case in the near future, nothing drastic should be done. There is an impression abroad that the coal miners take undue action which is not justified in view of the wages they earn. I want to point out that the articles appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> during the last day or two, written, I am convinced, by some one representing the coal-owners, are misleading. They do not convey to the public the true position. One would think that in consequence of the tribunal granted during the war the conditions of the industry had been made such that tho  miners were able to make over and above a reasonable wage; but if we compare their earnings, especially those of the offhanded men, with the earnings of men in other parts of the world, we find that their increase is nothing like the increase obtained by the miners of Great Britain and elsewhere. The cost of our coal is lower than that of coal in any other part of the world, yet we are constantly told that we are increasing the price unnecessarily. The Minister for the Navy informed me recently that we paid &#163;2 15s. per ton on board for the best Welsh coal for the use of our warships. We supply coal at Newcastle for 17s. 6d. a ton. If the people of Victoria are paying an exorbitant price, the increase must take place between the port of shipment and the delivery here. </para>

              <para>- That is so. There is a shortage here, and it is contended in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> articles that that shortage is due to the men not working. I can assure the House that during the currency of the war no men suffered more than the coal miners because of the irregularity of work. The articles I have mentioned suggest that there were so many strikes and so many lost days in the year through the action of the men themselves. That is wrong. Whilst there may be a disturbance in one particular mine in the district it docs nor affect the output of the- coal unless there is a demand for the whole of the coal produced, and they are unable to meet  the demand. We put large quantities of coal on the grass during -the war to find employment for men who were starving. &#34;The British Government bought the coa&#93; in order to find work for men who were out of employment in consequence of the f oreign trade beano- cut off during the war, and also because the ships formerly engaged in carrying coal from Newcastle were taken off our coast. Yet we are asked to believe that the coal miners are responsible for the dearth in the supply of coal. As a matter of fact they are supplying more coal to-day than  they  did at any period during the war. 1 am glad to say that as great a percentage of miners went to the Front as of any other body of men in Australia. As those men come back, they are returning to their old occupation, and producing more coal. The output is being increased, but the rate of wages they are receiving is not in keeping with what they are entitled to in comparison with the high cost of living. While their wages went up 39 per cent, the cost of living has gone up by over 60 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Yes; the cost of coal went up during the war, and the wages of the miners went up accordingly, but our coal to-day is cheaper than any other. Latest newspapers from England show that Yorkshire coal for bunkers was selling as follows: - Screened, 80s. a ton; unscreened, 75s.; slack, 60s. Welsh coal for export was from 110s. to 112s. per ton for large, and 97s. 6d. for small. We sell the very best of ours for 17s. 6d. We sell what is called &#34; shandygaff,&#34; or unscreened, for lis. or 12s. per ton; so that our commodity is produced very cheaply compared with what is charged in other parts of the world. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; and they are cutting off the export at Home at the present time because of the shortage. The main pivot of the present dispute here is the pay of the coal-mine labourer, although there are other claims which have to be settled between now and October. The labourers, as I said, get 13s. 6d. per day. At a recent conference in Sydney the owners promised to give them lis. 6d. Many people are under the impression that that would mean six days&#39; work at 14s. 6d. a day. Let me show honorable members what the labourers have been earning during the last year or two. From 15th May, 1919, to- 23rd March, 1920, their wages were as follows: - At Aberdare the number of days worked was 162-jr, and the men earned &#163;109 17s. each for the year. Do honorable members think a man can live and support a family decently on &#163;109 per annum? At Burwood, the men averaged &#163;2 2s. lOd. per week for the same period; at Cessnock. &#163;2 7s. per week; at Dudley, &#163;2 lis. 7d. ; and at the Co-operative, which is the highest I have, &#163;2 13s. 7d. per week. Those figures are vouched for as showing the exact amount of money that these men have lifted during recent years. The result is dissatisfaction; but can we expect anything else? Can men support families on such wages? Some action must be taken immediately. It is not fair to say that, the men are responsible when a dislocation of industry takes place. They have given ample notice and have endeavoured, by conference, to have the whole matter adjusted. The off-hand men are asking for &#163;1 per day, and in view of the present high cost of living that is little enough for them. They may average, during the year, only three or four days&#39; work per week, and in that event will earn only &#163;3 or &#163;4 per week. </para>

              <para>- Exactly . In view of the high cost of commodities it is only fair that these men should be granted an increase. On different occasions in this  House, when I have been dealing with the question of high prices, I have heard it said, &#34; What about the miners? Are they not exacting all they can from the public?&#34; I hope we shall not hear that statement repeated. The coal miners, during the war, behaved splendidly, and the Prime Minister&#39;s action, at that time, in appointing a tribunal to settle their differences was quite justified. Since then the&#62; cost of everything has increased. Miners&#39; tools, for instance, cost to-day 120 per cent, more than they did before the war. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; they cost over- 100 per cent, more than they did before the war. The same may be said with regard to detonators and fuse. The cost of everything used by&#39; the miner has considerably increased. Many miners are paying, out of their wages, as much as &#163;2 per fortnight in respect of their tools  and the union and other charges. </para>

              <para>- No. Before the war their outgoings in that respect probably amounted to about 10s. per fortnight. Costs have increased to such an extent as to amply justify the appointment of a tribunal before which the miners&#39; grievances may be brought &#39;and adjusted. To leave the settlement of these differences to the ordinary routine of the Arbitration Court would be very unsatisfactory. Both sides would welcome the appointment of a special tribunal for the industry, before which they could go from .time to time and state their grievances, so that on the evidence given a decision as to what was a fair thing could be arrived at. &#39;The miners themselves do not desire any dislocation of the trade and industry of the Commonwealth. They are most anxious that their disputes should be amicably settled, and there can be no doubt that they must be adjusted. The men cannot continue on a mere pittance, quite insufficient to support them and their families. If they cannot promptly obtain redress from us we must expect industrial trouble. From that there can be no escape. I hope therefore that the Prime Minister will grant a tribunal to the industry. Such action on his part is absolutely necessary if a crisis is to be averted. I think I can safely say, on behalf of the leaders of the miners, that if we give them a fair deal they will do all they can to keep the wheels of industry going. They have publicly stated that they will ; they have made such announcements at meetings of the men. It is very hard for the officers of the unions, at the present time, to restrain the men, who ara very anxious to have their wrongs speedily righted. The men say - &#34;What is the use of any longer deferring action?&#34; Those who have held responsible positions in industrial organizations know what it is to be called upon constantly to advise a body of men to postpone definite action in tho hope that something will turn up to relieve the position. When disappointment follows disappointment, the men ultimately become exasperated. Their patience gives out, and when that happens they get out of control. No matter how anxious the officials may be to prevent strikes, when  week after week goes  by  without any improvement in their position, the men ultimately say, &#34; We will not work, since we cannot get redress of our grievances. It is useless for the officials to promise time after time that they are going to do suchandsuch a thing, and to find that they are unable to have &#39;a tribunal appointed.&#34; It is only right that, when the leaders of the miners are trying to keep the wheels of industry going - and, having perused the reports of the speeches at the aggregate meeting, I. know that they are - we should help them  &#39;by  granting, this tribunal to . deal with the difficulties of the miners. I hope that the Prime Minister will agree to this request, and that we shall have a permanent tribunal before which the disputes which emanate from the miners from time to time may be settled in a proper and satisfactory way. </para>

I propose to deal with one or two of the matters mentioned  by  the honorable member for Hunter, who has rightly said that the question of coal is of the utmost import.ance to every State in the Commonwealth. It affects practically every home, and indirectly every phase of industry, so that it is of paramount importance to the Australian public. The honorable member dealt calmly and dispassionately with this question. He showed a complete grip of details, and the information he gave in regard to the wages, costs, and expenses of the miners has contributed very materially to the knowledge of the House, so that I think we owe him our thanks. While he was speaking, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> interjected that the inability to obtain coal was the chief trouble. I understood the honorable member to reply that that was not .so, but I do not wish to misrepresent him. </para>

              <para>- Quite recently I have heard evidence given before a Select Committee, appointed by this House, in regard to ,the shipping situation on the Australian coast. Honorable members may be interested to learn that evidence was given, before that tribunal that at the present moment shipping was being held up at Newcastle and kept waiting for coal. I confess (that I heard that statement with some- astonishment.; but, since it was made calmly and -cool&#39;ly by a man <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> is  in  a position to secure ^absolutely authentic information, we must attach weight to it. In the circumstances, there must be a good deal in what the  Leader  of the Opposition interjected in regard to the difficulty of obtaining- coal. The coal shortage cannot be attributed .to the absence of shipping facilities, because, our own Inter-State colliers have quite recently been held -up for cargoes of coal at Newcastle. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to have that explanation. I was surprised at the statement to which I have referred, and I  thought that possibly some reasonable explanation of it could be given by the miners. I do not wish to throw stones at them, but I repeat that Inter-State colliers quite recently have been  held  up at- Newcastle. </para>

          <para>I wish to emphasize what the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> urged, despite the various interruptions to which he was subjected, as to the need for the appointment of a tribunal to .deal with the particular difficulties that confront the coal trade at the present time. On both sides of the House there is a recognition of the fact that the tribunal created under the War Precautions Act was necessary, and that since that Act and the regulations made under it will shortly disappear some other tribunal for the industry should be created, so that employers and employees may. meet before it, and have their- grievances dealt with. In the first speech that I made in this House after my return from the. United Kingdom last year, I outlined my strong belief in and support of proposals to bring together employers and employees, so that my attitude in supporting the honorable member for Illawarra this morning is entirely consistent with that which I have taken up since my return. I believe in the principles embodied in the report of the Whitley Commission, which must commend themselves to both employers and employees in this country. Knowing how employees in the . United Kingdom have been able, not in isolated cases, but in many instances, to improve their position, while employers in their turn have been able to look into the difficulties that confront their employees under the system recommended by that Commisison, I feel satisfied that its adoption here would bring about a better and more complete understanding .between the two&#39; parties. If, as the result of this debate, we obtain from the Ministry this morning a statement as to how they intend to deal with this question, the action taken by the honorable member for Illawarra will have been amply justified. I repeat that all the States- are interested in this matter, and I make noapology for referring to the Western Australian point of view. In that State we are dependent on- Newcastle for the bulk of our bunker coal. </para>

              <para>- No doubt. The position of the industry is not fully understood by the people. During the period of the war the whole of the export trade was practically suspended, whilst, in addition, many vessels were taken off the coastal trade. As a result, the mines and . the miners had a very rough time. The. war having terminated, shipping is gradually returning to the coast. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burchell)</inline> complained that coal is not being sent to other ports from Newcastle as quickly as it might be. </para>

              <para>- The honorable mem-, ber and I are both members of the Sea Carriage Committee, and he knows that . the late Controller of Shipping, although he found fault with other ports, had no fault to find with the handling of ships at Newcastle. If there is any hold-up of shipping at ^Newcastle to-day the fault does not lie with the miners or those whoload the ships. The real cause is, I believe, that certain people are putting their heads together to give preference to foreign orders, because of the fact that, coal brings a much higher price in France and other parts of the world than ire Australia. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Quite a number of Japanese ships have been loaded at Newcastle, and one can only conclude that the profits to be derived by selling coal on the other side of the world are greater than those to be obtained in the local trade. That is a phase of the question into which the Prime Minister would be well advised to look. Whilst I do not wish to hamper or restrict the export trade in any way, I think that in respect of coal, as with any other commodity, Australian requirements should be met first. </para>

          <para>Apart from the dislocation of the industry caused by the war, the coal miners have always been misunderstood and misrepresented. They stand in a different position from any other workers, inasmuch as they are, to a large extent, contractors, and although published statements of the gross receipts of a couple of coal miners would make it appear that those engaged in the industry are receiving a very good wage, yet, after deducting the expenses of upkeep of tools, lighting, explosives, and other charges, the net wage is considerably reduced. The wages of the coal miners are usually referred to by the daily rate instead of by the weekly or fortnightly rate. A man may in some instances be receiving &#163;1 per day for three months while he happens to be working in a good place, but, on the other hand, he may be only working two or three days per week. In analyzing the earnings of men employed in this industry, we should take their weekly or yearly receipts instead of the daily pay. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister&#39;s statement only emphasizes the need for appointing a special tribunal to deal with this industry, the conditions of which are continually changing. To-day the miners may be working in hard ground; next month they may be working in soft ground. The machinery of the Arbitration Court is not such as will give a speedy settlement in respect of irritation and disputes that arise from the constantly varying conditions of the industry. Prompt decisions by a competent tribunal would keep the industry going continually. I hope there is truth in the press statement that the Prime Minister proposes to consider a method of dealing with industrial disputes that would be more direct and speedy than the Arbitration Court. The coal-mining industry is second in importance to none, and I hope that Before this year is concluded the Government will have appointed a tribunal to regulate the conditions. The differences which arise out of the varying conditions of employment ought to be adjusted, and the industry placed on a basis which will insure continuous employment, so that the coal  miners of Australia may be able to earn wages at least us good as those which obtain in the Old World to-day. No doubt, as the result of experience gained under war conditions, the conditions of the industry in England have been so improved that they are now even better than those in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister to appoint, at the earliest possible moment, a tribunal for the control of the coal-mining industry, and to take steps to insure that due attention is paid to local requirements of coal, without unduly harassing the export trade. </para>

            <para>. -  The honorable member for Newcastle has put to me a question concerning a matter in regard to which both the employers and employees have had several conferences with me in Sydney; and I ought not to leave the miners any more than the mineowners and the general public in any doubt as to what the Government propose to do. I had not the advantage of hearing the whole of the remarks of the honorable member who moved the adjournment of the House. I am sorry that neither the occasion nor the scope of the motion permits one to deal with the question of remedial industrial legislation as fully as it deserves. It is, in my opinion now, as it always has been, the first question, the great question ; all others are subordinate. It is very evident that, unless production goes on smoothly, neither the financial, political, nor general circumstances of the Commonwealth can be satisfactory. </para>

          <para>Honorable members know my views in regard to arbitration. I speak as onewho has had some experience in the Arbitration Court, and has had direct relations, as had the honorable members for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> and Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> with the. unions themselves; and I say deliberately, as a result of that long experience, that I am moro than ever convinced that the present arbitration machinery is quite inadequate; and, indeed, unsuited for the purposes of many industries. Further, I cannot see how any alteration of the present machinery of the Arbitration Court - sweeping away this or that obstacle - can enable it . to grapple with the circumstances of an industry of this kind. I am sorry that the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> has moved the adjournment of the House just at this moment; but, since he has done so I will avail myself of the opportunity to say what I think upon this matter; because every act that I have taken &#39;in the direction of dealing with disputes which have arisen has been the subject of very severe criticism, not only by the press, but by the  President  of the Arbitration Court. Now, as practical men, we have to deal with things as they are. Strikes occur. No doubt they ought not to occur ; but, as a fact, they do. And we have to deal with facts as they are. It is no good saying that when there ;is a strike we should sit down and do nothing. Strikes must be dealt with. When I was the leader of great unions I did exactly as I do now. I endeavoured to deal with facts as they existed. It is no good saying to the unions - any more than Canute to the on-coming tide - &#34; Thus far, and no further.&#34; We have to deal with facts; and the great fact of the industrial world is industrial unrest, which sometimes, despite every effort at prevention, manifests itself in strikes. We say to the unions, &#34; Here is the Arbitration Court. Enter here; attorn to this jurisdiction; seek remedy for your grievances in a Court where, perhaps, if you are fortunate, you may get ail award in twelve months&#39; time.&#34; I repeat what I have already said here. When I was leading tho transport workers, after having tried every other means to secure more speedy redress, and having failed, it became absolutely necessary to strike in. order to get into the Court. The union struck accordingly. And I would act again in the same manner if I were placed in the same position to-day. But if the coal miners were to strike, and remain on strike, what would be the position? They would immediately put themselves out of Court; for the Court, quite properly, has said, &#34; You cannot have strikes and arbitration too.&#34; That is true, but one of the reasons for the precipitation of strikes  i9  that arbitration is so tardy, the approaches to the Court are so tortuous, the pitfalls so numerous, and the expenses so huge. Conditions may change completely between the date of approaching the Court and the time of securing an award. A union may apply for an award to-day and get no relief until eighteen months&#39; time. Meanwhile, conditions may have drastically changed ; but the union cannot get an award adapted to thenewconditions for the reason that it is limited by its claim. In past instances I have appointed special tribunals to deal with specific cases, and for such actions I have been censured by the press and by  His  Honour. I do not deserve this censure, because surely it is the duty of a Government to endeavour to, find some means of reconciling industrial parties, and, if existing machinery does not afford such means, then the machinery must be created. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member will consent to wait patiently, he will find that I have a general remedy to expound. As matters are now, the coal miners are working under awards or orders made under the War Precautions Act. A special tribunal was appointed under that Statute. The orders regulate the price of coal, the wages to be paid to the miners, and, indeed, all the circumstances of the industry. It was a convenient and flexible tribunal, always ready at the moment when it was wanted. I established this tribunal originally in 1916; and when I was away overseas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> dealt further with the matter, and the miners are working under these orders or awards to-day. I am not touching on the merits of the case, but it is now said that circumstances have changed. It is stated, for example, that the lower-paid wageearners, who are receiving the 13s. 6d. rate, cannot make sufficient in. an elevendays&#39; fortnight upon which to live. That is the main point. They cannot get redress in the Arbitration Court for that principal grievance. There is no tribunal but the tribunal created under the War Precautions Act. The latter, however, will shortly expire, and, directly it does- </para>

              <para>- I do not want to have anything to do with him or with his modern associates. I am trying to expound a point which, I feel sure - whatever honorable members&#39; attitudes maybe on other questions - will be admitted as being appropriate for consideration in and by this Chamber. In my opinion, the coal trade cannot be dealt with by existing legal machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes. It musthave machinery set up which will be flexible, suited to all the circumstances of the industry, and ready at any and every moment to deal with every passing phase of unrest. &#39; That hypothesis involves the establishment of a special tribunal. It means, amongst other things, the appointment of a tribunal specifically to settle disputes and interpret awards or agreements in and for the coal trade only. Why not? Is there any good reason why there should not be such a tribunal? None whatever! The honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> stated that the coal-mining industry was a basic industry.  If  we had  no coal there would be an end to all manufactures, an end to the commercial and industrial activities of the country. And, therefore, it is worth while for us to endeavour, as far as possible, to bring about for that industry complete and lasting industrial peace. </para>

          <para>Let me describe for honorable members the kind of tribunal which I believe in; and I wish them to think the matter over, because a Bill will be introduced next week to give effect to these ideas. I believe in a tribunal based somewhat on the lines of the shipbuilding tribunal. There is a body on which both sides are represented; and there is a  chairman  also. I do notsay for one moment that, in addition to a tribunal to deal with the coalmining industry as a whole, subordinate tribunals should not be appointed to deal with various parts of the New South Wales coal fields and, indeed, the scattered coal centres, no matter in what part of Australia. But I am speaking of the general principle. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The tribunal which deals with the shipbuilding industry frequently issues two and three awards in one week. As they come before me I read these decisions of my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Connington,</inline> with the greatest pleasure.They are models of what judgments in industrial matters ought to be. And, after all, the objective of all such legislation is to get and keep an industry going, and the outstanding fact is that the shipbuilding tribunal has kept the industry going ; which is the very best commendation one could utter. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that is the only reason. There are others, but it is not proposed that lawyers shall have access to the tribunals which I intend to create. I must say this on behalf of my much maligned profession, however, that I havefound, when lawyers have been excluded from the Court&#39;s, that there has arisen a class of men, with regard to whom I am bound to associate the phrase <inline font-style="italic">cacocthes loquendi.</inline> They talk and talk and talk; and I am sure that no lawyer on earth could talk more fully or fervently. There is one such individual in particular whom I have in mind. He attends the Arbitration Courts in New South Wales. He is not a lawyer; but let anybody endure him, as I have had to do, for an hour, two hours, and three hours; and - well, Patrick Henry said, &#34; Give me liberty or give me death.&#34; The American patriot did not know that there was a third alternative, namely that of having to suffer&#39; the eloquence of gentlemen such as these. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted on motion by</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkins.&#93;</inline></para>

              <para>- I shall conclude in a very few words. The Government proposes next week to bring in a Bill for the creation of special tribunals for the control of different industries. These tribunals will comprise an equal number of employers and employees, presided over by a  chairman.  They will have jurisdiction over disputes and over the circumstances of particular industries. They may partake of the form of the shipping tribunal which is always available, so that, in the case, for instance, of the mining industry, if any dispute occur and a stoppage of work be threatened, there will always be ready to hand a tribunal! to which the miners and the mine-owners may turn. The shipping tribunal does settle in this way disputes such as demarcation troubles, the question as to which trade shall do this work or that work, and other similar differences. They thread their way through troubles which would puzzle a Philadelphian lawyer, and they keep the industry going. This legislation will be introduced next week, in order to enable me to give effect to my promise to the coal miners if they agree to the terms put forward by me for the appointment and jurisdiction of this special tribunal. </para>

              <para>- It is not fair to ask me at this stage to deal with this matter other than in general terms. It is the intention of the Government to introduce this measure next week, so that I may keep faith with the miners and do all that is possible to prevent strikes, because that is the problem which we are up against. The War Precautions Act might go out any day. Certainly it will soon cease to be operative, so that if no other provision be made the miners will be left in mid-air again. Nobody will pretend that there is not something about coal raining that breeds a good deal of discontent. And that is only natural. I suspect that if I were a coal miner myself I should be at the head of all this agitation. I am notifying honorable members generally, and particularly the representatives of the coal-mining industries, the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond),</inline> the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> of the intentions of the Government to create special tribunals to deal with all disputes that cannot be, or are not, dealt with by the Arbitration Court. This should not be regarded as a reflection on the Arbitration Court at all. That Court has . done excellent work, but, in my opinion, it is not flexible, speedy, or economical enough to serve the varying circumstances of many industries in this country. </para>

            <para>. - No subject is of more importance to the general community than this question of industrial unrest, particularly in the coal-mining industry; and I should like to make one or two observations with reference to the proposed special tribunals mentioned by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I have always contended that a great centralized Arbitration Court must necessarily be a  clumsy, slow-moving piece of machinery, quite unable to attack problems as they arise from time to time in the varied conditions of Australian industries. I believe a Court for every important industry will prove the ideal method of handling industrial disputes in the future. How can it be expected that a Judge of the Arbitration Court shall know everything of every industry? And yet it seems to be a fundamental theory of the Arbitration Court procedure that the Judge should be master of all the facts of all our industries, and thus be able to appraise conditions with an approach to equity. No man can be expected to possess all these qualities. I know of no one who is big enough and wise enough to handle all these problems in their own atmosphere and environment. The costliness of arbitration procedure is, to some extent, due to the fact that a Judge has to spend days and days possessing himself of the facts in relation to a dispute. These facts have to be hammered . into him by experts on either side, when in reality he ought, at the outset, to be thoroughly conversant with all the facts &#39;in a broad and general way in relation to the industry concerned. Therefore, it seems to me to be proper that we should seek to set up special tribunals in the form of a Court for every important industry. I do not know that I should favour an elaborate Court such as we have to-day. I prefer some kind of simple Court of Conciliation, with arbitration in reserve, to attack the various problems as they arise, and on the spot. I have in mind the experiences of the Mother Country in this matter. Compulsory arbitration is not favoured in England. They  can do much better by means of special tribunals comprised of men who devote the whole of their lives to the settlement of industrial troubles in relation to particular industries. </para>

              <para>- The profit is, 9 per cent. on the average, and means, as I say, about 5s. a week per man employed. Another fact that Sankey established was that there are whole counties in the Old Country where the coalmining industry does not pay at all. </para>

The honorable member challenged me to show what Sankey had done at Home, and now that I am telling him, he does not appear to like the facts at all. The honorable member asked me for facts, but facts are such total strangers to him that he does not know what to do with them when he gets them. The best thing that could be done would be to throw the light of day on the facts of all these industries, . because nothing would so tend to cure the industrial unrest. </para>

              <para>- I told honorable members the otherday here what I thought about mining; aud if my opinion is desired, I may say that I think the miner is entitled to every reasonable consideration; he is entitled to a good wage for his work, and also entitled to perform that work under the best possible conditions. In reply to the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> I may add that I have done more for the miner in my time, in the way of bettering: his conditions, than I am afraid the honorable member himself will ever do. The honorable member ought not to sit there and taunt me in regard to these matters. I remind him that I assisted in New South Wales in securing that every miner was paid his full weight, and I also helped to secure him good ventilation, neither of which he had enjoyed before. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is not old enough to know anything about it. I do not know why there should be all these interjections. The moment I begin to lay before the House a few facts I am assailed in this way. I suppose I must apologize to my friends opposite for daring to express the slightest sympathy with the miner, seeing that they claim a monopoly of that sympathy. That, however, must not prevent mefrom expressing my opinion. Despite all this gibing and jeering, I still say that I think I have done as much for the miner as has any honorable member opposite, and there is nothing that I would not do to help him. </para>

              <para>- I quite agree with you, sir. But as the Prime Minister has seen fit to refer to our mutual exchanges in the industrial arena in 1909, I am quite satisfied to place my record in the industrial movement alongside of his. I admit that, because of my years, it is considerably shorter than his, but it is also considerably cleaner. </para>

I am merely desirous of seeing that the decencies of debate are preserved, and that our Standing Orderspre observed. The honorable member, in making an offensive personal allusion to  the Prime Minister, has transgressed the Standing Orders. Only a minute previously I called upon the Prime Minister  to . withdraw an offensive interjection which he had made in regard to the honorable member himself, and I now cask the honorable member to withdraw the offensive statement which he has made concerning the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- I again say that no individual who has temporarily occupied the position of mouth-piece of the  industrialists -of this country can be held responsible for the prevailing industrial unrest. The unrest is inherent in the economic basis of society, and nobody knows that better than does the Prime Minister. So long as society is constituted as it is, neither the special tribunal proposed to be appointed by the Prime Minister nor the Arbitration Court can remedy it, because it is inherent in the conflicting interests of employers and employees. Therefore, my own view is that these periodical tests of strength between opposing forces must continue so long as society is constituted as it is at present. It is idle to apply plasters to the outside of the skin in order to cure a disease which is deep-seated in our economic system. As society is constituted to-day - divided as it is fundamentally into two classes, whose interests are opposed to each other - I contend that there can be no adjustment until the basis of our present economic system is altered. Holding that view, and expressing it as I intend to do both inside and outside of this Chamber- </para>

            <para>.- As a home-grown Tasmanian, I claim to know something about the industrial conditions which exist in the island State, so far as they are affected by the coal shortage. Tasmania is not blessed with any gas coal which can be used for industrial or smelting purposes. But if the &#39; other States of the Commonwealth bad done what Tasmania has done, so far&#39; as their water supplies are concerned, there would be no coal trouble to-day. In Tasmania we have one of the greatest hydro-electric schemes to be found in the world. True, it is only in the process of making, though it is working at the present time. That scheme has helped Tasmania to carry on ifc3 industrial operations during the past few years, notwithstanding the troubles consequent upon a shortage of coal and shipping in Australia.  </para>

              <para>- I am pointing out how we have had to help ourselves, and how pleased the people of Tasmania will be if the tribunal suggested by the Prime Minister be established. But, in addition to tho question of maintaining the output of coal, Tasmanians are directly interested in the question of shipping, and if the Prime Minister can provide us with increased shipping, he will be doing us a very great service indeed. I know that recently several large industries hare  decided to -establish new factories in Tasmania. That  mean3  that that State will be a bigger customer for coal than it has eyer been previously. Its people, therefore, are vitally interested in the establishment of the proposed industrial tribunal, and, as I have before stated, they are also intensely interested in the question of shipping. The statement made by the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> regarding the output of coal for foreign parts is a serious one if it means that the industries of Australia are going to be faced with a shortage of coal. I hope that this particular aspect of the situation will not be lost sight of. I have no desire to occupy time unduly, because I understand that the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> wishes to reply, but honorable members opposite must surely recognise that the proposals which have been outlined by the Prime Minister will do something to ease the present situation. If they are not of that opinion, why do they not submit concrete proposals of their own? I sincerely trust that effect will be given to the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister, because I believe they will be to the advantage of the coal industry of Australia. </para>

            <para>.- I intend to speak only for a few minutes. When the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> rose to speak to this motion, he questioned my right to smile, and asked me my reason for smiling. I think it is perfectly obvious to every honorable member why this motion has been submitted. The reason has been made clearer by the fact that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have spoken at considerable length upon it. In short, their speeches smacked a good deal of Ballarat, and were evidently for the purpose of preventing a motion standing in the name of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> from being debated. Had the Government been sincerely desirous of preventing industrial unrest they could have taken steps long before this to make such amendments in our Conciliation and Arbitration Act as would have rendered the approaches to the Arbitration Court less .tortuous, and would have expedited the hearing of cases coming before that tribunal. They have not done these things, and, in; my humble opinion, no effective tribunal will be established to deal with these matters unless it has the power of deciding upon the purchasing power of the wages which it awards. After all, that is the real question. The Prime Minister stated that he had no power to bring to  ani  end the War Precautions Act, under which  a  certain tribunal now exists. I joined issue with him, and I denied his statement. </para>

              <para>- I propose to point out the section im the War Precautions Act which gives the Prime Minister the power which he says he does not possess. Section 2 of this Act provides that the GovernorGeneral may proclaim the date upon which the war shall be deemed to have ended. If the Governor-General issued such  a  proclamation, it would be issued on the advice of the Prime Minister and his Ministers, and there is no doubt that, in such circumstances, the Act would come to an end. But even in the absence of such  a  proclamation I intend to show, upon the authority of the Prime Minister&#39;s own words, uttered in this House on the 1st October, 1919, that the War Precautions Act has expired. Upon page 12843 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of last year the Prime Minister is thus reported : - </para>

            <para>Whatever powers we have at the present time under the War Precautions Act have their roots in the defence sub-section. From the judgments of even the majority in the bread case it is perfectly clear that, whatever powers we have, which are not strictly those belonging to the Commonwealth under the Constitution, spring wholly from the existence of a state of war, or of preparation for war. Neither of these conditions is now present. War is oyer; peace lias come to us with complete victory over our enemies. Neither war nor the need for preparations for defence against a declared enemy exists. In three months the War Precautions Act itself expires; our powers under the War Precautions Act have now shrunk, if, indeed, they have not altogether disappeared. </para>

            <para>- Yes. My point of order is that, as my notice of motion is at the top of to-day&#39;s business-paper, the Government should allow it to be dealt with as the first item of business for to-day, or  else adopt such other course as would permit honorable members to express their views on the merits of the motion, even if it only be by voting upon it. I contend that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has placed the motion at the head of the businesspaper, I should have been called on to move it, and thus given the opportunity of putting my case before Parliament and the country, as far as the newspapers which oppose us would permit. If the Government had been desirous of having any other course adopted, it was their place to move that the notice of motion be removed from its place at the head of the business-paper, where, according to the answer given to the honorable member for Capricornia this morning, it had been placed by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in accordance with the usual practice and the ruling laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder. Finding my motion at the head of the businesspaper, which the Government always arrange, I naturally assumed that it would be the first business called on to-day. The Government, who admit they are hanging on by the skin of their teeth, have not been courteous enough to intimate that they had no intention of allowing me to submit it to the House or discuss its merits. I spoke to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> this morning, and from what you told me I assumed that my motion would be called on as the first item of business to-day. I do not know what has transpired since. By not treating my motion as a censure motion, the Ministry are doing something which hasnever been done previously in the case of no-confidence motions. I can call to mind many instances in which motions of dissent from the rulingsof the Chair have been placed at the bottom of the business-paper, and honorable members thereby deprived of the opportunity of debating them, but the Government have not intimated to me, nor to any honorable member of the Labour party, as they should have done, that they intended to take similar action in regard to my motion. When I gave notice of the motion yesterday, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> said that it smacked too much of Ballarat, and that the Ministry would take no notice of it. </para>

            <para>- I could draw no other conclusion from the Minister&#39;s remarks. When the Prime Minister entered the chamber a few moments later, I asked him what action the Government intended to take in regard to the notice of motion, and he said that he would treat it in the ordinary way. The ordinary way in regard to no-confidence motions is to allow them to be called on for discussion. My point of order is that while my notice of motion stands on the business-paper, and at the head of the sheet, Orders of the Day should not have been called on; that is to say, the censure motion should be disposed of before any other business is transacted. </para>

            <para>- The usual practice is for no-confidence motions to take precedence. If the Prime Minister or any member of the Ministry desiresto burke the discussion of this or any other notice of motion, and prevent the Opposition from having the opportunity of telling the people what the Ministry have done, or have failed to do, we shall not have that harmony in the House which is necessary for the transaction of business. If the Government intended to treat the Opposition in this fashion, they should have intimated, either publicly across the table, or privately, that they had no intention of treating my motion as a noconfidence motion, and would place it at the bottom of the business-paper; but, in view of the fact that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or the Government, or you and the Government, have placed my notice of motion at the top of the business-paper, it cannot be removed from that position except by a vote of the House. Let a Minister move to postpone it until Doomsday, or until the Day of Judgment. That, at least, would be an honest course, and would be treating the House with courtesy;but this method of burking the question and preventing honorable members from speaking on or voting upon it is absolutely unfair. </para>

        <para class="block">He charges the Government with discourtesy. He claims that we should have notified him thatwe intended to act other than as provided by the customs of parliamentary procedure and the Standing Orders of the House. The Standing Orders are perfectly clear. The procedure to be followed is set out in standing order 119, of which the honorable member cannot plead ignorance, because on one occasion, when I had the honour of being a colleague of his, I was pulled up in the middle of a very spirited harangue on a motion which had been moved by my right honorable colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. AndrewFisher,</inline> although I had not been going five minutes by the clock. I was pulled up because the operation of standing order 119 interrupted all further debate on the motion. As its effect was quite new to us all, this sank into our minds, and the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> knows perfectly well how the standing order applies. As to the question of courtesy, it has always been the practice, from time immemorial, for the Leader of the Opposition intending to move a motion of censure to give the Prime Minister : notice of it. </para>

So far as discourtesy is concerned, the honorable member has been most discourteous to me, although I have always been most courteous to him. There was no reason whatever why he should not have informed me of the step he intended taking. The Leader of the Opposition has spoken as if this motion was of some interest to the country. He must remember, however, that his party is now down to twenty-four or twentyfive. </para>

            <para>- Order! I do not require any assistance from honorable members in connexion with this matter, and I am prepared to give my ruling. The point has been &#39;decided long ago, and we have a well-established precedent for the course now being adopted. I can fully appreciate the position mentioned by the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> but, unfortunately, that is a difficulty which is not of my making, and one which has resulted owing to the operation of our Standing Orders. The rule, as honorable members know, is that at the expiration of two hours from the time of the meeting of the House, all motions not then disposed of must be interrupted and Orders of the Day called on. That has been our practice whenever motions of this character have been before the House. Questions upon notice have, at times, been taken before Orders of the Day, with the concurrence of the House. But it is not strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders. The practice of calling on Orders of the&#39; Day on the expiration of the two-hour limitation for motions is departed from on occasions when the Government decide they will not transact any business until a noconfidence motion i3 disposed of. In this case, the Government have intimated their intention of going on with public business in the ordinary way; so, although the notice of motion in question is the first on the business-paper, and is placed before Government business, it must be dealt with before the expiration of two hours after the meeting of the House, at which time Orders of the Day must be called on or be interrupted. This question was debated on the 7th November, 1913, when the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> took an active part in a discussion relating to a no-confidence motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> On that occasion, a Friday, the motion was reached and discussed, and after the expiration of two hours it was interrupted under standing order 119, and was set down on the following Tuesday&#39;s noticepaper, a copy of which I have before me, as a first Order of the Day as private members&#39; business, Government Orders of the Day and Notices of Motion intervening. In this instance, the two hours allowed for motions had expired before this particular motion had a chance to be called on, and I had no option, under the circumstances, but to carry out the Standing Orders and allow the Orders of the Day to be proceeded with as the next business. The trouble this morning was that the motion was not reached owing to the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lamond)</inline> moving the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public business. </para>

            <para>- I can only speak of the facts. Several honorable members rose in their places to substantiate the urgency of the motion, which, therefore, had to be allowed to proceed, and the allotted two hours were absorbed before the motion of the honorable member for Yarra was reached. The fact that this is a no-confidence motion does not alter the principle at all. I quote from a ruling in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on the 7th November, 1913, where the following appears: - </para>

          <para>.- On the second reading, I said this section had beenweakened by the Government insisting on adopting the provision agreed to by the Convention for the safety of life at sea. Apparently, those engaged in working a ship are not to be counted. A vessel of less than 1,600 tons may carry a crew of 100, but, they are not to count. Apparently, the view of the Government is that sailors&#39; lives do not count for anything. I object to that view. I indicated then my intention to move an amendment to count all the persons, and not merely all the passengers on board a ship. This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. Many men who have learnt wireless at the Marconi School in Melbourne are anxious to obtain ships; but the shipping companies will not employ them until compelled to do so. I am anxious, for the safety oflife at sea, to provide that every vessel carrying passengers, or carrying over twelve persons as a crew, must be equipped with wireless. The lives of the sailors are just as important to them as the life of any person in the community is to him. It is all very well for honorable members opposite, who represent the wealthy classes, to think that they are the only ones that count. </para>

            <para>- They are sailing . vessels. I believe every vessel, steam or sail, should be included; and if the honorable member will move that every &#39;vessel going from State to State shall be equipped with wireless, I shall support him. All seamen and firemen, whose working conditions, after all, are not the best in the world, are entitled to this safeguard. Why, then, do the Government fix a limit of twelve passengers? When section 281 of the principal Act was passed in 1912, the then Minister told me that it made quite sufficient provision for the safety of life at sea. It  stipulated for wireless equipment on all vessels carrying &#34; fifty or more persons, &#34;including passengers and crew.5&#39;  We  &#34; have made rapid strides in radiotelegraphy since then, but the Convention for the safety of life at sea adopted the principle and the number laid down in our Navigation Act. &#39;.Chat Act has not been proclaimed as a whole, and the proclamation putting parts of it into force has been for some reason inoperative. It could not be said that the war was the reason, because the proclamation was issued after peace was signed, yet within a few weeks of its issue there was a change of policy, and the parts of the principal Act which had been proclaimed were not enforced. Many efficient wireless operators were compelled to remain here during the war, and I&#39; believe there are over 1.00 of them in Melbourne at this moment. There must be more in Sydney and other places, and they are all anxious that this provision should be brought into operation, because it will give them an opportunity of putting their training into practice. They will not get that chance so long as this provision remains inoperative. Every honorable member will admit that there is need for wireless equipment on sea-going vessels. Its value was proved quite recently, in the case of the oil-tank ship which was adrift in the Pacific. She had discharged her cargo of oil in New Zealand, and was coming to Australia, travelling light, met with an accident, and for some time </para>

        <para>*was drifting about the ocean.  Her  supplies of fuel became exhausted, and in order to obtain enough power to drive the dynamo, and so operate the wireless equipment, it was necessary practically to break up and use the whole of her fittings. In all probability she was a vessel of about 4,000 tons, and would carry a crew of forty or fifty. </para>

            <para>- That is so ; but I am anxious to extend this provision so that every vessel carrying a crew of twelve would have to be equipped with wireless. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will probably say that no such requirement was embodied by us in the Bill of 1912. I am quite willing to learn that that Bill is not as up to date as should be a Bill passed during the present session. Since 1912 marvellous strides have been made with wireless telegraphy. When the principal Act was passed, wireless was practically in its infancy. For every vessel trading to Australia which carried wireless in those days, there are now at least ten or a dozen; so equipped. Ordinary passenger ships find their wireless plants very useful in obtaining news for the information of those on board, while other vessels are equipped with wireless solely for the purposes of safety. Safety is the chief consideration that I have in mind. </para>

        <para>In the course of my second-reading speech I dealt chiefly with the question of wireless and the necessity for compelling all ships to carry efficient crews. Wireless equipment is all important for the safety of shipping. It has been the means of summoning aid again and again to vessels in distress. Subsequent to the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic,</inline> and before the holding of the Conference for the Protection of Life at Sea, the <inline font-style="italic">Voltuna</inline> caught fire in the Atlantic Ocean. By means of wireless she summoned to her aid vessels of almost every nationality ; but owing to the heavy sea that was running, not one of them was able to launch a boat to go to the help of her crew. Ultimately, by means of wireless, she got into communication with an oil tank steamer, which, on arrival at the scene, poured large volumes of oil on the waters, and so settled them as to enable a rescue to be effected. </para>

            <para>- I wish first of all to hear the views of the Minister on this subject. I gave special attention to it on the motion for the second reading, and as I had the honour of piloting through the House the Bill passed in 1912, I think I am entitled to expect from him the courtesy of a reply. The Minister should state at once the views of the Government in regard to this question. I certainly am not &#34; stonewalling &#34; this clause. It is estimated by experts that on only about one day in five it is possible to launch a boat in the Atlantic. If a vessel has a list to starboard the davits on the port side are practically useless, and although a ship may be able to summon assistance, the chances of rescue are not great. But we should provide every opportunity of rescue, and that is why I plead for better conditions in regard to wireless. Many vessels that were torpedoed during the war remained afloat sufficiently long to summon assistance by wireless. Vessels that have lost their propeller have drifted in mid-ocean for days. </para>

            <para>- On a point of order, sir, I submit that these remarks are quite out of order. The clause has relation to wireless. The remarks of the honorable member for West Sydney bear upon the Ballarat by-election, and have to do, also, with the condition of mind of certain people in Ballarat. I submit that these matters are not covered by the specific clause now under discussion, and that, therefore, the honorable member is out of order and will be continuing to defy the Chair in proceeding upon his threatened course. I suggest, further, although he is a new member, and thus has a right to be given every latitude, that you should make the honorable gentleman understand that he cannot longer continue to defy the Chair. I emphasize that none of his remarks are relevant; that, indeed, they are entirely out of order, and ought not to be continued or repeated. </para>

            <para>- I was about to show, provided that the opportunity were given me, why, in my opinion, it is inadvisable to postpone the consideration of this clause. I propose to do so by indicating that the fears expressed by the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> were not well grounded, and that there was every reason why the Committee should make up its mind in favour of the Government&#39;s amendment. I take it that I will be entirely in order in so doing, and, as a matter of fact, I think my remarks will be really more closely related to the motion of the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> than those employed by the honorable gentleman himself. Iunderstood, when I rose a few moments ago, that if I was prepared to indicate the extent to which the Government proposed to proceed this afternoon, the honorable member for West Sydney would not seek to press his motion to a division. </para>

Honorable members opposite declare that they, and they alone, represent the working men of this country, and our seafaring community, and yet they have adopted this attitude simply because they are not pleased with the turn of events to-day, and find that their ignorance of the Standing Orders has allowed them to get into their present position. There is every reason why we should proceed immediately with the consideration of this clause. The Government in their desire to do the fair thing by the seamen, decided to extend, to a very much greater extent, the provisions relating to the wireless installation on vessels trading along our coast and to Australia. All this has been done in the interests of seafaring men. </para>

            <para>- That is hardly a point of order. Part of what the honorable gentleman has said is quite correct. The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> wandered from the motion on several occasions, and I called him to order. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> who is in charge of the Bill, attempted to do so too, and I also called him to order. Since then the Minister has confined himself most strictly to a statement of his reasons why, in his opinion, the clause should not be postponed. He referred to the urgency of the measure in the interests of the seamen, and was giving his reasons why discussion on the clause should proceed when the honorable member intervened. If the Minister attempts to go outside the motion again, I shall once more call him to order. </para>

So far as is humanly possible I have, at all events, endeavoured to make my remarks relevant to the motion. Iwas about to say that I have statisticsrelating to a large number of vessels which trade to the port of Melbourne, and which, under the original Act, are not called upon to have wireless installations, but which, under the amendment, must be so equipped. I do not &#39;desire to read the list of such vessels, for it is a long one of over sixty. </para>

            <para>- I was listening very carefully and acutely - as, indeed, is necessary, in view of the many interjections - and I take it that the Minister was dealing with one line of steamers called the Austral line, and pointing out that those vessels were already equipped with wireless. I apprehend that the Minister was about to show that other vesselsof similar description were not so equipped but would have to be under the amendment. The Minister is in order. </para>

            <para>- The assistance offered is such as I can well afford to do without. There are, perhaps, hundreds of vessels trading to Australia with crews of from twenty to nearly fifty, and not one of these; under the original Act, is called upon to install wireless apparatus. The principle which was laid down in the principal Act was that there must be a limit beyond which it is inadvisable to proceed. The position, roughly; is that the Government feelthat they should endeavour as far as possible to insure that ships trading along the Australian coast shall be equipped with wireless apparatus. It is obvious, however, that we cannot insist  upon wireless being installed upon all vessels. When the Leader of the Oppositon (Mr; Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs, and was charged with the duty of piloting the Navigation Bill through this Chamber, it was thought that a vessel carrying fifty persons should be regarded as the smallest vessel upon which wireless should be installed. Personally, I think that that limit is too high. The Government, therefore, propose to grant a further measure of protection to our seafaring men. Under this Bill there are many hundreds of sailors who will be trading along our Australian coast, and who will be adequately protected by the installation of wireless, but who were not similarly protected under the Act which  i9  already upon our statute-book. As the ordinary hour for adjournment has been reached, and as I shall probably have a further opportunity of addressing the Committee on this matter, I do not intend to unduly trespass upon the time of honorable members at this juncture. Although I have been on my feet for perhaps half-an-hour, I have not&#39; succeeded in making a five-minutes speech. </para>
