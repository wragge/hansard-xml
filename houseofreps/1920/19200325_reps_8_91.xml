          <para>. - (By <inline font-style="italic">leave).</inline> - Pursuant to the decision of . the House the other evening, the Government has taken steps to adjust the price and  re-arrange  the conditions, as from to-day, under which sugar is sold, and I desire to state  for  the information  of  honorable members and of the public exactly what has been done. I may preface my remarks by saying that, owing to the high price of foreign sugar,  we  have been losing &#163;20,000 a day by retailing sugar at 3&#189;d . per lb . Obviously  we  cannot continue to  do  this, and neither ought the people&#39; to permit its continuance. For, while the public have been buying sugar at 3&#189;d. per lb., as taxpayers they must make good the loss of 2&#189;d. We propose, therefore, to increase, as from today, the retail price of sugar from 3&#189;d. to 6d. per lb.  Before  dealing with the new prices and arrangements, I may remind the House of  the  conditions which prevailed under the old agreement. Hitherto the rate for 1A sugar per ton has been, in Queensland and New South Wales, &#163;29 5s.; in Victoria, &#163;29 7s. 6d.; in South Australia, &#163;29 15s..; and at Fremantle, in Western Australia, &#163;3015s. It is proposed now to substitute for these rates a uniform rate of &#163;49. Thus the wholesale price of 1A sugar will henceforth be &#163;49 per ton in all the capital cities of the five States and inFremantle, Western Australia, less a maximum discount of 5 per cent., or &#163;2 9s., making the net amount received by the Commonwealth Government &#163;46 lis. per ton. The retail grocer will buy his sugar at &#163;49 per ton, less a minimum discount of 3 per cent., or &#163;1 9s. 5d., the net cost of the sugar to him being &#163;47 10s. 7d. Selling it at 6d. per lb., he will realize &#163;56 per ton, and make a profit of &#163;8 9s. 5d. per ton, which is equal to over 16 per cent, on the turnover, and nearly 18 per cent, on the cost. Some general observations on the figures I have quoted may be of interest to honorable members. In the first place, the maximum discount has been reduced from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent. Under the old agreement the discount to wholesalers was 6 per cent., subjectto a rebate to the retailer equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent., leaving them with 3^ per cent. On the same basis they now receive a net discount of 2&#163; per cent. The grocer under the former arrangement sold at a profit of &#163;4 0s. 6d. per ton, according to his calculation, or of &#163;4 4s. 6d. per ton, according to our calculation; his profit will now be &#163;8 9s. 5d. per ton. Protests were received from grocers throughout Australia to the effect that they were being asked to sell sugar at a price that was unprofitable to them. To meet the case, the Government have increased their profit to &#163;8 9s. 5d. per ton. The Grocers&#39; Association is not satisfied with the proposed arrangement, but asks for a 20 per cent, profit. To that, however, we cannot agree. The grocers have been treated very fairly under the new agreement&#93; which allows them to make :twice as much profit as under the old agreement. Furthermore, as we do not charge for the bags in which the sugar is carried, although 70-lbs bags cost ls. each, and sacks ls. 3d. each; the grocer oan increase his profit by 16s. per ton by selling the bags, secondhand, for 6d. each, and the sacks for ls. each, making his gross profit &#163;9 5s. 5d. per ton. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I direct attention now to another alteration made by the Government, which, I hope, will meet with the approval of this House. Under the former agreement retailers were not permitted to buy direct from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. It is now proposed that any grocer. may buy a ton of sugar or more, subject to the same conditions as a whole- saler. He will be entitled to precisely the same discount as the wholesaler, and, so far as I know, there is no insuperable obstacle to his dealing direct. The amount of  finance  involved is not great. A ton of sugar costs &#163;49, and the retailer  has  seven days in which to sell that quantity and pay  the  Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

            <para>- Exactly the same as a wholesaler; all persons will be treated alike. The discount is, I understand, granted upon a seven-day credit. The amount of discount depends upon the quantity purchased, but the point is that the same discount will be given to the retailer as to the wholesaler. I think the proposal is fair, and I hope this House will support tha Government in its action. As far as it has the power to do so, the Govern-&#39; ment is desirous of .preventing any act in restraint of trade. It is necessary to emphasize that the increase in the price of sugar to 6d. is mainly due, not to the contract made  with &#39; the Queensland Government for purchase at &#163;30 6s. 8d., but to the high price of at least 100,000 tons of foreign sugar which we have bought, or shall be obliged to buy, to cover the deficiency of local sugar that will exist at the end of the coming season. This is . the main cause of the increase, and I hope that the  pre3S,  which criticises the action of the Government in having, made a firm agreement for a period of .years for the purpose of encouraging a great Australian industry, will not condemn the contract as one which will have the effect of exploiting the consumer. If it were not for this contract it would be impossible to sell foreign sugar under 8d. or 9d. per lb.- </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I will now read the two regulations which have been framed for the purpose of at once protecting the consumer and of fixing - as far as we are able to&#62; do so - the price of sugar-. The first has been made under the War Precautions Act, and reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Regulation 49e of the War Precautions Regulations, amended to this date, shall not apply to sugar purchased from the Commonwealth, whether hy the vendor or by any other person, after the date of the making of this regulation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>In plain English, that means that the only regulation made under the War Precautions Act has been for the purpose of repealing the existing regulation under the War Precautions Act. The regulation fixing the price has been framed under the Commercial Activities (Sugar) Regulations, issued pursuant to the Commercial Activities (Sugar) Act passed last year. It reads as follows: - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">

            <para>These regulations maybe cited as the Commercial Activities (Sugar) Regulations. </para>

          <item label="2.">
            <para>For the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 7 of the Commercial Activities Act 1919, the prescribed price at which sugar of the grade known as 1A may be sold, is6d. per lb., plus such sum as represents the cost incurred by the vendor in respect of the delivery of the sugar to him. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="3.">
            <para>Any person who, without the consent in writing of the Treasurer, sells or offers for sale any such sugar at a greater price than the price fixed by the last preceding regulation shall be guilty of an offence. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="4.">
            <para>These regulations do not authorize the sale at a higher price than 3&#189;d. per lb., plus such sum as represents the cost incurred by the vendor in respect of the delivery of the sugar to him, of any sugar purchased from the Commonwealth, whether by the vendor or by any other person, on or before the date of the making of these regulations. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I will now explain very briefly the meaning of these regulations. Clause 1 recites the authority under which the regulations are made. Clause 2 simply repeats the verbiage of the present regulation and will have the effect of preventing sugar being sold at a higher sum than 6d. per lb. in any of the capital cities of the Commonwealth, except Perth, exactly as the similar regulation under the War Precautions Act prevented a person from selling sugar at more than 3&#189;d. in the capital cities. Clause 3 requires no explanation. Clause 4 relates to sugar already in the hands of persons who have purchased at3&#189;d., and it prohibits the sale of such sugar at a higher price than 3&#189;d. The Premiers of the various States have been informed of what the Commonwealth Government intends to do. They have been asked to support the Government by issuing regulations, or taking such other action as may be deemed necessary to prevent the exploitation of the public, both in regard to sugar and to jam, confectionery, and condensed milk, the sugar contents of which have been purchased at 3&#189;d. In the State of Victoria, as I think honorable members are aware, such action is being taken, and I apprehend it will be taken in every State. The Commonwealth clearly has power to deal with sugar itself, but, in my opinion, sugar already sold - now the property of other persons, and forming one of the main ingredients of such commodities as jam, confectionery and condensed milk - is outside the direct control of the Commonwealth ; and the public must look to the States for such protection as the Commonwealth cannot give. At the same time, the Commonwealth will give every protection in its power. </para>

              <para>- I did not know until the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> rose that he intended to make a Ministerial statement in regard to the price of sugar. This is an important question to the consumers of sugar in Australia. As I pointed out last week on the AddressinReply, an extra1d. per lb. means an additional outlay by thepeople of Australia of &#163;2,600,000. I am not quite sure what proportion of sugar is consumed in the homes, and how much by the manufacturers of jam and confectionery, brewers, and so forth, though I believe brewers do not use relatively so much as do other manufacturers. I understand that about 60 per cent, is used in the homes and about 40 per cent, in manufacturing purposes. However, an increase of 2&#189;d. in the price, on the 280,000 tons which is the estimated amount consumed annually in Australia, means an extra outlay by the people of &#163;6,500,000, because they will pay the increase in any case. It is a serious matter to raise the priceof sugar to this amount. </para>

              <para>- Some factories have started in the last year, and other factories, which last vear used only, perhaps, half a ton a week, now employ five times the number of hands, and require five times the quantity of sugar. </para>

          <para>Like my right honorable friend the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> and many others, I have been to a party meeting this morning, and persons interested in sugar have not been able to get in touch with me; but in the short time that was available I had no fewer than four telephone calls from trade union officials and manufacturers, informing me that factories are closed&#39; owing to the lack of sugar. The average consumption per head of the population is rather more than 2 lb. per week, and an extra 2&#189;d.  will mean an increase in an average family of a husband, wife, and three children, of over 2s. per week. If the producers of sugar need this extra cost in order to provide fair and reasonable conditions of employment, there would not be so much to com,plain of. We must bear in mind that grocers, who we are told, are obtaining more sugar than others, will sell exactly the same quantity as before, only they will get nearly double the profit, or more. </para>

Some of these men were so upset at this that they had to go for a trip round the world in order to recover. I must say that I am a bit doubtful about the ruin such people allege they suffer. </para>

              <para>- We have heard &#39;much of those people, and, as has been said&#39; before, I suppose they sell below cost, and make their profit on the paper and string which they give away. . However, if the growers and the millers are to receive only Id. per lb., as the agreement provides, the public desire to know where the other  1&#189;d.  is going. Is it going to the refining company, or is it going to the distributors ? Is it going to the Government to balance the account? I know that the British Government have been subsidizing various industries, and I read the other day that they were paying &#163;25,000,000 to keep the bread at lOd. or ls. per loaf. </para>

              <para>- Whether it was &#163;50,000,000 or not, we are told that in the case of sugar we are losing &#163;20,000 per day, which means &#163;120.000 per week, or &#163;500,000 per month. How long has this been going on ? It has gone on only since the amount of sugar produced in Queensland last year has been in consumption. A lot of sugar was harvested last year in Queensland, and not converted from raws into refined, and I wish to know who will get the advantage. </para>

              <para>- The House has never yet learned the quantity of sugar that was purchased in Java on such favorable terms. In  July  or August last the Minister must have known how much we were short of sugar for the season. In the present month of March we cannot estimate what the crop will be for this season, but by August, when the growers commence to deliver at the mill, we ought to be able tj estimate within 10,000 or 20,000 tons what the shortage will be. Of course cyclones may come along and wipe out the crop, hut that is not the season when we may expect them. </para>

              <para>- I was fairly near the mark when I said that the shortage could be estimated within 20,000 tons, and in my opinion the Government should have provided for that contingency, at least to the extent of purchasing from overseas what Australia would require for the season ending in June next. The cost of living has become so high that the people will want to know why the Government did not make the necessary arrangements, and, furthermore, where the  2&#189;d.  per lb. is to go. They will want to know whether the people who are handling the sugar are not getting too much. The Government say that the consumers will have to pay 6d. per lb. to reimburse them for the loss now being sustained through purchases overseas, but this .loss could have been obviated if they had looked ahead. </para>

              <para>- I hope that it will not be dearer. I notice that four vessels are expected to arrive early next week with sugar from abroad. At the present time our industries are short of sugar, and cannot be kept going, and housewives cannot buy any at any price in the district where I live. I suppose they will be able to get it once the price goes un. but the people will naturally say that the sugar only came to hand when the price went up. A question was asked in another place recently in regard to another commodity, but dealing with&#39; the same aspect. People will say that these sugar vessels hung off the coast for the purpose of seeing whether the price would go up. </para>

              <para>- And I made it perfectly clear that every honorable member in the House would be with the right honorable gentleman in seeing that they were punished. However, by hoarding sugar, some manufacturers will be able to charge the public extra, because it would be impossible to follow the commodity once it is converted into jam. In the ordinary socalled 2-lb. tin of jam, which really con-_ tains not more than <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> lbs., there is at&#39; least 4 lb. of sugar; so that the increase In the price of each tin of jam will be fully 2d. By the time the jam is boiled and evaporation takes place, a certain amount of weight is lost. The grocer will demand his increased profit on jam as well as upon other commodities. I ask the Prime Minister to promise that as soon as the Australian crop is such as to allow a reduction in price the Government will bring about a reduction, so that the people will not continue to suffer from lack of foresight on the part of the Ministry  in  failing to import supplies when they were obtainable at a reasonable price, and  when  they knew what the shortage in the Queensland crop was likely to be. </para>

            <para>. - Last week I entered a protest against the House being called upon, practically at midnight, to deal with the contract entered into with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. In fairness to the House, when an important statement of this kind is contemplated by a Minister, copies of it should be issued an hour or two beforehand so that honorable members who are deeply interested in the subject may be able to grasp its full effect. This is one of the most important matters that we shall have to consider this session, and the proposal to practically double the price of sugar to the consumer will be viewed with the utmost concern. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> that we ought to know where the profits derived from the enhanced price are to go. The cane-grower is entitled to the full sympathy of Parliament, and he certainly has mine. The more I go into the matter the more convinced I am that the cane-growers have never had a fair share of the profit resulting from their labour, and never will have as long as we continue the present patch-work system. We have a right to know what increased return will be secured by the cane-grower as a result of this new arrangement. </para>

              <para>- Representatives of the cane-growers have interviewed me and have put their case before members of the party which I have the honour to lead. We, as a party, are satisfied that drastic steps will have to be taken to enable the cane-growers of Queensland to get a fair deal. This new agreement means that the people of Australia will pay something like &#163;15,750,000 per annum for their sugar. In view of the exceedingly high cost of living, and the fact that the prices of all commodities are steadily going up, this represents a very serious burden, and will bring sorrow upon the people. </para>

              <para>- The whole of our arrangements in regard to sugar supplies have been bungled for the last three or four years. A few months before the armistice was signed representations were made to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> that they could obtain in Java all the sugar they required at from &#163;7 to &#163;7 10s. per ton. They knew of the anticipated shortage in the Queensland crop, but they refused to buy then, and later had to import from 80,000 to 100,000 tons, at from &#163;20 to &#163;21 per ton. When these representations were made to them sugar was practically going to waste at our doors. The slightest foresight on the part of the Government should have led them to buy up the surplus for a couple of years. </para>

              <para>-Yes. I came over from Tasmania specially to put it before Ministers. Had they bought the sugar then, when they had the opportunity, in that one year alone they could have made a saving of &#163;1,500,000. If, as common foresight should have dictated, they had contracted for at least a twoyears&#39; supply they would have saved from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;5,000,000, or would have been able to give the people sugar at something like a reasonable price. </para>

              <para>- The result will not be so serious to the jam maker as to the small fruit grower. The Minister for Trade and Customs empowered one of his officers to make inquiries into the small fruit industry, and the report of that officer will show that it is impossible to grow small fruit under 3d. per lb. The grower cannot live on a return of less than 3d. perlb. We have been manufacturing jam on the dual basis of 3d. per lb. for fruit and 3d. per lb. for sugar. If the price of sugar is to be increased to 6d. per lb. I dread the effect upon the small fruit industry. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid it will. For some years I have held the view that the whole question of the position of the sugar industry should be grappled with. I speak as one who desires to help the sugar industry. It would be a calamity to Australia if an industry which gives employment to a large number of people in that part of Australia where we most need settlement were crippled. We shall put it on a firm basis only by encouraging a system of co-operation, backed by Government support, and ridding the industry of the incubus in the shape of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which &#39;has been penalizing it as far back as I can remember. </para>

              <para>- The same statement was made a few evenings ago, that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company paid a better price for cane than did the co-operative companies. A sugar-grower from the electorate of Wide Bay called me out of the chamber, and told me that the statement was false, and indicated where I could get printed evidence in support of his statement. In the hopeless and helpless condition into which we have been allowed to drift, I confess I cannot see any alternative to the agreement we have accepted. We can do nothing else, but my complaint is that this country should never have been allowed to drift into this position. Especially do I say that there was no possible excuse for the insertion in the agreement made between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments of a clause, the deliberate object of which was to prevent an extension of cane growing in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- i am informed that that is not correct. From the inception of Federation there has been an annual shortage of sugar. i stated last week that there had been a shortage in every year but one. i was immediately corrected, and told there had been a substantial surplus in one year, and in another year a bare margin above the requirements of the Australian people. Having that knowledge i cannot understand why, unless the Government were misled &#39;by those whose object it is to keep Australia always on the border-line between supply and demand, why that clause was inserted in the agreement, bearing in mind that its obvious intention was to prevent the extension of the cultivation of sugar.  We are paying to the sugar industry a bonus of &#163;6 per ton, which raises the price of the commodity to the public enormously, and the Commonwealth Parliament and people have a right to ask that an industry which is receiving such favorable consideration should at least produce enough sugar to supply local requirements. </para>

              <para>- of course it would not. i do not know one of the shareholders in the company; i know nothing about them personally, but having made a careful study of the sugar question i have always regarded the. Colonial Sugar Refining Company as the curse of the industry in Australia. Holding that view; i should not be the man I think I am if I had not the courage to express it. i repeat that in view of the heavy burden we are imposing . upon the people of Australia there should be an immediate attempt by the Government to see if it is not possible, &#60;by a thorough system of co-operation amongst the growers themselves, assisted by the Commonwealth, to place- the industry on a firm and substantial basis, so that those engaged in it may be able to operate it profitably to themselves,  and  at the same time supply the people of Australia with sugar at a fair and rea;sonable price. </para>

            <para>. - However we regard this agreement, it means the placing of an extra burden upon the people of at least &#163;5,000,000 per annum; indeed, it seems to be a new method of taxation. To most of the people the burden has already become too heavy, and I believe that if commodities continue increasing in price the people themselves will rise before long, and demand that steps be  taken to release them from the clutches of the exploiter. By this agreement we are looking three years ahead, and apparently we are to, proceed in the same haphazard fashion for that period as we have done during the last few years, and probably we shall be in a worse position three years hence than we are to-day. Parts of Australia are admirably adapted for the cultivation of the sugar-beet. If the Commonwealth Government were to take the sugar problem seriously in hand, in regard to the growing and treatment of both cane and beet sugar, we might, in two years&#39; time, be able to supply our own&#39; requirements. I find that in 1913-14 we produced 10,000 tons of sugar more than we consumed. For the next three years, the production was considerably less than the consumption; but in 1917-18, there was an excess of production of about 50,000 tons. Since that date, the Australian grower has nut been able to meet the local demand. From to-day, at any rate, the responsibility in regard to the sugar production and supply will rest, not only upon the Government, but upon every member of this Parliament, unless, we are prepared, at some early date, to take some decided steps that will lead to Australia becoming self-contained in respect of this important commodity. </para>

              <para>- The Government have been losing thousands of pounds per day in trying to provide our people with sugar at reasonable prices. Would it&#39; not be better to expend that money in trying to extend the cultivation of sugar cane and beet? There are two ways in which we can do that. If we cannot see our way clear to revive cane planting to an extent that will insure local requirements being supplied, what is there to prevent the Commonwealth Government, or the State Governments, or Federal and State Governments combined, doing something to stimulate the cultivation of beet sugar? It is estimated that the world&#39;s consumption of sugar is about 21,000,000 tons per annum; the estimated production in 1917-18 - the latest year for which particulars are available - was 17,556,000 tons. Those figures, which have been compiled by an expert, were published in the Victorian <inline font-style="italic">Journal of Agriculture.</inline> Whilst honorable members on different sides of the House - including the Prime Minister - have stated that there has been a decline in sugar production, this article shows that such has not been the case. Figures showing the world&#39;s production disclose the fact that during the currency of the war there was a considerable rise in the production of sugar. </para>

              <para>- The point I am making is that, instead of there having been a decline in the production of sugar, there has been at least no falling off in the production. In Australia we should do all we can to increase production. If three years hence we have 100,000 tons or 200,000 tons more than we need for our own requirements, we shall be in a better position than if we &#39;had then less than is sufficient for our needs. Whatever our political views, it is our bounden duty to increase the production of sugar in Australia, whether from cane or from beet. We must to-day be the laughing-stock of other peoples, seeing that we could produce our own requirements, but do not do so. </para>

            <para>.- It is amusing to hear the honorable member and others talk about the desirability of increasing the production of sugar, when we know that they are always leaving it to the other fellow to bring about the increase, and know nothing at all about the industry. Some time ago the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr.Ryan) made a statement, that was repeated by the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams),</inline> to the effect that the action of the Commonwealth Government in restraining the production of sugar had brought about the present scarcity of that article. I was one of those who waited on the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister in reference to this matter, and it was then pointed out that at that time there was a surplus of between 50,000 tons and 60,000 tons of sugar, and every prospect of that surplus being increased by the good season to come. But the good season did not follow, and the surplus was changed to a deficiency. The production of sugar has never been restrained in any sense of the word. The honorable member for West Sydney will know that the Invicta mill was moved into the Haughton district from further south during the time that he says restriction was in operation. </para>

              <para>- The Invicta mill was a white elephant, because there was not cane to supply it, and it was therefore moved to another district, where it could be used to better advantage; but every mill in Queensland could have crushed more cane than has been offering. Of course, there has been stand-over cane; but every year there is such cane, not because of the inability of the mills tocrush all the cane offering, but because of climatic conditions. When the season is late, the cane is slow in maturing to a proper density, and cannot be crushed until late in the year, and then the wet season may set in, and reduce the density too much to make the cane worth crushing. </para>

          <para>I have been as severe a critic of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company as any man in this House, and have never been a friend of the company, but to give it its due, I must say that the company has treated its cane-growers better than the Queensland Government has treated the growers who have supplied the Government mills. When, in 1918, a cyclone destroyed a great quantity of sugar, and practically ruined many plantations, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made a grant of, I understand, as much as &#163;400 to some of its cane suppliers, to re-establish them, but the Queensland Government did nothing of the kind. Furthermore, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company gave higher prices for the cane grown to supply their mills at Hambledon, Goondi, and, I believe, on the Herbert River than the Queensland Government gave to the growers who supplied the Government mills at Babinda and South Johnstone. In getting &#163;30 6s. 8d. for their sugar, the growers will be getting as much as they expected to get, and possibly more; but if Australia does not agree to pay that price, she will have to buy her sugar at a much higher price, and the growers will get still better terms. The trouble in the North has been, not with the growers, but with the workers. The honorable member for West Sydney, when Premier of Queensland, had considerable trouble with the workers of Northern Queensland. There was a strike on the railways, which he and his Government were afraid to tackle. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member may make his own explanations, but he knows that no action was taken by his Government in connexion with that strike. The Queensland Government, of which the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> was the head, had trouble on the railway also when they tried to send police to quell the disturbances at Townsville. These disturbances in the north have not been caused by the canegrowers; they have always been the victims of the workers. And the weak point in this agreement is that, no matter what may be the nature of its clauses, no matter what specific clauses may be inserted in any agreement or arrangement made with the Australian Workers Union, they will not control the men. They snap their fingers at their own organizations. </para>

              <para>- That may be so, but it does not affect the fact that as soon as this agreement is ratified, and crushing commences next season, the men will want a good &#34; cut &#34; of the added price. There may be awards; and some of the men may obey them, but that does not matter to the workers as a whole. The wage is 17s. a day, according to the award, but the award does not control output. Whether a man cuts his half a ton or 2 tons a day , he gets his 17s. ; but it is nearly all done by piece-work. The  chairman  of the shire council at Port Douglas told me that he had had a gang cutting cane, and that an inspector had notified him that he would have to turn out more cane. That is to say, he would have to put on more cane-cutters. So he took on two extra men, but their union organizer came along. The employer had been giving 9s. a ton for cutting, but the union official told him he would have to pay these extra men at the rate of 13s. They would not begin work until they got that amount, so the employer was forced to pay the two at the rate of 13s. per ton. So soon as they received that wage all the rest of the cane-cutters demanded the same; and they got it. Sometimes curious things happen in the cane country, Generally, purely by accident, of course, a fire-stick gets into the cane if the price demanded by the men is not paid. The cane must then be cut within a given time or it will ferment, after which it will not be worth cutting. I know of an instance where a man  was  offering &#163;1 a ton to get his burnt cane cut, but the men, who knew full well the urgency of his requirements, demanded &#163;2 a ton. That is the way they will deal with this agreement, notwithstanding whatever the executive of the Australian Workers Union may say or do. The men have said openly that they have no time for Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts. The South Johnstone mill is a very fine institution ; it is a Government mill, well managed; but the trouble is that the manager really has no control at all. The individual who rules there is  -  I was told when in the district - a cook&#39;s mate. When any trouble breaks out he wires down to the Treasurer, and the deadlock is settled in the way in which the cook&#39;s mate desires. So far as the situation at Babinda is concerned, the hotel is an exceedingly fine place; it cost about &#163;24,000 without its furniture. The manager, who is the right man in the right place, told me that employees in the district could get board and lodging for 30s. a week. That being so, where does the high cost of living come in ? </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his seat has made observations many of which are inaccurate, while some of them, in addition, are quite irrelevant. I think I can claim, notwithstanding his assertions to have been the head of a Government which did more for the sugar growers and sugar workers of Queensland than did any other Government in the history of the State. I can also speak with knowledge of the circumstances under which the sugar agreement was entered upon in 1918. When previously speaking in this Chamber, I referred to the fact that the Commonwealth Government had insisted on the insertion of a clause in that agreement with the Queensland Government - but inserted under protest by the Queensland Government - which prevented the extension of the milling capacity in that State during the currency of the agreement. I asserted then, and emphatically repeat now, that the clause was included at the behest of the Commonwealth Government, in order to prevent the production of sugar increasing in Queensland. If there had been any doubt upon the matter, it is at once removed by the fact that the negotiations, as far as they are relevant to my statement, are in writing, and so cannot be contradicted. The clause to which I refer  sets  forth - </para>

You stipulate that we must not during the currency of the agreement, allow any alteration enlargement, or extension of any sugar mill, so as to increase its capacity. That condition will have the effect of preventing a number of mill-owners from increasing efficiency of their mills, and thus prevent them from being in a position to pay as high a price for cane as other more highly improved mills. You further stipulate that you will not allow any alteration of Sugar Cane Prices Act during currency of agreement. By this embargo you will prevent Queensland Parliament from making effective cane price legislation, which was designed to protect growers from exploitation at hands of proprietary millers. The Act at present requires amendment, to prevent certain large millers from evading its provisions. However, the mills are crushing, and sugar must be disposed of, so we have no alternative, and must accept your terms, but I urge you to give further consideration to these important matters.

              <para>- The Minister may do so; but here it is in writing. Can he get away from it? Here it is in black and white that the Commonwealth Government, and the Minister for Trade and Customs particularly and individually, were most insistent upon the insertion of this clause. The Minister seemed to know a great deal about the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. No doubt it was in the refiners&#39; interests that the clause had been drafted for insertion in the agreement. Not only that, but the Commonwealth Government insisted that no alteration should be made in Queensland legislation, which had been designed for the protection of the growers as  against the millers. It is regrettable that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should have been allowed to secure agreements between the growers in Queensland and some party who lives outside of that State who is not agrower. These agreements were for the purpose of selling their cane to this person, and then for a re-sale to be made from that buyer - who is outside the jurisdiction of Queensland - to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company&#39;s mills, in order that the company should be in a position to avoid the necessity for paying the prices for cane which had been fixed by the Sugar Cane Prices Boards under the Queensland Cane Prices Act. Now that is something which the Commonwealth Government have permitted!, and will the honorable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bamford)</inline> or the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> deny it? </para>

              <para>- No; the growers wanted the Sugar Cane Prices Act, and they wanted it without any fettering, and they wanted the prices which Had been fixed by the Cane Prices Boards under the Act. In my opinion, what we have heard from the Prime Minister this afternoon - namely, that sugar is to be raised to 6d. per lb. as from to-day - is an illustration of the incapacity and bungling of the Government as administrators in the past. It shows also that they have not been candid with the publics - that there has been a suppression of the real facts. How long has all this been going on? How long have we been losing &#163;20,000 a day? Why were the people not told all the facts when the election campaign was on in December last ? They were told there would not be a rise in the price of sugar; but it was then, no doubt, the intention of the Government to make a rise such as has been announced this afternoon - a rise which will have the effect of compensating them- as interjected by the honorable member for Nepean <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> - for what they have already expended in respect of sugar. </para>

              <para>- That it would make up for what the Government have lost before to-day? The Government should represent the people of Australia, and no doubt the expense will eventually fall on the people. If I had my way, when a sudden temporary rise of this sort is made - a rise which falls particularly on the workers with large families - I would rather place the burden upon the shoulders of the taxpayers generally. The method adopted by the Government means taxing the poor people with large families instead of, as the much fairer way, placing the burden on the whole community. The method of the Government of meeting the situation gives opportunity for profiteering. I do not care what precautions are taken, or what precautions the Government allege they are going to take, to prevent profiteering, the inevitable result of this rise in price will be that, in the case of stocks of sugar already obtained at a cheap rate, and in respect of confectionery and other commodities made from such sugar, there will be profiteering. There is no doubt that jam made from sugar purchased before the rise will be sold at a higher price, and that profiteering will go on. </para>

              <para>- I am pleased to hear the Leader of the Country party support what I am saying. I was glad to hear the Prime Minister say that this rise in price is not due to the last agreement. I am quite satisfied that the Queensland Government would not insist on a price that would be too high or unjust so far as the grower is concerned. But there are portions of the agreement which do not altogether meet with my approval, and I  doubt whether they would even meet with the approval of the Queensland GovernmentI refer to the charges paid to the refiners and also to the millers. This is a matter which should be reviewed very carefully indeed, before coming to a final opinion, I should like an opportunity to peruse every clause in this agreement, and to carefully study the statement which the Prime Minister has made this afternoon. I agree with the Leader of the Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mc Williams)</inline> that more time should be allowed for the consideration of an important statement of this kind. Under present circumstances it is assumed, subsequently, that every member agrees with the proposals of the Prime Minister ; but we should be given a full and fair opportunity of perusing all the clauses and of coming to a deliberate opinion. This sort of agreement should not be allowed to go forth, or be binding, without the approval of Parliament. The Prime Minister, it appears to me, brings down some agreements which he asks Parliament to approve in a hurry ; but there are other agreements which he makes without reference to Parliament, merely informing us of the fact, as he has done this afternoon. As I understand the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, the proposal is to raise the price of sugar with or without our approval. This the Government have decided to do, and, in my opinion, they have decided on a method which, as I say, shows their bungling incapacity. It is a method not calculated to meet the situation, which they have allowed to arise, in a way that it ought to be met, in the circumstances. So far as I am concerned, I shall leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to remove the present Government from office, even if that be done on a motion of this sort. We ought to have Ministers in control of the Treasury benches who are able to clean out the Augean stable, and let us. have a real, straight look at how the affairs of the country stand. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> stated that under the agreement the Queensland Government were not to extend or allow the extension of sugar plant during its currency. To that statement I do not object; but the honorable member should have given the House the whole facts, which I, myself, know from A to Z. When I applied to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> to enter into this agreement early in 1918, I had before me figures supplied by  Colonel Oldershaw,  showing that there was then at least six months&#39; surplus sugar in hand, and that was so in June, 1918. So far as my recollection goes, this represented somewhere about &#163;6,000,000; and  Colonel Oldershaw  was afraid, and the Government were afraid, that if they entered into a two or three years&#39; agreement they might be landed with another surplus of six months&#39; supply, aggregating twelve months, which would not be to the interests of the Commonwealth. I tried to persuade them all I could that such a thing was not likely to happen. They then decided to make an agreement for two years, but desired to make some other restrictions in it, but I persuaded them not to do so. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> asked me whether there was any objection to restricting the construction of more machinery; and I replied that, so far as private enterprise was concerned, no man would be such a damned fool as to put more machinery into the industry under present conditions, and that, so far as the Queensland Government was concerned, I thought it had advanced quite enough to satisfy itself. However, the Treasurer insisted on the clause, and, of course, he had the right to do so. I think that the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> would have been only just if he had stated what subsequently took place, as appears on the records of this Parliament. Shortly after this agreement was entered into, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he would still insist on the clause to which I have referred. The reply of the Minister was &#34;No&#34;; and he said that if the Queensland Government approached the Government to get permission to allow further plant to be constructed, or any alterations to be made to plant, it would not be withheld under the altered conditions. The altered conditions were, as I have pointed out, that in the coming season there was no further chance of any surplus. The answer I received to my question was sent to the sugar districts of Queensland in order to let those interested know that if they desired to extend their plant they&#39; could do so. I know that a plant was allowed to be moved from Bundaberg to the north, and re-erected there, without any objection being taken. </para>

              <para>- What the Queensland Government attempted was a scandal. The farmers, after experiencing cyclones, in which their buildings were, in many cases, nearly destroyed, some of them completely, and their crops blown .out of the ground, necessitating replanting, approached the mill-owners, who said they would advance money for two years if the farmers  would give them an agreement for that period to supply their cane at current prices. When the farmers went down as a deputation to the Queensland Government to ask permission to enter into such an agreement, the Minister for Agriculture turned down the proposal, and told them that if the refusal rained them, it could not even then be allowed. </para>

              <para>- I have the facts from the farmers themselves, and they came down to see the Prime Minister about the matter. When such an  advantageous  offer is submitted as that the rates shall be the current rates, and that there shall be no call for a single penny return out of the first year&#39;s crop, but only out of the second year&#39;s, why should it be turned down? Why should the farmers not. have a chance to replant and reerect their buildings ? That is enough on that score. </para>

              <para>- It is quit* accurate, as I can prove to the hilt. It has been suggested that I am advocating the interests of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; but, as a matter of fact, I have no interest whatever in that company. When I read in the report of the Royal Commission, brought into existence by a Labour Government, a statement to the effect that, instead of interfering with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, it was in the interests of the community to allow it to conduct the business, and when I read in the report of the latest Royal Commission, just now tabled, that the Colonial Sugar RefiningCompany pays a higher price for cane than either the Queensland Government mills or the Central mills, somebody has to convince me that the company is the enemy of the grower. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It has been stated in the public press that, after this agreement was entered into, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, stated that his company had not made 3 per cent, profit on their agreement. Of course, it may be said that it is easy for the representative of the company to make a statement of that kind ; but we must remember that the Auditor-General&#39;s officers audit every transaction of the Commonwealth Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and that such a statement, if not true, is not likely from a man who has any respect for his own word. Under these circumstances, we have the fact that sugar was handled under the agreements- at far less than it could have been by any other company. We have also to remember that when the company was prepared to enter into an arrangement like this with the Government, neither the millers nor the growers objected, showing that the men most interested were satisfied that it was the best under all the circumstances  ; but the price was the trouble. I wish to impress on honorable members that no blame should be attached to the Government in connexion with the agreement, in view of the fact that the Government were faced with a surplus of six months&#39; supply from the  previous  - season.. I pointed out that the reason for this was, largely, that in the previous year -the notorious Dickson award had come into effect. </para>
          <para>Many of the cane-growers would not cut- their cane under that award, so it was held over till the next season and created the surplus. It is all very well for the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> to say that sugar could have been bought in Java at &#163;7 per ton. The price was never lower than &#163;15 per ton, and, besides, there were no ships to take  it away. Furthermore, the price was low in Java simply because there were no vessels prepared to take it away, and there was np Government handling the crop or financing the growers, as the Commonwealth Government have handled the sugar crop here, and financed the growers of the Commonwealth. As soon as the armistice was signed, and ships were allowed to go to Java, the Javanese growers secured the world&#39;s parity. It is also all very well for honorable members to say that the sugar production of the world approximates the consumption, when we have it on the authority of the representative of the Cuban Government, who was sent to Europe to obtain statistical information, that the shrinkage of beet sugar production is about 4,500,000 tons, or practically 55 per cent.,  in  comparison with pre-war years. Where is that shortage to be made up in a year or two? Some honorable members object to the fact that the agreement is to cover a period of three years, but let them bear in mind that an arrangement for three years is necessary in order to encourage men to put more land under cane. Even now,  if  they put more land under cane this year, they will only have two crops during the currency of the agreement. </para>

              <para>- In 1917, I endeavoured to have the price raised to &#163;22 7s., and I believe that if the growers had been offered that price, and the agreement had been made for five years, there would have been such an extension of the industry that the full requirementsof Australia would have been supplied, and- we should not have been purchasers of sugar abroad at a landed cost of &#163;81 per ton. The rate of exchange to be  paid is  20 to 25 per cent., and when insurance and freight are added it will be seen that sugar cannot be landed in Australia today at less than &#163;81 per ton. If the agreement is not entered into, what will be the result? The cane-growers and the mills will produce sugar, and put it on the market at the world&#39;s parity - they will be just as free to do it as are butter producers, or producers of other commodities - and our jam factories will be obliged to pay anything from 9d. to lOd. per lb. . They will be deprived of the advantage they have over outside competitors, who cannot get sugar at anything approaching 6d. per lb. Is that the desire of honorable members who oppose this agreement? The arrangement entered into is good for the consumers, and good for the manufacturers of jams and confectionery, and it is fair for the cane-grower, the sugar refiner, and the labourer of Queensland. </para>

First, then, as to the agreement itself. No more eloquent tribute could be paid to the agreement which the Government have made with the Queensland Government and all the parties concerned than that no one in the House has condemned it. </para>

              <para>- But it is alleged by irresponsible persons - irresponsible because upon their shoulders rests no responsibility - that the Government could have foreseen the conditions that exist in the world to-day, and have provided against them. It is alleged that the Government are responsible for the fact that the people of Australia are to-day asked to pay 6d. per lb. for sugar, and that had they been gifted with that clairvoyant vision of the future, which is the privilege of certain honorable members, they could have avoided it by buying sugar at &#163;7 10s. a ton and storing it here against the wrath that was to come. Let me deal with this point. In 1917-18 the Government had a surplus of sugar, but it was destroyed by a great cyclone, which cost the Government &#163;250,000. At least that was the sum which the Government paid by way of compensation to the unfortunate sugar-growers whose crops were devastated. Is it contended that we could have foreseen that cyclone? Passing on to the latter part of 1918, it is alleged that we could have foreseen the end of the war. Is there any one here who did foresee the end of it? There are plenty who prayed for it, but none of us foresaw it, except, perhaps, the honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams),</inline> who, we are told, came all the way from Tasmania to tell the Ministry that the end of the war, or of the world, was approaching, and that they ought to buy  sugar. He says we ought to have foreseen the end of the war, and that we could have bought sugar at &#163;7 a ton. But he did not tell us, and he cannot tell us, how it was that when sugar was, as he says, &#163;7 per ton, America, Great Britain, and all the countries in the world were paying a much higher price for their sugar than the Australian consumer, although we had to pay &#163;21 for our supplies. Here was sugar which, according to the honorable member, was to be had almost for the asking, yet America was paying 5&#189;d. and 6d. per lb., and Great Britain still more. How did this state of affairs come about? Why did not the authorities in the United States of America and Britain buy this very cheap sugar ? Was it not owing to the fact that the sugar lying in Java could not be shipped for love nor money? The position of the Javanese sugar-growers was very much the same as that of the Australian wheat-growers, who were glad to accept 4s. 9d. per bushel for their wheat because they could not get more, and do not make half the noise that the honorable member does because we did not see that which could not be foreseen. The honorable member says we ought to have bought cheap -sugar. But that is the very thing we did do! It may be that honorable members are not aware of the fact, although the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> has referred to it, that we did buy cheap sugar, though not in exactly the quantities indicated or at the price mentioned. We bought a lot of cheap sugar, and the people of this country have been eating it for many months, and have thus had the cheapest sugar in the world. But it has now all been eaten. The jam-makers of this country have been able to extend their business enormously owing to the fact that, through the action of the Government, they have had the cheapest sugar in the world. If any one has a right to be satisfied with regard to what the Government have done in regard to sugar it is the small fruit-growers and jam-makers. It is sufficient answer to the criticism of the Government in this connexion to say that we now export ten times as much jam as was exported before the war. The price of sugar has now to be increased to 6d., because it is&#39; impossible to buy the commodity abroad at less than &#163;80 per ton, more or less, and we have exhausted all the cheap sugar we purchased. The honorable member for Franklin says that the agreement is the best we could do in the circumstances, but that we ought to have foreseen the increase of prices. I have set out the facts; they speak for themselves. Any one who could have foreseen the end of the war does not deserve merely to be Prime Minister, but is destined for a very much higher position. We could not foresee the end of the war.. We could not foresee the disastrous cyclone or the shortage due to drought. Two months before the news of the Armistice came upon us the Imperial Cabinet was discussing the 1919 and 1920 campaigns, so that the wisdom of the world at that time was in darkness on matters which the honorable member for Franklin foresaw so plainly. </para>

          <para>For the first time the people of this country have had put before them quite clearly where every penny they pay for sugar will go. They know how much the grower the worker, the miller, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company will get. They know, too, how much the wholesale houses and the grocers will get; but they do not know what the share of the Government willbe. The Government will get what is left, and if the people work out the figures they will see that it will amount to very little. We do not know what we will have to pay for sugar at the end of the year any more than we could foresee the vagaries of the Queensland crop. If it had not been six weeks late, we would have been very many thousands, perhaps a million, pounds in pocket. Had the estimate of the 1919 crop not been too high, we would have been in a much better position. But all these things are not only beyond the control of Governments, but of mortals generally. We cannot help the position. But I say to the people of this country that if the price of foreign sugar drops, the consumers will get the benefit of the reduction directly. There will be no margin except the mere margin of overhead administrative expenses for the Government. The whole of the profit on this deal goes to the encouragement of one of the great industries of Australia. Surely in this matter we can put on one side all party political considerations and look at the agreement fairly. The best assurance the fruit-grower can have is that he will get his sugar for his jam at a price which is 2d. or 3d. per lb. less than what he would be called upon to pay if there were no agreement. I invite the House, even at this eleventh hour, if it likes to vote against the agreement by voting for the motion for the adjournment of the House to do so - and I ask the honorable member for Franklin to be one of those to call for a division - and if having the whole of the information at the disposal of the Government before them, honorable members elect to reject the agreement, the responsibility will rest, not on the Government, but on the House. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>On the l0th November, 1916, regulations were made under the War Precautions Act providing, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that a mortgagee shall not, without leave of the Court, call up or demand payment from a mortgagor of the principal sum secured by a mortgage, or exercise any power of sale or take steps for foreclosure. </para>
            <para>Had not subsequent action been taken, these regulations would have terminated on the ex piration of the War Precautions Act, and mortgage debts, the repayment of which had been postponed by the regulations, would have become repayable simultaneously upon the date of such expiration. </para>
            <para>In 1919 it was decided to amend the regulations to provide for a sliding scale in relation to the dates upon which the mortgage debts should fall due. The mortgage debts which, under the scale, were first repayable, were those the repayment of which had been longest postponed by the regulations. </para>
            <para>The amending regulations were made on the 4th June, 1919, and provided, by regulation 13, that a mortgage which, apart from moratorium, fell due prior to 1st January, 1915, should be repayable in August, 1919. Mortgages falling due at various dates subsequent to 1st January, 1915, and prior to 30th June, 1919, were made repayable on a corresponding date between August, 1919, and May, 1920. Mortgages falling due after the 1st July, 1919, and prior to the termination of the war, as declared by proclamation, were made repayable in June, 1920. </para>
            <para>As it was considered that the War Precautions Act might expire prior to the dates fixed for repayments, as set out above, a Bill was submitted to Parliament providing that the regulations should continue in force until the latest date for repayments fixed by the sliding scale. This Bill, which is now the Moratorium Act 1919, contained the whole of the moratorium regulations in a schedule, and became law on the 3rd September, 1919. </para>
            <para>When the Bill was before Parliament it was considered by members that the first date fixed for repayment by the sliding scale (regulation 13) was too early, and amendments were madeboth in the regulations and in the Bill, so that the dates for repayment of mortgages are now as follow: - </para>

          <para>The regulations also contain a provision whereby a Court may, in cases of hardship, extend the prescribed dates for repayment for a period not exceeding twelve months. </para>
          <para>It will be seen that the period within which repayments are to be made, as prescribed by regulation 13, is now running. </para>

          <para class="block">The third paragraph in this motion is now unnecessary, since, by the rules of the House, I am permitted to submit the whole question for discussion to-day. I had hoped that the Government, which is almost wholly dominated by the Nationalist party, would make the referendum and initiative a plank of their platform. The Nationalist Association in Victoria has adopted the principle, and also that of the recall, whilst that great organization, the Australian Natives Asosciation, which did more to bring about Federation than did any other, has time after time urged its adoption. It has for many years been a plank of the party to which I have the privilege to belong, and the principle of the recall has been made a plank in the platforms of two State Labour parties. With such a combination one might reasonably have expected the Government to take this matter in hand. By the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> more than by any combination of newspapers, the public of Australiahas been educated on this subject. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has unceasingly urged the passing of legislation to give effect to these principles, and one of its chief arguments has been that practically from the inauguration of this Parliament the people outside have been fooled by it. In every new Parliament there has been a majority of members pledged to a Protectionist policy; but only to-day have we before us a Tariff which it is suggested may be up to date. Heaven only knows how much longer we should have had to wait but for outside circumstances, and for the growing public opinion that either the Parliament has become an effete institution or we, the created thing, will not give our creators, the people, fair play. I have only to remind honorable mem bers of the awful indictment of the Government made to-day by the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> in regard to the sugar question. If the people outside had the control of Parliament, as they should have, they would not allow the Legislature to continue fooling with this question as we have done. Not only the general public, but the men who fought to retain our liberties, and the women and children who lost their breadwinners at the Front, are being robbed by the profiteering that is rampant to-day. Sugar is a necessity of life; it is one of the best foods we have, and the intentional reduction of the output was an infamy. I wish the people outside had the power of recall. There  is  nothing to be found in nature, science, or literature analogous to the position this Parliament occupies. God Himself has never made anything more powerful than He is. No man has invented anything which cannot be equalled or counteracted by the invention of some other man. Why should Parliament be the only created thing which, being elected on one day in every three years, becomes superior to its creators, and can do anything it chooses to them ? Why should not they, the creators, have controlling power over the created thing, not for one day in every three years, but for every month and! every year that Parliament exists? If that were done we should soon dispose of the absurdity of having six State Governors. What good do they do? Has any man who has ever attended the splendid entertainments at Government House seen a hungry man or woman at the festive board ? I have seen lots of robbers of the people there. I have enjoyed a good meal at Government House, I admit, but I abhor the frippery and nonsense. The predecessor of the present Governor General would not grant the present Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> a double dissolution because there was no precedent to guide him. He was recalled, and the present occupant of that office was appointed in his stead. The people of Australia, who pay for everything, including the salaries of the policeman and the GovernorGeneral alike, had no say in the matter. I propose to read one little quotation to show what has been achieved in Switzerland, which is known as &#34; the school house of Europe&#34; - a little land embosomed in the Alps, where three different nationalities live in harmony, although the homelands from which those  nationalities sprang were recently embroiled  in  that form of wholesale murder which is called war. There the Frenchman, the German, and the Italian will each fight for his beloved country against all others. The three nationalities are able to live in peace, because the laws of Switzerland are founded upon justice, and not upon fraud and chicanery. The reason for that is that the people have control of the Parliament under the twenty-six different forms of government that are utilized in the twenty-four cantons, half cantons, and the Federal Government. The thirty-seven Governments that were signatories to &#39;the Geneva Convention paid Switzerland the honour of deciding that the symbol of the Red Cross throughout the world should be the shield of Switzerland with the colours reversed. No decent, self-respecting enemy or belligerent ever fires intentionally upon that flag. Switzerland is the home of the bureau system, out of which was evolved universal postage, the parcels post, and other services which are managed from the International Bureau in that country by the unanimous desire of the civilized nations which contribute to its upkeep. The Government of Switzerland conceived the idea of bestriding the great continents of Europe and America by sending an agent to establish a branch of the bureau in the &#34;United States of America. The highest salary to be paid to one officer in &#34;Washington was &#163;400, and the other expenses would not have been great, because the Swiss Consulate in Washington would have provided office accommodation. I think that enterprise should have been carried out. At any rate, I would have voted for it had I been a member of the Swiss Parliament. But the Swiss people had not been consulted, a petition for a referendum was immediately drawn up, the scheme was re  jected,  and the officer was withdrawn from the United States of America. Had the people of Australia been possessed of the same power, I wonder if the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> would have been allowed to go to Europe to instruct that civilian soldier (General Monash), the greatest general that Australia has produced, how to organize and manage soldiers! The absurdity  of such a mission being undertaken by a man who had never managed anything! Never before have I heard of a man being retained in a high position for spending &#163;60,000 on a phantom regiment. The same Minister dismissed upwards of 2,000 brave men in New South Wale3 who had volunteered to go to the Front, but who made a fuss because they resented the action of Major-General McCay in increasing their hours of drill and shortening their leave. Instead of sending them to the Front immediately the Minister for Defence discharged them from the Australian Imperial Force, and a few months afterwards he was yelling for recruits. </para>
          <para>If the- United States of America be divided into two equal parts by a perpendicular line, there is not on the western side one State that has not the referendum, initiative, and. recall in some shape or form, whilst on the eastern side, which comprises the older settled parts of the Union, all the States but two operate the principle in some form. The old insult that used to be hurled at the United States of America with more or less truth that it was the home of bribery and corruption is ceasing to be true, for graft is being absolutely eliminated from no less than 457 cities, which are being managed and controlled by Commissioners who are subject to recall. I have always found that a person who is given a fair chance would rather be&#39; honest than dishonest, and the reputed dishonesties in the cities of America were due to the fact that the public officers were controlled by the big Trusts and Combines, and were not permitted to go straight. To-day corruption is being eliminated from municipal life, and one big politician of Canada whom I met in London at the coronation of the present King assured me that <inline font-style="italic">except</inline> in <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> States there was more bribery and corruption in Canada than in the United States of America. What has brought about the change? Nothing but the initiative, referendum, and recall, and it is a noteworthy fact that the strongest supporters of those three magic words are the members of the Country party in the United States of America. The principle of the referendum and recall is strongly supported by the farmers&#39; unions throughout America. It may be only because of its recent formation that the Country party in this House has not added the principle to its platform. Out of .forty-five questions submitted to the vote of the people in the State of Ohio, no less than seventeen pertained to the farmers&#39; interests. I propose to read to honorable members a quotation which indicates the rapidity with which the principle of initiative, referendum, and recall is becoming the law in the United States of America. If Switzerland can be justly called the school-house of Europe, the United States can certainly be said to be the school-house of the American continent. I wish our beloved Australia to become the school-house of the world, for it has greater potentialities than has the brave little land in the Alps. Honorable members will understand the truth of that when I tell them that the only natural product which Switzerland is able to export is asphalt. All other exports comprise goods which have been manufactured from imported material. The following particulars, taken from a book issued by the American Academy of Political and Social Science, show that in thirteen years, from 1898 to 1912, fourteen States in America have adopted the referendum and initiative, though some had to have it adopted twice by their Legislatures before it could be submitted to the people. </para>

            <para>That a Select Committee, consisting of seven members of this House, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the conditions of the Australian overseas and Inter-State sea carriage. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The shipping of Australia is controlled by the Commonwealth Shipping Board and the Inter-State Central Shipping Committee. The first of these bodies consists of : Engineer Rear-Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Clarkson, Controller of Shipping; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie; Colonel Oldershaw,</inline> representing the Commonwealth Government; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. Owen</inline> Cox, of Birt and Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wesche,</inline> of Macdonald, Hamilton and Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline> of Howard Smith Limited; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter,</inline> of McIlwraith, McEacharn and Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright,</inline> of Gibbs, Bright and Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brodie,</inline> of John Sanderson and Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eva,</inline> manager in Australia of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dowdell,</inline> branch manager of the Orient Line. All our oversea shipping is in the hands of this Board, whose arrangements have been most unsatisfactory to the people of some of the States at least. In Tasmania, the secretary of the local Board is the servant of one of our biggest exporters, and there the conditions, to state the fact mildly, have been the reverse of satisfactory to the shippers and the trading companies. The Inter-State Central Shipping Committee consists of : Engineer Rear-Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Clarkson; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunter,</inline> Deputy-Controller of Coastal Shipping; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Appleton,</inline> of Huddart, Parker Limited; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> of the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Newman,</inline> of Howard Smith Limited; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Northcote,</inline> of the Adelaide Steam-ship Company; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. York</inline> Syme, junior, of the Melbourne Steam-ship Company; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Turnbull,</inline> of the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company. It will be seen that the members of this committee, like the members of the Board which controls the oversea shipping, are all managers of shipping companies interested. When the composition of the committee was announced to Parliament, I was sitting behind the Government, but I at once rose in my place and urged that representatives of the public should be appointed to the committee. It was pointed out that that was not possible, and then I asked that four members of the House, two chosen from each side, should be appointed to the committee, to look after the interests of the public. That has not been done, and I say now, deliberately, that the committee&#39;s control of our shipping has been the reverse of satisfactory. </para>

              <para>- By way of illustrating the way in which our shipping affairs are being mismanaged, let me instance what occurred in connexion with the recent strike of marine engineers. That strike should never have been allowed to break out. The engineers, had been treated most unfairly, because there were tin the engine-rooms of our steamers men who had paid considerable sums for their engineering education, and had spent years in learning their business, and yet were receiving less than the pay of stokers, while their accommodation was disgraceful. Had half the terms that were offered afterwards been offered before the strike commenced, with the right of an appeal to the Court, there would have been no strike. I blame the engineers for not accepting the Government offer, because it was a fair one; but there would have been no&#60; strike had tilings been better managed. I came across Bass Strait on the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah</inline> on 18th December last. Her crew had then two months to run under their signed articles. They had signed on in Sydney, and so long as the vessel was running between Melbourne and Tasmania, the engineers and others on board her were compelled to keep to their duty. I am not betraying a confidence when I say that those engineers were willing to remain at work, and had the full and complete sanction of their union for doing so. Before the steamer arrived at Melbourne, there was some trouble with the cooks and stewards, and her crew .was paid off. Although the difference with the cooks and stewards was quite unimportant, as the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah</inline> was at that time the only steamer of any size trading between the mainland and Tasmania, this meant that Tasmania was thus absolutely cut off from communication, with the result that between 500 and 600 persons, among whom were many women and chil dren, were stranded in Melbourne under the most painful circumstances. After some time the Tasmanian Government allowed their tourist bureau here to pay the board and lodging of these persons pending a settlement of the trouble; but although I had intended to remain only two days in Melbourne, I had to stop here for two months,  because  I could not leave all these persons unassisted. In the end, they were taken across on small boats. The <inline font-style="italic">Grace Darling,</inline> which was working under the same conditions as the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah,</inline> continued to be run. </para>

              <para>- No; I am trying to put the blame where it should lie. There was no reason why the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah</inline> should have been paid, off, because from the captain downwards, those on board were prepared to keep running her, as the <inline font-style="italic">Grace Barling</inline> was being kept running, and, until she returned to Sydney, the engineers could not give notice. But a telegram was sent to Burnie by the Shipping Committee, asking the captain and officers to stand by the vessel, and saying that the rest of those employed on her would be discharged on her arrival in Melbourne. What is the position of affairs to-day? It is not now possible to run a boat between Tasmania and Queensland. For some years I have been trying to secure direct communication between these two States, for the reason that, the one being the most temperate, and the other the most tropical, State, there is a great basis of trade betweenthem. The difficulty, however, is that we are compelled to ship ;prod&#39;uce from Tasmania to Sydney. &#34;We have to discharge perishable produce upon the Sydney wharfs, and it must lie there until a boat is going to Queensland. Then the produce has to be transhipped into the Queensland vessel, and taken on to a port in the Northern State. If the people of Tasmania desire to import maize or sugar or any other product from Queensland, we cannot do so direct. The stuff must be brought down to Sydney and discharged on the wharfs. Then it must be transhipped to Tasmania. Why ? Because there is an honorable understanding between the shipping companies to the. effect that one firm shall not  trespass  upon the preserves of another. </para>

              <para>- I say deliberately that the Shipping Board does not give a fair deal to the people of Tasmania. The whole of the InterState trade has been placed under the full strength of the War Precautions Act and its regulations, and, at the same time, the Government have commandeered the Inter-State fleet and placed those vessels in the hands of the companies themselves. What is the position now ? Here are telegrams from my own State. Producers cannot get supplies of manures. Sowing has had to stop. I have had messages from two of the biggest firms in Tasmania, intimating that it is impossible for them to supply farmers with manures, and that, as a result, the industry is practically held up. </para>

I suggest that the Government reconstitute the Shipping Board&#39; if it is to continue in existence. I will recall to honorable members what happened with respect to quarantine. Hundreds of Tasmanian women were stranded in Melbourne, and the Shipping Controller would not allow one of them to depart for home. I was informed that the reason for this prohibition was that there was no quarantine accommodation available in Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- I am now dealing with the Shipping Board and with their hold-up. These women could not sail for Tasmania because the Shipping Board said there was no quarantine accommodation. I knew that that excuse was inaccurate, because I myself had inspected the Tasmanian quarantine accommodation. I sent a telegram to the Federal Health Officer in .Tasmania, who informed me that there was quarantine accommodation available. In order to make my case absolutely sure I despatched a &#34; wire&#34; to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Goddard,</inline> in charge of the quarantine station at Bruni,  and he replied that there was accommodation for thirty men and twenty-seven women. But the Shipping Board would not allow the women to travel. In the case of some of the  stranded families ruin stared them in the face. I know of one instance in particular where a man was compelled to take passage for Tasmania in order to save his affairs, but the only way in which he could do so was to ship as a steward, and for his wife to engage as a stewardess. This Board has crucified my State. </para>

          <para>I am not at all satisfied with the oversea shipping arrangements. Last year three firms in Tasmania secured the cold storage space available for the export of apples. The fruit-grower had had a bad time. The whole of his pear crop had rotted in the orchard; a good portion of his apple crop was rotting. When the orchardist was offered from fs. to 7s. 6d. per case for his fruit in Hobart, he found he was compelled to sell for 6s. per case to those people who had monopolized the shipping space. &#34;What would producers upon the mainland think and do if wheatgrowers were offered 6s. 6d. to. 7s. a bushel, but were compelled to sell to some party for 5s. or 5s. 6d. per bushel, because that party had secured a monopoly of the shipping space? </para>

              <para>- Well,  i  think  i  did something toward securing what we have got. The. fact is that we have not got nearly the extent of freight space that we had before. The average quantity of apples shipped from Hobart  to England  for the four years prior to the war was about 840,000 tons. The total shipping space likely to be made available to us this year, I am afraid, will not exceed 600,000 tons. The Government should agree to the appointment of a Select Committee. If I am not wanted upon its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> I will willingly stand down and leave the Government free to choose from whom they like. It has been truly said that those who control transport govern the community. Tasmania, being an island State, is absolutely at the mercy of the shipping companies. Before the war we were paying 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. per bushel for freight to England. During the war, while submarining was at its height, and when ships were being sunk every day, the then Minister for Trade and Customs fixed what was described as a fair price for the freight upon apples, namely, 3s. 6d. per bushel. The war ended, and last year the freight rate was raised to 7s. 6d. per bushel. This year it has been raised still further - to 8s. per bushel. </para>

              <para>- I cannot get any. The <inline font-style="italic">Wiltshire</inline> left Hobart a couple  of days ago with 140,000 cases of apples on board. The freight rate was 8s. per case.

              <para>- TheRotomahana was one that was taken off. For cargo boats of 4,500 tons, the Government paid a charter of 14s. a ton per month, or &#163;54,000 a year. I believe the rate has been considerably increased since; and there ought to be no loss on such figures. For smaller boats of 1,500 tons, the Government paid &#163;14,888 per annum, and, again, there should beno loss. </para>

          <para>There are other matters which are more of local concern. Under the Federal contract with the Union Steamship Company and Messrs. Huddart, Parker, a certain amount is paid for the carriage of the mails to Tasmania, a condition being that fares shall not be increased without the consent of the PostmasterGeneral. When the first strike to which I have referred was on, the companies did not increase their fares, but, on the ground that they could not guarantee return passages, they did not issue return tickets, and made passengers pay full single rates both ways. This plan the shipping companies have continued ever since. When I asked the PostmasterGeneral, in Parliament, whether his consent had been obtained to this alteration in the fares, he said that it had not, and that he knew nothing whatever about the matter; and it is certain that the companies have evaded the spirit, if not the letter, of the contract. Since then there has been another increase, and I am informed that still another is about to be made. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to import political considerations into this question; and I appeal to the House whether I have not tried to put the case fairly and moderately. I feel very sore about the present condition of affairs, because I have seen people in Tasmania crushed by rings and monopolies, in whose grip we are. It is not creditable to the country that it is now impossible to trade directly between Queensland and Tasmania. These States have more in common than any other two, and present many reasons for direct trade, in view of the fact that one is the most tropical, and the other the most temperate, in Australia. Goods sent from Tasmania to Queensland, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> have to be transhipped in Sydney, and are left exposed on the wharfs until some other boat comes along, and all because of this &#34;honorable understanding&#34; amongst the. shipping companies. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>There is not an export port in Tasmania that is not absolutely clogged with produce which is urgently required in other States. The honorable member for Darwin can bear me out when I say that the wharfs in his electorate are laden with potatoes, that deteriorate in the waiting so much as to be scarcely worth shipping; and similar conditions can be found at Burnie and Devonport. I am not asking too much from the Government when I move for a Select Committee to thoroughly investigate the overseas and Inter-State shipping conditions of Australia, because the result must be to the best interests of the whole of the community. </para>

            <para>.- I have much pleasure in seconding the motion. There may be actually nothing wrong with the control of shipping, but there are many suspicious circumstances which it is desirable should be cleared up for the sake of the public and the good name of the Government. As an instance, let me cite the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Five Islands,</inline> a steamer which was lying idle in Sydney at a time when we were supposed tobe suffering seriously owing to lack of shipping. The vessel had been idle, not for days, but for many weeks, and a small firm in Sydney obtained a charter to carry from Darwin to southern ports certain goods that are urgently needed here. The charter was one which would return those concerned only reasonable interest; and it was considerably to their astonishment, and to the astonishment of the owners of the goods which they had in view, when the Controller of Shipping ordered the charter to be cancelled, and informed the charterers that, instead of going to Darwin, they would be called upon to carry coal from New South Wales ports to Adelaide and other South Australian ports. I do not insinuate that there was anything wrong in what was done, but, at the least, the facts are such that some investigation is desirable. The charterers of the <inline font-style="italic">Five Islands</inline> were ordered by the Controller of Shipping to carry this coal at a price which showed an actual loss per trip; and, as an indication of the rottenness of the control, they were not allowed to bring one ounce of back cargo from South Australian ports to enable them to turn the charter into a payable one. I am indebted to the persons who chartered the <inline font-style="italic">Five Islands</inline> for the facts I have stated, and I am informed that the result was a loss of hundreds of pounds, while goods in Darwin were hung up there because no shipping was available. Honorable members from Sydney, who come in contact with shipping people, know of many instances of boats being laid up for weeks, and also know that the moment any attempt is made to charter -them for trade the Controller steps in and stops proceedings. It would be interesting to know what happened in connexion with the chartering of the <inline font-style="italic">Gabo</inline> when she was lying idle. A charter, obtained by certain people, was cancelled by order of the Controller, but it would appear that certain other people were able to charter her for a trade which took her away from the Australian const. Of course, everything in this transaction may have been right and legitimate, but there is room for inquiry and explanation. It is a remarkable thing that the Inter-State shipping companies are allowed to do the very business that the . small ship-owners desire to carry on, while the <inline font-style="italic">Five Islands</inline> is given the non-paying business of carrying coal to South Australian ports without return cargo. Whenever there was a chance of a trader securing a return on a charter of a boat, the charter was nearly always cancelled. </para>

            <para>.- I did not anticipate that this very important motion would be called on to-day-, and, in the circumstances, I am not prepared to say all I want to say on it. If the adjournment had been allowed to go through on the voices, so much prominence would not have been attached to the motion as has been given to it by the division just taken.

          <para>The motion is wide enough to embrace the whole question of shipping control. I have already said during this session that the Government, would be well advised to get rid of their control of shipping; but I do not think that some of the public who are now complaining would be too well pleased if it were done, because immediately the Government control is lifted, freights and fares on the Australian coast will rise considerably. As a matter of fact, the Government are losing money hand over fist on shipping. On one occasion last year I had to spend seventeen days in quarantine owing to influenza breaking out on a vessel on which I was travelling, and although it must have cost at least 10s. per head per day to keep the passengers and ship&#39;s crew, the Government&#39;s charge for our upkeep was not more than &#163;1 lis. 6d. per head for the whole period, </para>

              <para>- The traders in many parts of Australia desire the Government control of shipping to cease. But for action taken by the Controller of Shipping, a number of vessels of less than 1,000 tons register would have been able to run on the Australian coast during the Marine Engineers&#39; strike. It is true, as the honorable member for Franklin said, that great dissatisfaction with shipping conditions has existed for a long time in Tasmania. Owing to the influenza .epidemic, the occurrence of strikes, and other causes, we have had a great shortage in transport facilities, and our producers have suffered heavy losses. They are naturally indulging in hard words against the control. Shortly before I left Tasmania, a large number of producers representing the north-west coast met in conference, and decided to send a deputation to Melbourne to interview the Prime Minister and the Controller of Shipping. That deputation has n&#39;ot yet arrived. I am very anxious that producers and others who have reason to complain should learn first-hand what the Government have to say in support of the position taken up by them. In that way, many misapprehensions would be removed. My desire  i6  that this motion shall be carried. </para>

              <para>- It is useless to vote on the motion until we hear what the Government have to say on the subject. My own view is that a comprehensive inquiry would clear up what appear to be a number of suspicious circumstances, that have made an impression on the minds of many people. I do not believe there is any foundation for many of the complaints that are being made. I have been in touch with the Controller of Shipping for some time, because, in my electorate, there are important ports from which large quantities of produce are shipped to the mainland. I am satisfied that, having regard to the shipping available, the Controller has done his best to meet our requirements*. </para>

              <para>- It is only right thatthe public should know the history of the Shipping Control. The Government are losing a great deal of money in connexion with it. At the outset, they derived considerable revenue from it in connexion with the overseas trade, but all the money so obtained has been spent, in addition to hundreds of thousands of pounds in continuing the control, and the Controller will have to ask Parliament for a substantial sum to enable him to carry on. If the control is removed there will undoubtedly be an immediate increase in fares and freights, otherwise shipping will leave our coast. The shipping companies are not likely to carry on under existing conditions. On the other hand, the Government themselves cannot continue the control without increasing fares and freights if they are to have due regard to the welfare of the general body of taxpayers. Thus from every point of view it is in the interests of the Government that there should be a thorough investigation, and that they should divest themselves as soon as possible of the control of shipping. No matter what they do, there are many people who will find fault with them, and they would certainly get into calmer waters by allowing the shipping trade to revert back to the old system. Merchants and others are asking for the control to be lifted, and they must not complain if, as a result of the granting of their request, their position instead of being improved becomes worse. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Franklin has often in this House drawn attention to the position of the primary producers in his electorate. In my own electorate as the result of the shipping strike the people have lost thousands of pounds. While the strike was in progress the price of potatoes in Sydney was very high. Producers in my electorate who, on the whole, had secured a good crop, would have been able to obtain excellent prices  on the Sydney market had shipping been available. As it is, hundreds of tons of potatoes will, never be dug. The eel worm, the grub, and various parasitic growths have got into them, and they are now not worth digging. The Controller has done his best .to meet our shipping requirements, but he has had a very hard row to hoe, and I think he will be well pleased if the control is speedily lifted. </para>
          <para>I had intended to put before the House some figures relating to this question, but since the motion was called on unexpectedly I have not been able to obtain my notes, and have had to be content to roughly outline to the Government tho position in Tasmania to-day. </para>

            <para>.- I voted for the continuation of this- debate, because, as a Queensland representative, I have certain complaints to make against &#39;the manner in which the shipping has been administered. I say nothing against Admiral Clarkson; I believe he is the most capable man that we could possibly get for the position. I know that it is necessary to increase the rates of freight in order to make the shipping business pay; the people of Queensland offer no objection to that, but they do object to the present differential treatment. If we have shipments from Adelaide, and we cannot get through freight to the port of discharge, the goods are transhipped at Melbourne and Sydney, and finally at Brisbane, if they are destined for Rockhampton, Maryborough, Townsville, or other ports, and the consignees are charged short-distance freights, plus transhipment charges, which increase the cost to the consumer by as much as 33 per cent. Some alteration has been promised to the extent that, if through freight, is booked to Maryborough or Rockhampton, by a through steamer through freight rates will . be charged. Admiral Clarkson has promised to try to arrange for vessels to run right through to the port of discharge, but there is no guarantee that he will be able to do that. In the meantime, the people of Queensland are taxed by the short-distance rates and the extra cost of transhipment. If  the Government would only make some arrangement which would enable the Queensland merchant to know what his goods will cost before they arrive, he would be prepared to pay a higher rate, but he desires to know in advance what the rate will be, so that he can calculate his costs and quote the storekeepers for the goods with which he will supply them on arrival. So far, I have not been able to get a promise that that will be done. The Chambers of Commerce have written asking me &#39;to urge that this relief be granted. I desire from the Minister controlling shipping an assurance &#39;that Queensland merchants will be able to get through rates of freight from any port of shipment to the port of discharge. In connexion with shipments from overseas, we used to get bills of lading to the port of final discharge, and by that means were able to at once calculate our costs; but to-day our goods from London are discharged in Melbourne or Sydney, and we have to appoint agents to take charge of them, make fresh entries, and see that the consignments are removed to another wharf for transhipment to Queensland. All that expense could be saved by reversion to the old conditions that obtained when the shipping business was carried on by private enterprise without any interference from the Government. Wow it is hard to calculate what additional charges we shall have to pay on our overseas goods on account of the employment of agents at each port of transhipment, additional insurance, and fresh Customs entries, cartage, and so forth. Why should not the officers who are connected with the Inter-State shipping be employed to carry on the work under the old conditions, and thus obviate some of the extra cost to the Queensland merchants ? Why cannot we now revert to the conditions that obtained before the war? Large shipments are now coming from overseas, and we desire to know what treatment is to be meted out to consignees in Queensland in respect to goods landed in Sydney and Melbourne. In the past the Inter-State shipping companies  took charge of transhipped goods, and forwarded them at the earliest opportunity to the port of final discharge, without making any extra charge. I quite understand that while the strike continued it was impossible for Admiral Clarkson to accept the full responsibility for goods, which had to remain on the wharfs for an indefinite period, and were liable to pillage. Under the old conditions the companies which accepted goods for carriage were responsible for losses by pillage; but what chance has a merchant in Queensland now of recovering losses in this way, when it is impossible for him to ascertain whether the pillaging took place on the voyage to Australia or between Australian ports? Losses by pillage are serious to the merchant. The shipping companies stated some time ago that the claims they had to pay in Sydney alone for pillage amounted to &#163;100,000 per annum. If the merchants are obliged to bear that loss which formerly was borne by the shipping companies the cost of living must be increased considerably. This matter is of such vital importance to the people that an opportunity of discussing it in the House should not be withheld. I ask the Min ister to look into the matter in conjunction with the Controller of Shipping, and endeavour to arrange that even-handed justice is meted out to the people of Queensland in common with the people in the larger capitals. The people in Victoria and New South Wales are hot subject to the disabilities I have mentioned, and do not seem to care to help their less fortunate fellows, but the present conditions are serious for Queensland merchants who are buying goods from overseas or from South Australia or Tasmania, and who cannot say what the goods will cost until they have been finally landed and examined. The people of Western Australia must be experiencing the same disability, and I should like the honorable members who represent that State to join with me in impressing upon the Minister the necessity for investigating the matter. I have tried by letters and by interviews to secure attention to the grievances of the people of Queensland, and I now take this opportunity of appealing for the consideration which has hitherto been withheld. The people of Queensland have suffered enough through the strikes without having this further disability of short-distance freights and additional handling charges continued. </para>

          <para>The amendment has the approval  of  my party.  I  wish to direct special attention to the final clause  of  it, which,  if  adopted, would make the war gratuity a cash payment, for  if  bonds are negotiable at the banks - and that, as  I  shall show, the Prime Minister promised they would be - the payment would become  a  cash transaction. </para>
          <para>The  right honorable gentleman,  in  moving  the  second reading  of the Bill,  placed  the  onus  of any  disapproval  that  might be attached to inalienable bonds upon the Returned Soldiers League, and insisted over and over again that the conditions provided in the Bill were those asked for by the representatives of the soldiers themselves. He said the Returned Soldiers and Sailors&#39; Imperial League adopted the views (1) that a cash payment would be impossible; (2) that a cash payment may be made in certain limited cases; (3) that a Board or authority would be appointed to which the Soldiers League would nominate one member; and (4) that the scheme of bonds not negotiable was approved by the soldiers themselves. That is the onus of responsibility placed on the Soldiers League. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister further claimed (1) that the people had rejected a cashpayment to the soldiers; and (2) that he was keeping his pledges &#39;both in the letter and in the spirit. </para>
          <para>Into his speech the Prime Minister wove a very nice little fairy tale based upon selected portions of his election utterances; but, as I shall show, he omitted later important statements. </para>
          <para>If the soldiers and those associated with them voted for the Government at the election, they voted for them on these later specific pledges. That statement I shall support with evidence regarding each part of the amendment. </para>
          <para>The Brisbane Policy. The Prime Minister went to Brisbane on the 21st October, 1919. He there first announced the gratuity policy, and returned to Melbourne. On the 30th October a meeting was held in the Sydney Town Hall. It was convened by Captain Carmichael, the head of an organization called the Soldiers and Citizens&#34; Association, for the express purpose of obtaining the soldiers&#39; indorsement of the Brisbane announcement. </para>
          <para>Captain Carmichael had just previously been upon a visit to the Prime Minister, and the Sydney Town Hall was engaged by the Liberal Association in Sydney through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Archdall  Parkhill. But the upshot of this endeavour to obtain support for the Prime Minister was a unanimous chorus of indignation  from  the meeting, which rejected with scorn the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister at Brisbane. </para>
          <para>As a consequence of this, the Prime Minister issued an amended policy on the 2nd November. It was from this amended statement, which, as he said in his speech, appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> on the 4th November, that he wove the little fairy tale in his speech. </para>
          <para>But there were other developments. The soldiers were still dissatisfied. The right honorable gentleman came back to Sydney on the 6th November. He was, by arrangement, to address a mass meeting of the soldiers there in Martin-place, and he had the Town Hall engaged for a meeting to which only certain exclusive persons were given admission by ticket, the soldiers themselves being prevented from attending. But he had not the courage to face the meeting of soldiers in Martin-place, who, having carried resolutions denouncing him, marched in a body, thousands strong, and demanded admittance into the Town Hall. After his  speech  there, however, the Prime Minister left by a door on the southern side of the building, and ran like a hunted hare to his motor car in Bathurst-street Thereupon the mob of returned soldiers marched to the Grosvenor Hotel, and battered down the door. </para>

            <para>Gratuity for Soldiers - Eighteenpence a Day to be Paid in 5&#188; per cent. Bonds. </para>
            <para>Brisbane. - In the course of his speech on Tuesday night, at the Exhibition Hall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> announced that, as the result of a conference between the executive of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors&#39; Imperial League and himself, the Government proposed to pay a gratuity to soldiers on the basis of1s. 6d. a day, in interest-bearing bonds, non-negotiable, carrying 5&#188; per cent, interest. These bonds would not be transferable except with the Treasury Department&#39;s consent. Special arrangements would be made for redemption in cases of hardship or urgency, or for widows on re-marriage. The indemnity to be paid on or before May, 1921, would be used for the purpose of redeeming from 20 to 40 per cent, of these bonds. The bonds wouldbe taken by the Commonwealth, and presumably by the States, in payment for houses, land, and other matters coming under the heading of repatriation. Arrangements as to when payments should commence, and other details, would be announced later. </para>
            <para>The gratuity, proceeded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> involved the Commonwealth in a liability of somewhere between&#163; 23,000,000 and &#163;25,000,000 of money. It was impossible to raise that money at the present time. If the Government did raise it and withdraw it from enterprise and production, it would be doing infinitely more harm than good to the soldiers. The Government had just attempted to raise &#163;25,000,000, but had not succeeded. It was only because it had fallen back on the banks that it had been able to get the money. </para>

            <para>That this House directs the Government to pass legislation before it rises to honour the promise of the Prime Minister at Brisbane on 21st October, in regard to soldier pensions, and the payment of war gratuities to soldiers and the widows of deceased soldiers. </para>

          <para>In support of that motion I pointed out that this dodge of making a promise to the soldiers on the eve of a general election was a repetition of what was done under similar circumstances in 1917, when the Government had promised concessions to returned men amounting to &#163;29,000,000, and I showed that, on 8th October, as the House was dissolving to go to election, &#163;25,000,000 worth of those pledges was still unredeemed. </para>
          <para>Sydney Soldiers&#39; Meeting. Now I come tothe meeting in the Town Hall, at which Captain Carmichael was the chief speaker. The hall had been taken by the Liberal Association, to boost the policy of the Government, but the funds for the so-called Soldiers and Citizens&#39; League, which had been created, were provided by the graziers of&#39; Australia. That was admitted subsequently by Captain Carmichael, when the graziers refused to pay over any more money. At this mass meeting, resolutions were passed demanding that the war gratuity should be paid in cash. That is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 31st October last. Following this demonstration, the Prime Minister issued from Melbourne an amended statement of his policy. </para>

They are easily the most lucrative investment in the country, paying more interest than the lust war loan, and the banks, 1 think, would take them. I hope to be able yet, when I have consulted my colleague the Treasurer, to come to an arrangement with the bigfirms of Australia, and private banks generally, to receive these bonds, and hold them so that those of the soldiers who want cash may get it, the banks to hold them, and we to redeem them from the banks. I make no promises, mind you, but it is my desire to place no obstacles in the way of reputable banks and employers, not money lenders, who are prepared to take these bonds and advance the cash value of them and hold them. If we can arrange that, all the difficulties will have been smoothed away, and we will be able to pay the soldiers that which they consider a vital matter, and at the same time not injure the country. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, made reference to the fact that a large number of private employers had promised to pay cash to their soldier employees in exchange for gratuity bonds, and I propose to read the list of firms, so far as Sydney is concerned. I have no doubtthat there are other firms similarly situated in every capital - those great firms which are assisting the Prime Minister to get the soldiers&#39; vote. Although the Prime Minister has said that these promises were made in his speeches, there is no provision in the Bill under which these firms can be called on, or even allowed, to cash the bonds. Indeed, section 15 specifically prohibits it. The bonds are inalienable, and the firms are prohibited from cashing them. The following is a list of the firms which undertook to cash&#39; the gratuity bonds, according to the Sydney newspapers: - </para>

There is no provision in the Bill tomake them stand up to their obligations, and I am ready to say that not many of them will carry out their promises unless the strong arm of the law compels them to do so.

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>received a somewhat turbulent  but typically cordial reception from a bi: crowd of Diggers in Sydney on Thursday. Tho matter of the war gratuity was again  touched  on and explained. As it stands, any man needing immediate- cash for any good purpose will be enabled to negotiate his bonds, which is really all that any reasonable man can expect to receive. In a statement on Friday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> announced the proposals of the banks for negotiating the bonds, and the scheme, coupled with the concessions already made, provides for the immediate realization of a very considerable proportion of the bonds. Practically the whole of the remainder will be redeemable within two years. </para>
      <para>To-day the Prime Minister told us that when he was in London the Home authorities were discussing the 1920 war campaign against Germany. If that was the case, the Government knew perfectly well that they would have to raise large sums of money to carry on the war in 1920, so that the statement that this paltry &#163;25,000,000 or &#163;30,000,000 cannot be secured in cash is all nonsense and bunkum. We have raised &#163;200,000,000 in Australia for the purpose of carrying on the war, and if it had continued another &#163;100,000,000 would have been raised this year for the same purpose; yet we are told that there is not &#163;25,000,000 procurable in Australia for the purpose of paying the soldiers a gratuity. </para>

When we were endeavouring to raise the last war loan the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> printed an article setting forth the attitude of the mayors of several- Sydney suburban municipalities. The Mayor of Drummoyne complained about the very small quota allotted to the wealthy suburb of Hunter&#39;s Hill; but said that, although it was unfair to place Drummoyne on the same footing as Hunter&#39;s Hill, which was ever so much more wealthy, Drummoyne would guarantee to raise the amount of the quota allotted to it, and would challenge Hunters Hill to get its amount before Drummoyne did. The Mayor of Hunter&#39;s Hill, Alderman Windeyer, said that the quota allotted to his municipality was merely a flea-bite, and that it could raise many times the amount. Then the Mayor of Manly came along and said, &#34; What are you grumbling about? Manly, which is merely &#39;one suburb of &#39; Sydney, will raise the &#163;9,500,000, the whole quota allotted to the State of New South Wales.&#34; </para>

        <para>Let me emphasize&#39; to&#39; the returned soldiers and the- public of Australia that this . proposal of the Government is merely to  issue a scrap of paper called a bond, which will return, to them &#163;5 5s. annually in the shape of interest on.- &#163;100 - face value of bonds, and very few war gratuities will reach &#163;100. The date of redemption is to be 1924 just a little after the next election. We had an election in 1917, at which the soldiers were promised &#163;29,000,000, of which &#163;25,000,000 had&#39; not been redeemed on the expiration of the Parliament then elected. </para>
        <para>Last year (1919) &#163;25,000,000 to . &#163;30,000,000 was promised to the soldiers on the eve of an election as part of the  Government&#39;s policy. The soldiers were led to believe they were to get it in cash, but it is not to be paid in cash, and we now find that the payment is to be putoff until 1924, just after the next election. So the Government hope for the third time to fool these soldiers and those  associated with them.In 1923 theywill say, &#34; Now, gentlemen, come along and vote for us, and we shall provide you with the cash for these bonds as soon as the election is over.&#34; And thus they will seek to get another three years of office.

The debentures are to bear 5&#188; per cent, interest, and from 20 to 40 per cent, of them will be payable in 1921, out of German money. Where Germany is to get the cash is not yet clear. Depreciated marks would not be much use, and we are not likely to take it out in trade. The question, therefore, is: Does the Government see its way to honour the bonds in eighteen months&#39; time in the event of Germany&#39;s default? Besides, what use is a five and a quarter per cent, security for &#163;50 or &#163;100 to a man in want of ready money?. It is what it will sell for in the market.

      <para>From the Prime Minister&#39;s, own statements, I have given evidence, point by point, in support of every line of this indictment. It really crystallizes the election policy of this Government - a policy which the Government now repudiate in the Bill before us. The Labour party promised not only that, if returned to office, they would pay the war gratuity in cash, but that they would do everything within their power to see that a cash payment was made if the present Government won the elections. I promised the soldiers in my electorate - and there are a very considerable number of them - that when the flag-flapping and the band-banging of the Nationalists had ceased, they would find, myself and other members of the Labour party demanding in this Parliament that the politicians who had wrapped the Union Jack about them, and prated about their loyalty, should carry out their pledges. That is where we find ourselves at the very opening of the Parliament. </para>
      <para>The Government have not carried out their election pledge. I believe that the returned soldiers&#39; votes turned the scale at the election ; that the Prime Minister, by constantly impressing upon returned soldiers, and especially their women folk, the promise that they were to get cash, induced them to vote for his party, and thus turned the tide in his favour. I saw soldiers going from meeting to meeting dissatisfied with the Prime Minister&#39;s promise. I found afterwards that many had decided to vote for his party, and had arrived at that conclusion because of these promises, starred in the newspapers, that the bonds would be such that any recipient could hand them over a bank counter, and obtain cash for them. </para>
      <para>These promises are not carried out in the Bill. I have taken this opportunity to crystallize the Prime Minister&#39;s pledges in an amendment which will be placed on the records of Parliament, and which may be read, not only by the returned soldiers, but by the general public of Australia. When the next electioncomes along - when the Government are again appealing to the soldiers on the ground that they will redeem these bonds when the new Parliament meets in 1924, they will be faced with this damning evidence, which will be on the records, and which should destroy the chances of this so-called patriotic Government, not only with the returned soldiers, but with the people of Australia as a whole. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> has made a characteristic speech, and has shown in his closing sentence exactly the object that it is designed to serve. He has told us that he has made his speech with an eye to the next election. Once again, we see him attempting, as other members of the Labour party have done, to use the returned soldiers for party purposes. The returned soldiers&#39; answer to such attempts is to be found in the person of the occupants of the back Ministerial benches. Every man in this House who wears a returned soldier&#39;s badge is satisfied with the provisions of this Bill. We are satisfied that the Government are carrying out their pledges in introducing it as the first measure to be considered by the Parliament. The honorable member for Cook has made quotations from many newspapers, and has thrown over them all that baleful light which he knows so well how to accumulate. I desire to read to the House the, actual classes of persons who, according to the Prime Minister&#39;s own statement, were to have their bonds cashed. I propose to quote from the statement issued to candidates who were supporting the Prime Minister, and on which I, as well as other candidates belonging to the Ministerial party, fought our election, so far as the war gratuity was concerned. </para>

The returned men in this House are satisfied with the Bill because it is generous in its provisions. The Government brought it in at the very earliest opportunity. It is as wide in its scope as any reasonable man could expect, and it protects those who, unfortunately, need protection.

        <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> in discussing this measure yesterday, referred to the great increase in bank deposits as affording certain proof that Australia was in a position to pay the war gratuity in cash. It is hard to believe that the honorable member could seriously put&#39; forward the argument that the increase in bank deposits is a sound reason for paying the gratuity in cash. As a matter of fact it is the very opposite. The increase in bank deposits is but a sign of the swollen finances of the community. These deposits in the banks do not consist only of cash. In most cases they are securities against which advances have been made. The tremendously swollen amount of deposits in our banks to-day is our greatest financial danger, yet the Leader of the Opposition tells us that it is proof that the country is in a position to pay the gratuity in cash. I should like the House to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenna,</inline> who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and is now  chairman  of the London Joint City and Midland Bank, had to say on the subject of*. bank deposits. In the <inline font-style="italic">Statist</inline> of 21st January last he is reported to have said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We have seen that any other cause of an increase in deposits, except bank loans, is not large, and we have concluded that bank loans have been responsible for an increase of &#163;1,100,000,000 in bank deposits. </para>
          <para>The loans to the States have led to an immense increase of deposits. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is the danger existing here at the present time. &#39;Our currency is so inflated by the exigencies of war that the banks are overloaded in many cases with war bonds and other securities against which they have made advances. These deposits, which the honorable member quotes as proof of our soundness, afford the most complete proof we could have of the danger that would- accrue to Australia attempting to pay the war gratuity in cash. Our soldiers, having had their vision widened by their experience overseas, having seen a good deal more than they would have seen had they stayed at home, realize the dangers of the situation. The returned man knows  that the cost of living to-day in Australia, high, as it is, is nothing like as high as in other countries,and he does not wish to do anything that would cause it to rise to the extent that it has elsewhere. He knows that if we expand our finances to a greater extent than is necessary we shall increase the cost of living, and in nine cases out of ten he is therefore anxious that this gratuity shall be paid in the way of bonds. Ample provision is made in the Bill to cash the bonds where real necessity exists, and the genuine returned soldier asks, for nothing more. But he. does resent men like the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> trying to drag him into party politics with a view to making use of him at the next election. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member who has just resumed his seathas introduced into the debate a very undesirable feature, because it ill-becomes any honorable member to indulge in personal recrimination regarding the services which men on this side of the House may or may not have rendered in certain circumstances. We occupy our seats in this House in accordance with the will of the majority of the electors in the constituencies we represent, and upon all questions each honorable member has a perfect right to express himself.Of course, there are some persons whose vision in regard to service is so narrow and limited that they give no credit to anybody else for having Honorable intentions and a desire to do that which is right. Every member of this community, especially the working classes, has had to make sacrifices&#39; by reason of the many disabilities imposed by the war - disabilities which the aftermath of war has even accentuated, so that many people find it difficult to contend with them. Although the Government endeavour to take a great deal of credit to themselves for the introduction of this measure, it represents no new departure. A similar course has been followed by victorious nations in the past. By the terms of this Bill, a large section of &#34;the Diggers&#34; will not receive cash, and they do not know when they will receive anything more than the interest on the gratuity which is promised.

          <para>It is also bad to place on posterity the obligation to pay a debt which we in this generation acknowledge. . . . There is only one safe and sensible way to liquidate a debt, and that . is to pay it- pay it out of our present assets if we can, and, if we cannot, tooverdraw on our future revenue. But for a nation to pay in promissory notes a debt of honour is, to say the least, unsound. . . . Winning the war meant literally defending, the business, and the property, and the capital in Australia. . . . Whatever method of payment we adopt, we must see that the man who fought is not compelled to pay also. But the&#34; digger &#34; will, as a taxpayer, have to pay his share of the5&#188; per cent. on his own paper bonus, just as hehas to pay his share of theinterest on all other war loans. But, if wepay in hard cash, we can get it by a direct wealth tax and a tax on war fortunes. This is the only just and feasible way. It is logical, too, for, if the result of the war had been other than victory, it is they, and they alone, who would have suffered financially. And is the wealth of Australia sufficient to stand a &#163; 25,000,000 levy ? The figures speak for themselves. Here they are: - </para>

        <para class="block">According to a reply I received from the Treasurer, up to the 31st December, 1919, a total of &#163;29,826,267 had been paid in interest on war loans. If money can be found to pay interest on war loans to financial institutions and those who are favorably circumstanced in life, the men who rendered war service abroad are at least deserving of equal consideration. It is a strong indictment against the Government that they are not prepared to give to the returned soldier in  recognition of his &#39; services during the crisis through which the Empire has just passed the same consideration as they are giving to the financial magnates. Under the proposed system of paying the gratuity in non-negotiable bonds, men who have given three or four years&#39; war service will draw in interest, which is the only monetary consideration about which they can have any degree of certainty, &#163;3 or &#163;4 per annum, or ls. 7d. per week, or  2&#189;d.  per day. We on this side of the House assert that if men are to be given recognition for the services! they rendered, they are justified in expecting the cash payment. The only cash they can be sure of receiving is the interest upon the bonds which are to be given to them. They should, however, receive full recognition, by the payment of a cash gratuity, of the services which they rendered. </para>
        <para>The Bill contains no provision for the payment of a gratuity to many who have just claims for consideration, and makes discriminations that are not just or equitable. A body of men who rendered very valuable services were those who went abroad to assist in the manufacture of munitions, and to do engineering work on the other side of the world. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> when addressing the House yesterday, told us that workmen in industries were as necessary to a nation as warriors in the field, and that equipment was as essential as men. While the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor)</inline> was speaking, the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom)</inline> interjected that munition workers were not subject to risks. That statement is not correct. When travelling at sea, they ran the same risks as the troops j and the secretary of the munition workers at Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tate)</inline> has declared that there were forty-five air raids over the place at which he was located in England during his employment there, and, no doubt, his experience was only in keeping with that of a majority of the munition workers. A member on the other side of the House has suggested that the munition workers earned good wages while ;away; but the Leader of the Opposition lias shown that their wages averaged only about &#163;2 a week. </para>

            <para>- The average wage paid to munition workers in England was &#163;4 10s. per week of seventy to ninety hours, and those who went from here received, in addition, only an allowance of &#163;5 for the voyage to Great Britain. They had two homes to keep going, having to make provision for those dependent on them whom they left behind, and to keep themselves in Great Britain. Therefore, their average pay- would be equivalent to about the sum stated by the Leader of the Opposition. The majority of those engaged in munition making did not earn princely salaries. -Furthermore, I understand that many of them were called upon to help in the repairing of submarines, and to make trial trips in these vessels, when they took the risk of. being submerged, and the ordinary dangers of warfare in the submarine service. The services of a number of these have been recognised, but those for whom I am making a claim are not dealt with in the Bill. Some of them were engaged as members of repair gangs behind the lines, and helped to supply the equipment which was essential to the men who were engaged in the fighting. It would be useless to place in the field an army without equipment. These men have a just claim to consideration, and I hope that in Committee favorable consideration . will be given to it. . For the sacrifices they have made, and the risks in which they have been involved, they are justly entitled to participate in the gratuity.- </para>

            <para>- Quite . so. Furthermore, these men signed an undertaking to join the fighting forces if called upon to do so. There are others who ought to be included in the Bill, but their claims will be advanced by other members of the Labour party. I hope that it will be generally recognised that it will be better for us to err on the side of generosity in dealing with this measure than to refuse to recognise rightful claims, and thus cause persons who have done service for thecountry to feel that they have nob been properly treated. My contribution to the debate has been made with the desire to see justice done to my fellow-citizens. If the Government is prepared to do the right thine, they will recognise the claims of all who directly rendered service in the war to this country and to the Empire. But if the provisions of the measure are so circumscribed as to deprive many who ought to enjoy recognition of any participation in the gratuity, a wrong will be. done, and the promises made to the electors will not be kept. It was stated definitely that the gratuity would be paid in cash. The attitude of the Prime Minister towards the gratuity was as changeable as the weather. When he arrived in Adelaide, things seemed rather desperate. This is how he is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Herald of</inline> the 11th November last - a Labour newspaper which tells the truth, and is, therefore, I believe, an exception to the general rule of newspapers in the Commonwealth - </para>

        <para class="block">Honorable members on this side are merely desirous that the Prime Minister shall act according to his promises made at the meeting of returned soldiers in the Adelaide Town Hall on the 10th November last. The Government. cannot justify their position in proposing now to issue non-negotiable bonds. The private wealth of this country was enhanced between 1914 and 1918 to the extent of &#163;272,000,000. Having regard to those huge figures, the amount involved in the payment of the soldiers&#39; gratuity is very small. It should be remembered that, while our men were fighting for the safety of Australia, and of her financial institutions&#39;, these latter were receiving enormous advantages as the outcome of the war. It is these institutions, these people made wealthy by the war, who should now be called upon to pay some amountof tribute to those who safeguarded and saved them. The workers of Australia who have suffered under the disabilities due to the war have not hesitated to say that it is only fitting that Australia&#39;s soldiers should be paid in cash ; and the levy should be drawn from those who have been bleeding our people. The wives and dependants of our soldiers have been the victims of profiteers. </para>

          <para>. - I do not propose to enter into any acrimonious discussion of this measure. I am quite conscious of the fact that many promises from many quarters were made during the period of the election. I am very thankful that I made no promises in the direction of cash payment. In every centre at which I spoke I took the course of leaving the matter of the gratuity until I was directly asked about it, and then I explained that the only business pro position was that which had been suggested in the first promises made by the Government to the soldiers. I am extremely proud of our soldiers, taking them in the aggregate. I am proud&#39; that they themselves have recognised that the proposed gratuity is a fair thing. I am not saying that I entirely favour the measure. I intimated, when speaking during the Address-in-Reply debate, that in my view it would have been better if the &#163;25,000,000 or &#163;30,000,000 to which the country is pledging itself on the soldiers&#39; behalf had been given them in a different form from that which is proposed. The Bill is not without its defects, and I hope that we shall&#34; be able to bring forward for the consideration of the Government modifications which appear to be necessary. It has been suggested that the money should be repaid in the same way as the debts which have accumulated owing to the war; that is to say, during our lifetime.  Some people have pleaded that posterity should not be burdened with our obligations. No truly National. Government would propose to render any great national service at a huge cost, and ask the people of the day to meet the whole of that cost, the benefits from which will accrue over many lifetimes. Australia will continue far beyond the lifetime of its present inhabitants. Australia is an asset that will balance a huge debt to posterity as well as to the people of to-day. The present generations are prepared to meet their reasonable share of the general obligation, but if the scheme which has been propounded by certain honorable members were carried into effect, it would strangle Australia even more surely than it is being strangled to-day, and further increase the cost of living. I have intimated my intention to move a new clause in the Committee stage, and I have been pleased to note that a returned soldier member of this Chamber has also given notice to similar effect. I daresay we shall be able to come to a reasonable compromise with regard to our proposals. My idea is not only to make the gratuity available to our returned men, but to enable them to so invest it that it will be, indeed, a gratuity in perpetuity. I hope the Government will make provision in this measure to enable them to provide satisfactorily for certain cases that are bound to crop up, but which cannot be included as a whole without bringing in a great number of those whom the &#34;dinkum&#34; soldiers do not desire to see benefiting under the gratuity scheme. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have received only this week a letter from a man who fought in &#39; the South African war and the Zulu war, and enlisted in 1914 fdr the recent war in Europe. He fought on Gallipoli, received, the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and was mentioned in despatches by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton. He is a captain, was invalided to England, and &#39; was punished by court martial for being absent without leave, and being found in an hotel drinking, or said to be drinking, with a couple of privates. I am speaking, of course, of this man&#39;s own version, for, as we know, there are always two sides to a story. I am hopeful that the Minister for Defence will have full inquiry made into this case, because a man with a record like this, who, after serving his sentence, went into Flanders and was wounded at Passchendaele, should, I think, be regarded most leniently, even if he has departed from the path of rectitude - a departure which may, perhaps, be excused after the hell fire of the war. I feel sure the Government will give this case reasonable consideration, and I hope the Bill will prove sufficiently elastic to justify the payment of the full gratuity to a man with such service to his credit. I cannot speak so feelingly of the Garrison Artillery, though I think that some consideration should be given to those men who freely volunteered for service abroad, but were not permitted to go. In Western Australia, at the Albany garrison, a number of the men were feverishly desirous to go to the Front, but they were distinctly told that they served their country quite as well in Australia, and that, moreover, it was not known when the enemy might reach our shores. My sympathies are with these men, but as they did not serve in the danger zone I cannot speak for them as I do for the man to whom I have particularly referred. Further opportunity will be afforded honorable members to deal with the Bill in Committee, and I shall not now prolong my remarks. I might say that during the election campaign I ceased, at a very early stage, to refer to the War Gratuity Bill in any way.

          <para>.- I had no great desire to take part in this debate, and proposed to reserve myself for the Committee stage. The Bill, however, has been most indecently used by the head of the Government. The members of the Opposition in the last Parliament were very anxious that this Bill should be dealt with before the appeal to the people, so that the intentions of the Government, , or the Parliament, might be fully known. In this the New Zealand Government provided a precedent, for their gratuity measure was passed into law before the general election; and, moreover in New Zealand there is a cash gratuity, and the people have been asked to assist in providing the necessary money by means of taxation. I am totally opposed to this gratuity being provided out of loan moneys, unless some provision is made for the repayment of the loan. During the war, of course, it was absolutely necessary that the Government should have to turn to loan moneys to meet our expenditure, but now we should have regard to the financial stability of Australia, and stop further borrowing for war purposes. The community generally should be appealed to for loans, or loans enforced, if the Government pleases, in order to provide the necessary funds. I am not trying to impress on the House any special fad of my own, but remind honorable members that the statesmen of Great Britain, from, the inception of the war, met more than 40 per cent, of the expenditure out of  revenue. The financial experts in the British Parliament are now forcing the Government by every means in their power to refrain from raising any more loans to meet war expenditure. Every country that has incurred expense through the war will have to introduce some sane method of wiping out its war debt. No interest is earned by the money spent on war, and we cannot continue in this country to raise further loans when the interest on our existing loans to-day is from 5$ to 6 per cent. We cannot make any progress if  we Lave to continue indefinitely to carry the burden of interest, and make no attempt to liquidate our war debt. No member of the House who is engaged in commercial pursuits would conduct his business on those lines, and why should not we, as the custodians of the revenue of Australia, endeavour to  apply  commercial principles to our conduct of the finances? We are not so impoverished as to have no alternative. No nation on earth has such grand  opportunities  as Australia has, if they are properly utilized, to meet the claim that has to be met. and yet no attempt is made by the Government to use them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We all know that the Prime Minister makes no claim to financial ability. The conduct of his own affairs is sufficient proof that he is in no way an expert in finance. As the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. H. Catts)</inline> pointed out, from the very inception of this scheme he has gone from one city to another and made a different statement in each of the six capitals. In Adelaide he told the people that he would make arrangements with the banks to pay the gratuity in cash. I presume that when he came back to Melbourne he met the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt), Mr. W.</inline> L. Baillieu, and a few other men prominent in commercial life, and they drew his attention to the stupidity of the statement He had made. When he went to Sydney he made quite a different proposal. What reliance can be placed on any statement made &#39;by the Prime Minister after that experience ? I will make this allowance for him, that an election was looming in the distance, and every man in political life, State or- Federal, rnakes statements during election times in the same way as the Prime Minister did. He is the most reckless politician in our public life in connexion with Federal finance, and it is most unfortunate for the people of Australia that we have as Prime Minister a man with those bad qualities. The returned soldiers were told at the last election that a gratuity would be granted to them, and this Parliament is bound to honour that promise. We are forced into that position, but it would be a mistake, and do a great deal of harm, to give the gratuity in the shape of bonds. I believe it was the honorable member for Adelaide who pointed out that the money could be raised within Australia to pay the gratuity. If we raised it here, and paid it to the soldiers, it would be put into circulation, and then there would be an opportunity for an income tax levy or a tax on capital. If we only had some financial genius on the Government side of the House, a plan could be put forward to pay a great proportion of the cost of the war out of revenue, as has been done in Great Britain. If the Government side cannot find sufficient ability among themselves to do this, let them appeal to the members of the Opposition, and they will furnish it. It is not the duty of the Opposition to lay their plans before the Government, and the Government cannot expect me or my party to give our brains away  to such incompetent men. They would simply mismanage the whole affair, and so defeat our object. The . figures regarding what Great Britain did during the war should interest all honorable members on the other side who desire to  study  this question properly. Our war debt must be wiped out. The State debts are in a very different position. They amount to &#163;300.000,000 odd, but much of that sum is represented by public utilities. That is a vastly different proposition from a war debt, which every country makes a start to liquidate immediately the war ends. We should do that. We should not be continually paying interest only to find, after the interest is paid, that we still have the full amount of the debt staring us in the face. On the 24th January of this year .the amount of the war expenditure of Great Britain was &#163;10,754,962,269. The net borrowing for war purposes was &#163;7,257,000,000, and &#163;3,503,000,000 was raised from revenue. Since the war Great Britain has raised &#163;S24,S55,56S from revenue. What have we done in Australia during the war to reduce our war debt? It was pointed out from this side of the House that the Government ought to prepare for peace as it ought to prepare for war; yet no steps were taken to do it. When the last war loan was raised I pointed out that there was money in circulation. Other honorable members referred to the extravagance of the people. We cannot prevent people from spending money when they have it, but we can compel them to pay taxation on the wealth that has been created by means of the expenditure of loan moneys. No one has made any attempt to deal with that aspect of the question. I am afraid that before very long some honorable members of the Country party will be obliged to hand over a portion of their capital for the purpose of wiping out the war debt. I have endeavoured to get honorable members to wake up to a sense of their responsibilities, and however nauseating my repetition of the misdeeds of the Government may be, I must keep on reminding them that the evil day must be met. In his private affairs no man would leave it to the last moment to prevent his bankruptcy; he would take every care to avoid placing himself in a position of humiliation. Yet, although our Government have been warned time after time to make preparation to Avoid the humiliation of the Commonwealth, they take no heed of the warning, and remain indifferent. &#39;Sooner or later it will be necessary for the country to meet its obligations, yet they do nothing. My long experience of political life leads me to gather from their proposal that these gratuity bonds shall not mature until 1924; that they hope, by hook or by crook, and the breaking of election pledges, to occupy their seats a little longer, and then leave it to the Labour party to get Australia out of its difficulties. They dare not impose a heavy income tax, because they know very well that it would be more likely to affect their own supporters than those who support honorable members on this side of the House. Thus it will be left to the Labour party to straighten up the affairs arising out of the war and out of the mismanagement of the present Government. No preparation is being made against the evil day. The only move made is simply to &#34; borrow, borrow, borrow.&#34; It seems to be an absolute fever, affecting not only the Commonwealth Government, but also the State Governments. As the result of the New South Wales elections a party is now going out of power which declined to impose taxation through the local governing bodies for the maintenance of roads, but preferred to borrow money for the purpose. I urge the Government and those supporting them to cease further borrowing. Loan money spent in Australia goes into the pockets of our citizens, and by means of taxes or a levy upon share capital or reserves, we have every justification for attacking these coffers, and so removing the loan incubus we have <inline font-style="italic">-on</inline> Australia at the present time. I appeal to honorable members supporting the Government to urge the payment of this gratuity in cash. </para>
        <para>When I press for a cash payment of this gratuity I am not asking for the payment of 35,000,000 sovereigns. I am merely urging the extension of the amount of credit to the men who fought so nobly for Australia and the Empire. Everybody recognises this country&#39;s marvellous power of production. Our primary production is already great, but our secondary industries are as yet only in their infancy. It has been estimated by a departmental officer that Australia can produce wealth to the extent of &#163;280,000,000 annually. Why, then, should we embark further upon loan enterprises ? I do trust that my appeal will have some weight with the Government. During the recent election campaign the Prime Minister distinctly stated that our returned soldiers were to be paid this gratuity in cash. Only last night, when I quitted the precincts of this building, I met two returned soldiers, and almost the first question which they asked me was, &#34; Has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> been successful in compelling the Government to pay cash?&#34; That is the question which is upon the lips of all our soldiers. Where is the utility  of offering these men bonds which are not negotiable? If we raise &#163;35.000,000 by loan in order to pay the gratuity, we shall have to pay interest upon it at the rate of 5^ per cent. Why should we not pay cash, and thus save that amount of interest? I ask the honorable member for Flinders to go down amongst lids chums&#39; in the Lane to-morrow morning and invite them to say whether my proposal is not a sound business one. </para>

These men were permanent officers in our Military Forces. They were the only soldiers in A.ustralia who were really military men.. Many of them endeavoured to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, but the Government refused ro entertain their applications. These men instructed the officers of the Australian Imperial Force who were trained in Australia prior to their departure for the Front. The salaries of these instructors amounted to  only  10s. or lis. per day, whereas the officers whom they trained were able, after passing the requisite examination, to command salaries of 20s. and 25s. per day. To quote the words of the Assistant Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Granville Ryrie),</inline> &#34; The good name of the Australian Imperial Force is largely due to the splendid instruction and training which the officers received at the hands of the Permanent Forces.&#34; I ask that these men shall receive the gratuity. </para>

        <para>That letter embodies a promise which the Government ought to keep. Promises made by the Prime Minister, however, are not of much value. </para>
        <para>Those members of the Permanent Forces who were permitted to enlist justified the action of the Government in allowing them to go to the Front. I find that out of twenty-nine permanent officers who enlisted twenty-four won distinctions. One permanent officer from </para>
        <para class="block">New South Wales was on service in France, and the British&#39; War Office thought so much of him that they recalled him and placed him in charge of Weymouth Camp.

Another permanent officer who enlisted received an O.P.E., two  won  the Military Cross, two secured the Distinguished Conduct Medal, two others received the Military Medal, and four won the <inline font-style="italic">Medaille Militaire.</inline> If other members of the Permanent Force had been allowed to go to the Front I am confident that they also would have secured honours. While they remained in Australia  they  did not receive more than lis. per day. They ought certainly to receive the war gratuity. I find that twenty-nine out of 115 members of the Engineers Corps who enlisted gained promotion. Two of them reached the rank of major, nine secured captaincies, sixteen were made lieutenants, and two sub-lieutenants. That is a creditable record. The members of our Permanent Forces are men of military capacity. Many of them have a love of military life, and have such high ideals that I am sure that had they been allowed to go to the Front they would have rendered valuable service to the Empire. My request that these men should receive some recognition is not unreasonable. </para>
        <para>Earlier in the session, I drew attention to the callous indifference of those in authority to the demands made upon them to deal with the problems relating to our loan policy. There appears to be a desire on their part to stave off the day of reckoning by raising further loans. In answer to a question which I put to the Treasurer, I received to-day a statement showing that the interest on loans paid by the Commonwealth up to 31st December, 1919, amounted to &#163;35.346,397. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> yesterday referred to the loan indebtedness of the States. He said that &#163;35,000,000 would fall due within the next two years, and that, instead of the 3&#163; per cent, interest payable in respect of them, it would probably be necessary to pay 6 per cent, for the renewals. Not only will this greatly increased rate of interest have to be paid, but the conversion loans may be floated at &#163;98, and, altogether, the cost of flotation will probably amount to another &#163;1,000,000. </para>
        <para class="block">This means that every man, woman, and child in Australia must contribute an additional 4s. a year to meet  the  increased cost of loans that have been in existence for some ten or fifteen years. Parliament should take these things into serious consideration. A sum of &#163;1,000,000 will be added to our expenditure, and our loans will still continue unpaid. I, perhaps, take more delight in dealing with these questions than do some other members of this House! Financial questions are considered very dry by some people, but the calculating mind enjoys their consideration. I am up to the tricks of politicians, and I know that honorable members opposite would like to be in a position ito accuse the Opposition of delaying the passing of this Bill. They will, however, admit that, if an honorable member believes that it is possible to meet in a certain way the expenditure involved in the passing of this measure, he should ventilate the views he holds concerning it. The financial position of the Commonwealth is worthy of serious consideration, as honorable members will learn if they read the Imperial <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or the financial journals. The position is giving considerable trouble in Great Britain with its 45,000,000 of people, and it i3 troubling me. It is not the nation in possession of the largest territory or having &#60;the largest population that will come best out of the war, but the nation which, wisely governed, makes the best use of industrial and primary production. I have tried to be a leader of the people, and have attempted to induce honorable members on the other side to tread the path that will lead to progress and help us out of our difficulties. I have always been optimistic rather than pessimistic, and I believe that the people of Australia can pay the gratuity to the soldiers in cash. If we can force &#60;the Government to adopt that course, we shall have done the right thing, and the future will confirm the wisdom of our action. Individually, I have no objection to being in Opposition, as members on this side are free to give expression .to their views; but, from the point of view of the proper administration of the government of Australia, I say that those who come directly from the masses of the people are better judges of their requirements, and of the course which should he followed to get the Commonwealth out of its present difficult position. &#34; Circumstances have placed us in the cold shades of Opposition, but that does not worry me at all. I love Australia, and I believe that our people will he able to meet their responsibilities. The wealth which some people in this country have accumulated since 1913 would be sufficient to pay half our war debt. It. is not right that the wealth of individuals should be increased in that way when the nation is at waT. The wealth of the country when it is at war should be used to meet the cost of its defence and its efforts in the cause of liberty and justice. The time has gone by for a policy of boom, borrow, and burst, and our children should not be called upon to pay off debts which we should have settled in our own life-time. We cannot pay off all our debts in one year, and I am not so foolish as to suggest any attempt &#39;to do so. The first step we should take should be towards the liquidation of our war debt, and the next should be to abandon further borrowing, and to take revenue from those who have wealth - in my view, obtained unjustly, though I do not suggest that it has been unjustly obtained in a criminal sense. </para>
        <para>Honorable members must realize the financial position, but I see no indication on the part of the Government that they intend to discontinue the borrowing policy. I do not think that if a referendum of the people had been taken they would have been found to be agreeable to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> going to Great Britain in her hour of trouble to ask for assistance in meeting Australia&#39;s financial obligations. We ought to strike out for ourselves, and prove ourselves worthy of our nationhood. I believe we can raise the money in Australia without making any appeal abroad. The Government did not give any serious consideration to the mission of the Treasurer, but his departure from Australia at this time is more serious than may appear at first sight. Had the Government meditated on the question they would  have realized the necessity for keeping in Australia the Treasurer and the Under-Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins),</inline> who are better acquainted with the financial affairs of the country than is any other honorable member on the Government side. The Treasurer deserves a holiday, and I hope he will return restored to health ; but eight or nine months must elapse before then, and that may involve a delay in the presentation of the Budget. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> is Acting Treasurer, but I do not like to say what I think about him as a financier. If he were half a Christian he would admit that he is not a financial genius. He may manage the Department of the Navy very well, but I do not think that he would claim ability to carry the heavy responsibilities of getting Australia out of its financial difficulties. </para>

            <para>- I offer that observation with no intention of being disrespectful to the Minister, who has never posed as a financial expert. I have read that the Treasurer is to attempt to borrow &#163;20,000,000 or &#163;30,000,000. Parliament has not been consulted in regard to that loan, and I am opposed to borrowing abroad, because if money is borrowed within Australia the interest is paid to our own people, and our bank balance remains practically the same always; but when we send out of Australia &#163;1,000,000 in interest, that money is lost to the country. The same thing occurs with regard to the old-age pensions. The Treasury pays the pension on Thursday, and I swear that not half-a-dozen of the 60,000 pensioners would be found with any money in their pockets on the Saturday; the money has all passed into circulation again. I was one of those who urged <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> when Treasurer, to float the first Avar loan in Australia. He was nervous about raising &#163;20,000,000 in Australia, and I admit that I was, too. Honorable members opposite laughed at that feature of Labour finance, but during the war we proved that we could raise money in Australia, and the interest on ourborrowings was paid to our own people. </para>

What a Government we have got; they are a lot of rotters to give me a piece of paper that nobody will accept!&#34; To prevent discontent, and to prove that we do appreciate the work which the soldiers have done, we should make a cash payment to them. If they are given a non-negotiable bond they will be cursing and damning when they find they cannot negotiate it. I know their sentiments. I receive letters from them, and have frequent callers at my home to inquirewhen the gratuity will be paid. I reply, &#34; Ask me something easy.

            <para>.- I do not apologize for speaking at this late hour. I wish to draw attention to the statement made in another place by the Minister representing the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> with respect to the invalid and old-age pensions. The question was asked whether provision would be made to enable blind pen,sioners to earn at least &#163;2 a week without any deduction being made from their pension payments, and the Minister said the matter was under consideration, and that a decision would be come to at an early date. I hope that full justice will be done to these people so unfortunately situated in life, and who have to contend equally with the exorbitant prices in the cost of living. One blind pensioner I know of is getting only &#163;2 ls. per week, including a 50 per cent, bonus; another &#163;2 12s.; and another &#163;1 13s. 6d. A basket-maker with thirty years&#39; experience, and with a 50 per cent, bonus, is only averaging &#163;2 4s. 9d. per week. Each of these persons is married, with dependent families. Blind soldiers are allowed to earn &#163;4 per week with a house allowance. I trust, therefore, that the claims of the inmates of our blind institutions to be able to earn sufficient to place them in a better financial position than at present will be considered, and that the existing restrictions with respect to earnings will be removed, so that their income may more closely approach a- living wage. I understand that the average earning capacity of a blind person is only one-third that of a person with his sight. I may also refer to the case of an old-age pensioner named Ophelia Martin, of Kapunda. She is, I believe, the widow of the person who was a member of the party that conveyed provisions for the Burke and Wills Expedition. This lady owns a house valued at &#163;150, from which she receives 7s. 6d. per week- </para>
