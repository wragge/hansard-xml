            <para>- Prior to theadjournment of the House on Friday last, it was agreed that the address to  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales should be presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in the Library, no arrangement at that time having been made by another place for the adoption of an address. A special meeting was, however, subsequently summoned for this evening for that purpose, and, owing to the method of procedure proposed , to be adopted there, it became advisable, in the opinion of the Government, tovary the programme regarding the place of presentation, which, in the altered circumstances, it was thought ought to be this chamber. I therefore, at the request of the Prime Minister, summoned this special meeting for. the purpose. </para>

Should an interval elapse before the arrival of  His  Hoyal Highness, I may temporarily vacate the chair, resuming it whenthe Prince is approaching. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister will announce the arrival of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, whereupon I shall welcome  His  Royal Highness, and invite him to take a seat on the dais beside the Speaker&#39;s chair. On the entrance of the Prince, and during his presence in the chamber, honorable members will be invited to stand. I shall then read the Address of Welcome, to which HisRoyal Highness will make a reply. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister will then move &#34; That the House do now adjourn,&#34; which motion being carried, I shall ask Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Country party, the other members then present, and the officers of the House, to come forward to be presented. After presentation, they will pass behind the Speaker&#39;s chair, and thence into the Queen&#39;s Hall, to take their places at the dining table, prior to&#39; the Prince entering the Hall. I, with the Prime Minister, will then accompany  His  Royal Highness to the door of the House. </para>

          <para>. - These pleasant proceedings make a break in the continuity of our sittings, and require that we should pass again two motions which, because of this happy bringingtogether of the House, have lapsed. Honorable member&#39;s will recollect that before we adjourned on Friday two proposals were brought before the House and carried, one giving leave of absence to honorable members until the calling together of the House, and the other adjourning the. House until summoned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> These now lapse, and must be re-passed to become effective. I accordingly move - </para>

Highness was animated was shared to the full by Australia&#39;s sons and daughters, who by their valour and their sacrifices contributed a worthy part to the ultimate triumph of those principles which are the glory and the pride of the British name. &#34; Your progress throughout the Commonwealth will afford Your Royal Highness an opportunity of observing the energy, enterprise, and character of our people in the pursuit of the arts of peace. &#34;We earnestly trust that your visit to our shores may be fraught with happiness and pleasure to Your Royal Highness, and that your mission to our people may be blessed with an abundant measure of success to the present and enduringadvantage of Australia and the Empire.&#34; </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, &#34; I deeply appreciate the cordial address of welcome which you have presented to me, and I shall be happy to assure my father, the King, of your devotion to his. Throne. The Australian nation has passed through nineteen years of development since  His  Majesty inaugurated the first Australian Parliament; but the severest of all ordeals has come upon you in the last five years, and splendidly you stood the test. I congratulate you, and through you all the great people which you represent, on your gallant services to the cause of freedom and right during the long world-war. It is a pleasure to me to know that some of my old acquaintances in the field are now amongst you here. &#34; I shall be grateful, gentlemen, if you will let me express through you to all the Commonwealth my keen pleasure at being here in Australia at last. I have long looked forward to this visit, and the magnificent welcome accorded me has made the happiest possible beginning for my tour. I hope that I may see many of you again during my travels through the Commonwealth.&#34; </para>
