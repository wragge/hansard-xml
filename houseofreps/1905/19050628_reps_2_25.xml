            <para>- The agreement recently arrived at at Hobart  covered the whole of the rates that were regarded as unconstitutional. We have received promises from the States Governments that action will be taken to give effect to the agreement. This course has already been adopted in some of the States, and similar action is to be taken in other States on the 1st July. Until I am in receipt of information as to what has actually been done, I cannot reply with exactness to the question of the honorable member. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question with reference to a matter of urgency, which was brought under the notice of the Tariff Commission whilst sitting in Brisbane. It was represented that the local Collector of Customs had issued what were called permits to Chinese and others to sell opium, and that under such permits opium in large quantities was being placed within the reach of aboriginals. A request was made that immediate instructions should be issued to the Collector of Customs to cancel all these permits. I desire to know whether the Minister will cause an inquiry to be made, and whether, in the event of its being shown that such permits have been issued, he will at once cause them to be cancelled ? </para>

            <para>- I think there must be some misunderstanding with regard to this matter. Under the States Administrations, the Collectors of Customs were in the habit of issuing permits ; but under the Commonwealth control no such authority can be given. The issue of permits has long since been discontinued. </para>

            <para>- In answer to the honorable member, I may say that the plans of the proposed new electoral divisions in Victoria are ready,  with the exception of one map, which, I believe, will be completed by to-morrow. That is the reason they were not laid upon the table today. I may as well state - although the honorable member has not asked the question - that as regards the proposed new boundaries of the Western Australian electorates, a letter has been received, advising the forwarding of the plans and maps, but they have not reached me. I expect to receive them by the next mail. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister further intimated in that address that if the Opposition were not prepared to deal with the non-contentious measures which he proposed to submit, the situation which would then arise would have to be seriously considered by himself and his colleagues. Since that speech was made, events have undergone a change. We have had a. notable deliverance from the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. We all remember how active he was in the formation of the Coalition Government which now occupies the Treasury Benches, and it must be clear to every one who has carefully read his recent declaration, that as far as the Ministry are concerned, they can no longer consider him the warm and cordial friend and supporter that he was prior to making that speech. </para>

            <para>- The speech of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat pointed to no alliance of any sort. The only conclusion at which I can arrive from a perusal of his address is that by withdrawing his support from the Coalition Government he desires to bring about a return to the three-party system of Government which was introduced into this House some time ago. Nobody who feels keenly in connexion with our representative institutions wishes to see a return to that system, which undoubtedly degraded those institutions. Under these conditions the Government, composed as it is of men of high standing in our public life, naturally had&#39; to seriously consider the position. It is clear from the Vice-Regal speech that they have done so. AH the measures which were forecasted by the Prime Minister at Hawthorn have been placed upon one side, and the Government now propose to deal with one matter only, which everybody will agree is a matter of pressing urgency - I refer to the Redistribution of Seats Bill. </para>

            <para>- He wanted to have a look at the honorable member. That a redistribution of seats is necessary, must be patent to everybody. As time has elapsed, the inequalities which were proved to exist when the first distribution of electorates took place have increased. To-day they are of such a glaring character that, in order to insure a proper representation under the liberal franchise which exists in Australia, it is necessary that we should have a Redistribution of Seats Bill passed at the earliest possible moment. That fact is recognised, not only by the Government, but by every right-thinking person in the community. In some quarters a great outcry has been raised, because, under the redistribution scheme &#39; which is projected, Victoria will be represented by one member less, and New South Wales by one member more. What is the real position, and what is the reason for the great outcry which has occurred in that connexion ? When the first distribution of electoral divisions for the Commonwealth Parliament took place Victoria obtained her twenty-, third representative by having 1,135 Per&#34; sons in excess of half the quota. In the second distribution which took place in 1903, that State secured her twenty-third representative because she possessed 2,280 in excess of half the quota. The statistics for 1905 show that half the quota necessary to entitle a State to return a representative is 27,443, and that Victoria has 24,631 less than half the quota, or only 2,812 persons in excess of the number required to return twenty-two representatives. What is the position in regard to New South Wales? In 1900 and 1903. that State returned twenty-six representatives upon the full quota. There was no bare allowance in the case of that State.  Her  representatives were returned upon the full quota in every instance. According to the official figures for 1905, she is entitled to an additional member,, because the figures show that she has 2,767 above half the quota. When Victoria, in the first instance, obtained her twenty-third member she had only 1,135 persons over the half quota, while in the second instanceshe had only 2,280 over half the quota; but in neither case was objection raised by any one </para>

            <para>-  There was) no grumbling on the part of honorable members from any of the other States. But now that New South Wales has more than half the quotaentitling her to an additional member, namely, 2^767, as against the 1,135 &#39;n the first instance, and the 2,280 persons in thesecond, upon which Victoria obtained her twenty-third member, we hear grumblingsin certain quarters1 in connexion with the proposed redistribution. In the interests of the proper representation, not merely of New South Wales, but of the whole Commonwealth, it is absolutely necessary that there shall be a redistribution. In order to give effect to our democratic franchise, and&#34; to secure proper representation in this House, so that we shall have, as nearly as possible, equality in the matter of one adult one vote throughout the Commonwealth, it is imperative that every honorable member should recognise that it is his duty to support the position assumed by the Government, and to help them to pass a Bill for the redistribution of seats. I have nothing further to add. I have dealt with the only matter referred to in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech, and I trust that it will receive the proper consideration of the House. I commend the Government for the manly, straightforward, honest stand they have taken up, and feel satisfied that it will receive the commendation of every rightthinking man and woman in Australia. </para>

          <para>- In rising to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, I may say that, like the honorable and learned member for Illawarra, I intend to be brief, because I think that  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech leaves very little for me to say. The only matter with which it deals is the proposal of the Government to bring in a measure for the redistribution of seats; and, apart altogether from the question of whether any State should have the number of its representatives varied, I think it is essential that the States should be divided into something like equal electorates. If we are to have one adult one vote, the corollary is that there shall be one vote one power. It is not in accordance with such a Constitution as is ours that one honorable member should represent more than double the number of the electors to be found in practically an adjoining electorate. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking of the Constitution as it stands. It has given the States a certain measure of representation, and every one who is familiar with the difficulties surrounding the erection of the Federal Constitution knows that, without equal representation in the Senate, there would have been no Federation today. It is essential that a proper redistribution of seats, shall take place before an appeal is made to the country. I regret, however, that any State should lose a proportion of the representation which it has enjoyed, and I hope that when the population statistics are counted or recounted, it will be found that Victoria will not have to part with any of her existing measure of representation. It is deplorable that in a young community like that of Australia any State should lose a proportion of its representation on account of a decrease of its population, and I hope that such a contingency will not arise. As to the position which the Government has taken up, I must say that they have my hearty congratulations. There has never been a Government in office with a majority at their back since my election to this House, and the majority supporting the present Ministry has always been small. Indeed, if my advice had been taken - for what it was worth - the course they now intend to pursue would have been followed when a crisis occurred on a prior occasion. When I first entered this Chamber the Deakin Government, who were then in office, had not a majority, and, indeed, they did not at any time have a majority behind them. We had then three parties in the House, and each was practically as strong as that behind the Government. When the Watson Government took office, they had very little more than one-third of the honorable members of this Chamber sitting behind them. It was really impossible for either the Deakin Government, or the Watson Government, to pass practical legislation, to control the House, or to govern the country. As long as the honorable and learned member for Ballarat remained faithful to the agreement entered into between his party and that led by the present Prime Minister, the position was different. That agreement was an honorable and proper one, and I believe that it had the support of a majority of honorable members. Although I confess that I have been unable to thoroughly grasp the exact attitude taken up by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat in his recent address to his constituents, it must be patent to every one who has perused the reports of that address, that the. loyal agreement entered into between the two parties has, so far as the leaders are concerned, terminated. They have reached the parting . of the ways. There is no one who would have received more abuse than the Prime- </para>

        <para class="block">Minister would have done had he come down to the House with a proposal to attempt to carry on when his majority had practically gone. The very honorable members who are now attempting to deride his action would have been foremost in abusing and challenging him to take up the very position that he has now assumed. What is the  objection which some honorable members have been taking, both in the lobbies, and whilst the honorable and learned member for Illawarra was speaking? It is urged that the Prime Minister has indicated a course which he cannot himself carry out. It would be useless to deny that it is not in the power of any Minister, or any Government, to command a dissolution. It is not in the power of any Ministry to say that they will not exert themselves to remain in office, and that the moment they retire there will be a dissolution. The position which the Prime Minister has taken up is thoroughly in accord with the highest traditions of constitutional government. When the Ministry of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat failed to hold a majority, they retired, and when the Watson Government failed to carry a majority, they also retired. I believe that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat on leaving office did not apply for a dissolution, but we know that the present leader of the Opposition did, and I think that he was to be commended for his action. That being the position, what objection can there be to the proposal of the Prime Minister to make a proper and above-board provision to enable him to apply for a dissolution if he cannot hold a majority ? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member will have an alternative programme, and I sincerely trust that it will be more clearly defined than was the programme which some honorable members of the Opposition put forward, the result being that during the last three months they have been running about the country attempting to explain that they did not mean it. When I read a speech delivered recently by the leader of the Opposition, it recalled to my mind one of the most clever cartoons I have ever seen. I refer to a cartoon which appeared in Lon don <inline font-style="italic">Punch,</inline> and has been considered one of the few worthy of preservation. As honorable members are aware, when John Russell sought to put back the hands of the clock, so far as Catholic emancipation was concerned, he ran through the country attempting to explain his proposal. This led <inline font-style="italic">Punch</inline> to bring out an exceedingly clever cartoon depicting John Russell, after putting up &#34; No Popery &#34; on the wall, flying for his life. I think that is exactly the position of the ex-Prime Minister - the present leader of the Opposition - for, having written up &#34; Socialism &#34; on the walls of the Commonwealth, he has been engaged during the last three months in touring the country, and attempting to explain that what he proposed was really not Socialism, or, if it was, it was such a little bit of Socialism, that, after all, it was not worth&#39; considering. Australia has come to this position : The present Parliament has been in existence for eighteen months, and, so far as practical legislation - legislation for the benefit of Australia - is concerned, the results have been to a very great extent <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> The Prime Minister would have deserved that which honorable members opposite would have said most vehemently of him, if he had. sought to mark time to the end of this session, and then, perhaps, have attempted to sneak through the next session with a majority which he could not command. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that the members of the Opposition would like to get the Prime Minister out of office without giving the electors of Australia a chance to express their views on the situation. What objection can there be to any Government saying, &#34; We appeal over the head of the Parliament to our masters, and to the masters of the Parliament&#34;? Honorable members know that I do not hold the extreme free-trade views which are held by many in this House. I did not come into this House as a pledged supporter of the Reid Government. </para>

            <para>- But I have never ran out of the Chamber fearing to give a vote. The electors declared by a very substantial majority that the Tariff should not be re-opened, that there should be fiscal peace ; and, therefore, I say that before the Tariff is touched, we should go to those who sent us here, to get their opinion, and their permission to alter what has been done. If the socialistic platform is one which should be adopted by Parliament, surely honorable members opposite cannot object to the giving of an opportunity for its indorsement by the electors. </para>

            <para>- Then, why does he cry for the resignation of the Government instead of for a dissolution ? If the Tariff is to be revised, there should first be a mandate from the people of Australia, expressed through the ballot-box ; while if the socialistic programme is to be carried through Parliament, it must be brought in at the front door, by the ballot-box, and not at the back door by means of some vote or combination. </para>

            <para>- The leader of the Opposition need not take my remarks as personal. But what valid objection can he or his party have to the indorsement of their policy by the people of Australia, before its presentation to Parliament for acceptance? Under these circumstances, 1 think that the Prime Minister is to be congratulated on the manly and constitutional course which he has taken, by declaring that on the day when he cannot carry a living programme through Parliament he will appeal to the electors to see whether his policy will or will not receive their indorsement. </para>
