            <para>-  I shall not move any amendment in that part of the definition at the present time. I think, however, that there should be inserted in this clause a definition, which, for a reason which has not been explained, has been omitted. The Minister in charge of a Bill should be perfectly candid as regards the scope of the measure. The Committee looks to him for guidance. If a definition which appears in the English legislation, upon which this Bill is professedly based, has been left out, we should be told why it has been left out. I find, however, that a definition which appeared in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Moulton&#39;s</inline> Bill of 1904, which was largely drawn upon by the draftsman of this measure, and has been enacted in the Act which comes into operation on the 1st April, 1906, does not appear in the Bill. If that definition had been adopted by the draftsman, the trade union label provisions could not come within the scope of the measure, so that it appears to me that the omission was deliberate. </para>

            <para>- I am merely pointing out that the draftsman has deliberately omitted a definition which appears in the English legislation, and I assume that, being a man of ability, he knew what he was doing. As the Bill professedly follows the English legislation on the subject, the significance of the definition to which I refer must have been known. It is somewhat curious, therefore, seeingthat it would have involved a&#39; limitation of the scope of the measure, which would have excluded the trade union label provisions, that it has been left out. I do not say who is to blame. I merely mention the fact, and leave honorable members to draw their own conclusions. </para>

            <para>- I do not remember that the Attorney-General mentioned this omis-  sion from the Bill. Perhaps it would! be as well to remind honorable members of the real object of trade marks, because that question will affect the constitutionality of this Bill, if it ever becomes law. I do not wish to repeat my former arguments at any length, but I should like to direct attention to the fact that, according to judicial decisions, the object of trade marks is to indicate that the registered proprietor of a trade mark is such by virtue of manufacture, selection, certification, dealing with or offering for sale. <inline font-style="italic">Sebastian</inline> says that a trade mark is - both a sign of the quality of the article, and an assurance to the public that it is the genuine product of his manufacture. </para>

        <para class="block">So that by virtue of the fact that it is the registered proprietor&#39;s trade mark, the public may assume that the goods are of a certain quality and finish. No such assumption could be based on a trade union label. I do not say that the work turned out by union workmen may not be of a very excellent character. The fact that they are paid higher wages should insure better work, because, as a rule, the better the wages, the more satisfactory the product of the workmen. The union label would not necessarily indicate anything so far as quality or finish are concerned, whereas the object of the trade mark is to afford these guarantees to the public. </para>

            <para>- The quality cannot be indicated on the trade mark itself, but its object is to show that the goods are the product of a particular manufacturer or trader whose business standing as one who has always turned out goods of firstclass finish and quality gives some assurance to the public that they are getting value for their money. No such guarantee can be given by a union label. All that is  conveyed  is that the goods are made bv workmen who are members of the trade union. The employer could have no right to a trade mark, except for the purposes I have indicated. </para>

The insertion of &#34;the words &#34;or Judge&#34; in the first paragraph of the clause, makes a distinction between Justices of the High Court and Judges of the Supreme Courts. . The Attorney-General knows that the Supreme Court Justices are so termed, and I should be satisfied if the words &#34; or Judge &#34; were left out. There was no intention on the part of this Parliament, when creating the High Court, to deprive the Supreme Court Justices of any of their titles. I know that their Honours appreciate the use of the word ^&#39;Justice&#34; instead of &#34;Judge.&#34; The AttorneyGeneral is not to blame in this matter, because the same wording was1 adopted when the Bill was submitted to Parliament last year.

            <para>-  Yes, but over and over again we have included definitions in Acts in order to prevent trouble. It is necessary to adopt the amended definition I propose, because under the Acts Interpretation Act whilst &#34; person &#34; would include a body corporate it would not include a firm. If a particular firm wished to register a trade mark the mere use of the word &#34;person &#34; would not give them that right. </para>

            <para>- I think not. I think we ought to define trade mark before we define the class of trade mark with which we are proposing to deal. That is what is done in English legislation. When I found that the draftsman had adopted another method I did not at first propose to interfere with it, but I have since recognised the importance of moving my amendment out of its alphabetical order. I have already quoted one or two definitions of &#34; trade mark,&#34; in order to show what objects such&#39; marks are intended to achieve. I now wish to refer to the judgment of Lord Esher in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Richards</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Butcher,</inline> 1891, II.

            <para>- I think that it would be very proper to question the constitutionality of making any such provision in that Bill. But in England, where the question of constitutionality could not arise, Lord Halsbury &#39;s dictum to the effect that a label is not necessarily a trade mark cannot be questioned. But what is claimed in this case is virtually a copyright. Under the Imperial Trade Marks Act of 1905, if a person be an expert examiner of goods, he can register his trade mark. That is the only exception made by recent English legislation. </para>

            <para>- I am endeavouring to bring the Bill into harmony with the latest English legislation. The earlier English Acts dealing with this subject contained no definitions. Itis true that there was a definition in one Act which was incorporated with the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, only for the purposes of that Act, but there was no definition in what are known as the Registration Acts, and the&#39; measure under consideration is, in essence, a Registration Bill. The English Bill of 1904, However, did include a well-drawn definition, which is embodied in the Act of 1905. That definition, I think, was suggested after an examination of the Bill by experts. I believe that a Committee of the House of Commons inquired into this matter in 1904-5, so that the amendments made by recent legislation were made with great deliberation-- </para>

            <para>- There is no doubt of that. I have examined the evidence which . was taken by that Committee, and I can see that the amendments which have been  made in the earlier English legislation have been deliberately made with the object of bringing the trade marks legislation of the old country right up to date. Honorable members, I think, will recognise the effect of omitting from this Bill the definition which I propose to insert, and which reads - </para>

        <para class="block">I say that the effect of inserting that definition will be to confine -the Bill to its proper scope, so that it shall deal only with trade marks which are truly such, in that they indicate, as I have already mentioned, ownership of goods, in the sense defined, or expert examination of goods. The omission of this definition may have been accidental. But when one looks at other portions of a Bill,, and finds that a similar accident has led to a like result there, one is naturally inclined to be a little suspicious of the object which the draftsman had in view. For instance, clause 16, which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, provides - </para>

Some people would be inclined to surmise that these words have been inserted - ignoring the later English legislation - in order to fit in with the union label clause. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps it is ; and if so, it is the duty of the Attorney-General to set me right. However, I intend to deal with the points as they present themselves to me. I am referring now to the essential particulars of trade marks, and the Attorney-General is alluding to the definition of &#34; mark,&#34; in the interpretation section of the English Act. I say that the word &#34; distinctive &#34; is not included in that Act as a special definition of distinctive mark. </para>

            <para>- The word &#34; distinctive,&#34; as it is used in the English Act, accomplishes practically the same result as does the definition of trade mark in this Bill. It indicates that the proprietor of a distinctive mark is also the proprietor of the goods. The definition is not inserted in the English Act amongst the general definitions, but it is specially included in section 9 which deals with the essential particulars of trade marks, and which reads - </para>

I say that in this Bill we shall practically legalize the union label without the special clauses to be subsequently moved. The measure, in -the &#39;form in which it has been modified by the draftsman, covers a wider scope than should be covered by a Trades Marks Bill. I wish to confine the measure to its proper scope, and to make its provisions constitutional. </para>

I fail to understand why honorable members should be, so anxious to give a legal status to union labels - to legalize them in the sense of affording protection against the infringement of their copyright. </para>

            <para>- There is no necessity for the introduction of these labels into Australia, such as may be said to exist in America. Wherever arbitration Acts are in force in Australia, unions have acquired such- a status that \they do not require this principle to be inserted in the Bill. The old unions might disappear, and as long as they remained organizations under the Arbitration Act labour would not be any the worse off. </para>

            <para>- I am willing to adopt, that suggestion. My idea is that a general  discussion at this stage would expedite the debate; but if it will suit the purpose of the Government to have a separate debate on the union label provisions, I shall offer no objection. At the same time, I feel that I am perfectly in order in making a general reference to other clauses. When I say that the status of unions in Australia is exceptionally high, I do not mean to suggest that I should not like to see a further improvement, if they were capable of improvement ; but they have mutual rights against one another which are not enjoyed by unions in England. In the United States, fierce disputes between capital and labour have been brought about chiefly by an attempt - which has been declared by the Supreme Court of America to be constitutional - on the part of employers to frame agreements excluding non-unionists from employment. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member has not stated his amendment, but is discussing the relations between employers and employ&#233;s on a clause which, so far as I can see, provides no such subject for discussion. I would point out that we are discussing the definition, and that the Bill up to the stage which we have reached, does not contain any reference to union marks. Indeed, a reference to &#34; trade union marks &#34; has been struck out of a preceding clause. If the honorable and learned member wishes to deal with&#39; trade union marks, it will be necessary for him&#34; to move a substantive motion to cause the re-insertion of that reference, if he desires to deal with them at this stage: </para>

That question can be more properly discussed when the provisions in question are before us. </para>

Surely the honorable and learned member is not only entitled, but bound, in fairness to the Committee, to give his reasons for proposing the insertion of a definition which will have the limiting effect that he has pointed out.

That is absolutely germane to the amendment.

            <para>-  In relation to the question which the honorable and learned member is arguing, there is one point which to my mind is fatal. Even if we inserted the definition which the honorable and learned member for Angas proposes, providing in effect that &#34; trade mark&#34; shall not include trade union marks, it would not carry us any further, because we find at the beginning of clause 4, the words, &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended. &#34; Therefore, the amendment would not apply to another part of the Bill where the clear intention was to the contrary. It is useless, to contend that reasons may be given why the definition in this clause will or will not include anything else, because it would be perfectly open to us, under the interpretation clause, to insert anything else that we .please, unless it is otherwise clearly intended. Those words govern the whole matter. My next point is, that whilst the honorable and learned member might be at liberty to show what the amendmentwould include, and what it would not, he has really been roaming all over the Bill. </para>

          <para>The union label has during the past ten or fifteen years become an increasingly common device among labour organizations to influence consumers to buy union made goods, and thus to induce employers to use exclusively union labour. Nearly all of the States have adopted statutes allowing the registration of .union labels and trade marks, and providing for the punishment of persons using these labels without authority. Statutes of this sort, of course, differ from the ordinary laws regarding trade marks, since the union working man is not the owner of the article to which he affixes the label, but simply contributes his labour towards its manufacture. </para>

        <para class="block">According to the report of the Commission, trade union labels are not considered trade marks, and consequently Congress has not legislated in respect to them, because its power of legislation extends only to trade marks.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HIGGINS</inline>(Northern Melbourne).I should like to explain to the honorable and learned member for Angas that the Bill was drafted about fifteen months ago, before the English definition to which he has referred existed. Therefore it is hardly fair to blame the Attorney -General for its omission, especially as he had nothing to do with the drafting of the measure. I understand that the honorable and learned member wishes to insert the definition of a trade mark which is embodied in the English Trade Marks Act, passed on the nth August of this year. It is true that there is not a definition of a trade mark in the Bill, but there is a definition of the essentials of a registrable trade mark, so that what is needed is achieved, I think, as well here as in the English Act. Therefore, in my opinion, the Attorney -General is wise in not agreeing to amend the Bill, since it has already passed through the Senate, and we wish to reduce the points of difference between the two Chambers to a minimum. As the Attorney-General has pointed out, the English definition applies only &#34;unless the context otherwise requires,&#34; and our definition applies only &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended.&#34; The English Act contains a provision, to which the honorable and learned member for Angas did not refer, recognising the full principle of the trade union label. </para>

        <para class="block">So that an association may own a trade mark, although it does not own or make the goods to which it is applied. That is the whole principle at issue. It is like the system of giving hall-mark by search. The manufacturers of Sheffield are interested in keeping up the standard of Sheffield goods, and for two or three centuries past have adopted a system of search. Searchers go through the goods, and ascertain whether they are worthy of having the hall-mark attached to them. The union label would be similar to a hall-mark, to the extent to which it would afford a guarantee as to the standard of the goods. </para>

In section 63 provision is made similar to that adopted in regard to the Sheffield marks ; and in section 64 provision is made similar to that which applies to cotton marks in Manchester and other places. If we adopt the definition pro posed by the honorable and learned member for Angas, we shall only lead to confusion, and I think we should be well advised if we disposed of the formal clauses as quickly as possible, and dealt with the question of union labels, as it will arise under Part VII. of the Bill. </para>

If we were to adopt the definition proposed by the honorable and learned member for Angas, it would be competent for us to deal in this measure with all those matters which would come within the meaning of &#34; trade marks &#34; under the Constitution. The definition has been framed&#39; so as to give the widest possible scope to the meaning of &#34; trade mark.&#34; It is very wide, but very clear and distinct. It seems to me that an attempt is being made to usurp jurisdiction that we do not possess under the Constitution. Our only power of legislation in regard to trade marks is conferred under section 51 of the Constitution, and if the provisions relating to union labels cannot be brought within the definition of &#34;trade marks,&#34; as that term is used in the Constitution, any legislation that we may pass on the subject will be absolutely useless. </para>

            <para>- If members of the unions like to associate themselves together as co-operative bodies for manufacturing purposes, they will be perfectly entitled to register a trade mark and apply it to the goods they produce, as is now done by some of the larger co-operative societies. It isa mistake to suppose that the trade marks provisions pure and simple are intended for the protection of employers only. The employes will have the same privilege that will attach to employers, so long as they can claim the ownership of the goods to which the trade mark is to be applied. The Bill proposes, however, to adopt a principle which will conflict- with the rights of the owners, of the goods. It is proposed to give to a body of men the power to affix a label to certain goods, because they have been at one stage or another engaged in their production. It- might be possible to affix thirty labels to some classes of goods. We should define the meaning of &#34; trade mark,&#34; firstly, in order that we may know where we stand, and, secondly, with a view to avoiding litigation. I would urge the Attorney-General to accept the amendment, because the definition would be wide&#39; enough to embrace every provision that could possibly be said to relate to trade marks. Any omission of a definition will not enable us to include within the scope of the Bill provisions for union: labels, if they cannot be said to come under the head of trade marks. The inclusion of union label provisions in a measure of thiskind might be attended with some disadvantage if the matter came up for argument before the High Court. If it were held that union labels, did not come within the definition of trade marks, it would not becompetent for those who were representing, the unions to argue that they might be brought within the scope of the Copyright. Act. If, however, union labels were provided for in a distinct Bill, counsel might 0 argue that they could be registered under the Copyright Act. If the AttorneyGeneral had desired to secretly defeat the union label clauses, he could not haveadopted any more effective method than that he has followed. A lot of cooperativebodies to-day are using distinctive trademarks. Consequently, to describe the proposal under discussion as legislation which: is .solely in the interests of the employersis to confess an absolute misunderstanding of the purpose of the Bill. If the proposed definition be accepted, Ave shall knowexactly where we are. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the honorable member is wrong. The Attorney - General himself is unable to say what is the scope of some of the subsequent clauses, and the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne occupies a similar position in respect of other provisions. I venture to say that if we do not adopt the proposal under consideration, within a few years, we shall find the funds of the unions absorbed in law suits. The Attorney-General is well aware that any litigation in connexion with trade marks usually involves an expenditure of from&#163;500 to&#163;2,000. If by our legislation we foster such litigation, within a comparatively brief period the whole of the funds of the unions will be dissipated in that way. </para>

            <para>- When I asked the honorable member to assist me to provide cheap law - I refer to the time when the Judiciary Bill was under discussion - he failed to grasp the position. Is it not wise that we should make our meaning in legislative enactments so clear that he who runs may read? By declining to accept this definition, we shall increase litigation, and that should be the last desire of honorable members. I specially appeal to the Labour corner in connexion with this matter. If they are really anxious to pass legislation dealing with the question of the union label, realizing the difficulty that may arise in regard to its constitutionality, they should be especially careful to see that its application is not limited by the scope of the particular Bill in which it is embodied. </para>

            <para>- If we accept this definition some of the clauses will clearly be outside the order of leave. It may be open to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to say, &#34; I cannot rule this or that out of order,  and  therefore it may be inserted;&#34; but the High Court will confine itself to the consideration of the power which we possess to deal with these matters. If the High Court held the union label clauses to be outside the Constitution, nothing that we might do would help us. That is one of the difficulties with which the Attorney-General has been confronted in taking up those clauses, and I think that he has made a mistake. It would be wise for the Committee to accept the amendment, as it would render litigation to determine the effect of our legislation in this respect wholly unnecessary. Unless we have a  clear  definition of &#34; trade mark,&#34; it will be impossible to say whether many of the subsequent clauses relate to trade marks or union labels. The Committee, however, does not  appear  to be prepared to give any consideration to this point, and two or three years hence I shall be able once more to show that another blunder has been committed by the Parliament. We are entering upon an evil course in refusing to define what we mean. If the question be left for the determination of the High Court, thousands of pounds of the workers&#39; </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi- Attorney-General). - I shouldlike to make one or two observations regarding , the amendment. I take it that it is our duty when, as a Federal Parliament, we seek to cover the whole ground relating to trade marks - so that there shall be no collision between State and Federal legislation on the subject - to see that we do cover the whole ground. It is for this reason that we use the words &#34; trade marks.&#34; When we simply use those words, we cover whatever ground the Constitution gives us in this regard, and do not leave any room for doubt as to there being only a portion of the field touched bythe Commonwealth Legislature, and another portion occupied by the States. I take it that the object of the framers of the Constitution in giving us this power, was to enable us, if we legislated at all in regard to the question, to so legislate as to cover the whole field and secure uniformity. It is for this reason that we have not given any definition. We cannot extend the meaning of the words &#34;trade marks&#34; as used in the Constitution, and we certainly do not wish to limit it. A definition is an excellent thing when the Parliament has power to cover as wide a field as it pleases, or to limit the scope of its law to whatever extent it chooses; but whatever may be the meaning of the words &#34; trade marks &#34; as used in the Constitution, we cannot go beyond it, and we have, therefore, refrained from inserting in this Bill an interpretation of those words. When I use the word &#34; we&#34; I have no desire to claim credit for myself; credit is due really to the draftsman. The Bill was framed, not by the late Government, but by their predecessors, and there seem to have been very good reasons for refraining from giving a definition of these words. Another point is that uniform language is not employed in the trade mark legislation of the various States. In the New South Wales Act it is set forth that &#34; trade mark &#34; includes so and so; in the Trade Marks Act of another State no definition of the words is given, whilst in the legislation of still another State it is provided that &#39;&#39;trade mark&#34; means a trade mark registered under this Act. If we gave a limited definition of  the word we should not be sure of the extent to which we were covering or superseding the ground occupied by the various States laws, and therefore the only safe course is to stand by the words &#34; trade marks &#34; used in the Constitution. I think that these are fair and valid reasons for the position taken up by the Government. But there is something else to be said. 1 quite appreciate the view expressed by the honorable and learned member for Angas that we should endeavour to secure some certainty in our laws. But I hold that if we keep to the constitutional words we shall achieve that end. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member knows that the various States have shown  exactly  how -far thev have legislated on this  subject.  If we  say that we shall legislate to only a certain extent in regard to this question, our Act may not fit in with&#39; the States Acts. While it may more than cover some of them, it may not cover others, and cover still others &#39;only in parts. That being so, my view is that we should keep to the words used in the Constitution. We wish to cover the whole of the ground included by the use! of the words &#34;trade marks&#34; in the Constitution, but we could not, even if we desired, go beyond that. If we cover all trade marks, we cover all States Acts dealing with trade marks. Apart altogether from the difficulties I have pointed out, there is one other very important consideration. I am sure that the honorable and learned member for Angas does not wish to act unfairly ; but according to his. own showing the acceptance of his amendment would determine the question of the insertion of provisions relating to workers&#39; trade marks. It would not be fair to have that question decided until it had been properly discussed, and I hold that it cannot be so discussed at this stage. I, for one, could not properly deal with it on this clause. It is not my intention to discuss it until I can do so effectively, so that I shall bcf able to put clearly before the country the views of the Government. It would not be fair to the Committee or to the country to have on this clause, so to speak, a snatch vote upon that question. In any e\vent, it would not, in my opinion, decide the matter, and, therefore, the honorable and learned member&#39;s object would not be achieved. Apart from that question, however, it would be a mistake to insert an interpretation which could not widen, but might, on the other hand, shorten, the application of the Bill. If we do not simply adhere! to the use of the words &#34;trade marks,&#34; we may possibly fall short of the power given us by the Constitution, and thereby throw the States into confusion. I trust that that will not be done, but that we shall follow the course adopted by the last two Governments, both of which, for what I think are&#60; practical reasons, refrained from inserting in the Bill a definition of the words. </para>

          <para>- It is very difficult for a layman to follow the devious arguments of lawyers on a subject like this. I can speak on the amendment of &#34;the honorable and learned member for Angas only from the stand-point of an ordinary business man, and it seems to me that the measure should contain a distinct definition of a trade mark. The AttorneyGeneral takes up the position that any definition will reduce the possible applicability of the Bill to the conditions which may obtain in the various States, but that does not seem a satisfying reason why we should make no effort to determine what is henceforth to be understood by the term &#34; trade mark.&#34; The honorable and learned gentleman &#39;told us that, when the Committee came to deal with the union label provisions, he would take us into his confidence, and explain the whole position, and I hope that when he has made that explanation, he will give us an opportunity, in the event of the amendment not being carried, to come back to this clause, and insert in it a definition of a trade mark. I know that it is idle for any one who does not possess a legally-trained mind to go into the devious paths of trade marks legislation, but I hope that, in the interests of the commercial and trading community, the Committee will make the provisions of the Bill so clear that it will not be necessary to resort to the Courts for an interpretation of their meaning. Therefore I feel that we are justified in asking the AttorneyGeneral to determine wha&#39;t constitutes a trade mark. I think that the honorable and learned member for Angas has done well in asking the Committee to adopt the English definition, to which the AttorneyGeneral objects on the ground that it may limit the scope of the measure. What we desire is, not to pass the Bill merely to give effect to the trade union clauses which have caused so much obstruction, but to place on the statute-book a measure which will be of benefit to the whole community. Surely the Attorney-General, whose intellectual ability is unquestioned, will help us in doing &#39;that, and will place us in possession of the information which he can obtain from the capable officers of his Department. Many of us think that the honorable and learned gentleman would not urge the metaphysical objections to the amendment which we have heard if he had not ahead of him the troublesome trade union label provisions, and we think that, for the guidance of the general public, as well as of manufacturers and! merchants, he should, as Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, assist us to indicate clearly what constitutes a trade mark. </para>

          <para>- As I understand the honorable and learned member for Angas, the object of the amendment is to exclude the provisions of Part VII. from the scope of the Bill, but, having listened attentively to the speeches of the honorable and learned members for Northern Melbourne, Indi, and Werriwa, I have come to the conclusion that that object would not be achieved if the amendment were carried. The honorable and learned member for Angas interjected when the Attorney-General was speaking that section 62 of the English Act separates ownership of goods from ownership of a trade mark. It is proposed to practically embody that section in the Bill. I did not, however, follow the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in his statement that section 62, and subsequent sections, give power to register union labels. </para>

            <para>- It may be ; but I do not think that that section has a union label tinge upon it, which confirms me in the view that the object of the honorable and learned member for Angas would not be achieved, even if the amendment were carried. In any case, I think that this is not the proper place to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to the trade union label provisions. I agree with the AttorneyGeneral that, in view of present conditions, it would not be wise to define a trade mark here, seeing that, for some considerable time, we must carry on the Trade Marks Acts of the States. Clause 16, however, defines the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark, and if an effort is to be made to test the propriety of defining a trade mark, I think it should be made on that clause. </para>

The proper time to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to those provisions will be when we come to Part VII., whose consideration I am prepared to approach with an open mind. I suggest the withdrawal of the amendment. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Moira based his opposition to the amendment on the ground that an object in view, which he assumes is the whole object - the rendering invalid of the trade union label provisions - would not be achieved if it were agreed to; but the interjection of the honorable and learned member for Angas, I think, removes that objection. The honorable member thinks that this is not the stage at which to discuss the merits of the trade union label provisions, in which I agree with him, because, as the Attorney-General has pointed out, we cannot by definition limit any subsequent provisions of the Bill unless we delete the words &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended.&#34; I do not suppose honorable members wish to delete those words, and cause the Bill, perhaps, to be re-drafted; but if they are &#34;permitted to stand, no definition of a trade mark which we might- insert would necessarily affect the trade union label provisions. At the present time we are concerned only with whether we should or should not seek to define a term -which governs the whole measure. The measure is called a Trade Marks Bill, but there is nothing in it to indicate what a trade mark is. The Constitution gives us unlimited powers over trade marks, and the Attorney-General argues that we should, therefore, not attempt to limit those powers, but should exercise them to the full. I do not agree with the Attorney-General in his view that it is expedient to omit a definition of the trade marks with that end in view. When powers  aTe  conferred! upon us, we do not necessarily receive an injunction to use them to the fullest extent. We should exercise them just so far as we may consider it is expedient to do so. </para>

            <para>- At present we know the uses <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which trade marks can be put, and it is very easy for us to adopt a definition which would bring all the present users of trade marks within the scope of the Bill. .The Attorney-General told us, earlier in the debate, that each State had its own Trade Marks Act, and that the usages which have prevailed hitherto in the various States would be seriously interfered with if we limited our very wide powers over trade marks generally. I agree with him in his axiom, but not in his deduction. He assumes that we should interfere as little as possible with the trade mark users in the States, but surely we could make the definition wide enough to cover all the different usages in the States, and no more. If we adopt that plan, the holders of trade marks will know exactly where they stand, but if we omit .to define trade marks, we shall lead to endless litigation. Surely we should not render it necessary for persons to go before the Courts, in order to ascertain their true positions. The Attorney-General told us that any interpretation of the Constitution would necessarily involve immense litigation. </para>

            <para>- The best way in which we can do that is by adopting a definition of the term &#34;trade mark,&#34; wide enough in itself to embrace all the existing usages in the Commonwealth, and yet not so wide as to leave room for doubt as to our meaning. I do not see why the AttorneyGeneral should object to that course being adopted. I can understand the fear of the honorable members of the Labour Party that any limitation of our powers might prove fatal to the inclusion of the union label proposals ; but no such result could accrue from the adoption of the amendment. All we should have to do would be to adopt some wider definition of &#34;trade union label.&#34; I hope that the Attorney-General will see his way to accept the amendment, because it is our dutv to make our meaning plain, and to avoid giving rise to complaints that owing to the want of definiteness in our legislation, the public are put to considerable expense in bringing actions at law. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(Angas). - I should like to say a few words in reference to the remarks of the Attorney-General. He has argued that we should leave the Constitution to operate to the fullest extent of the powers given to us under it, and that if we adopted a definition, those powers might be limited. That argument would also apply to the .definition adopted in the English legislation. The Constitution Act is an Imperial Statute, and the words &#34; trade marks &#34; contained therein will be interpreted according to the signification attached to them in England at the time the Act was passed. In 1901, when the Constitution Act came into force, we had various States laws, all based upon English common law, with statutory modifications ; and if I remember aright, the New South Wales Act would exclude union labels, because trade marks could not be registered by any class, but must be registered by a &#34; person,&#34; which would include a company. Surely we ought to define what we mean, and not perpetuate the state of ambiguity which existed prior to the passing of the Trade Marks Act in England in 1905. It was in order to get rid of these ambiguities, and the somewhat conflicting decisions, that that Act was passed, and we should commit a great mistake if we failed to accept a definition which is a digest of the best of the English decisions. The draftsman .of the Bill before us may have omitted a definition of &#34; trade mark,&#34; because the Bill was first drafted in 1903, up to which time there was no English Registration Act that contained a definition of &#34;trade mark.&#34; We should certainly take advantage of the very deliberate judgment of experts as to what is a trade mark. If we include the proposed definition, the Bill will embrace everything covered by the English definition, and if union labels come within the scope of that definition, they will be trade marks. If union labels can be registered as trade marks by virtue of proprietorship, which mav exist in regard to certain classes of goods, we shall not require express clauses to bring them within the provisions of this Bill ; because, if they are true trade marks, they will come within the scope of the measure in any ease. If they are not true trade marks, we cannot include them within the scope of the measure by means of the provisions in Part VII. Apparently the object of these provisions is to give a bias by legislation to the definition of trade marks, and to express our opinion that when the Constitution Act came into force, the definition of trade marks covered union labels. My contention is that if under the law of 1901, union labels were not trade marks, our legislation cannot make them such. Not one clause in the &#39;Bill would legalize the use of union labels, unless they were true trade marks. I would remind the Committee that when I asked the Attorney-General whether this definiton was perfectly consistent with the union label clauses he hesitated to say that it was. My original point was that it would be inconsistent with those provisions. I am aware that in England very conflicting decisions have been given as to what is the real meaning of &#34; proprietorship &#34; and &#34;ownership &#34; in goods. But that some provision is necessary is as clear as daylight. That is evidenced by the fact that clause 22a, as framed by the Attorney-General, is practically a copy of section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905, which was introduced to meet the case of an expert who had been held to have no right of proprietorship in the case of certain goods. Owing to a doubt having arisen as to whether an expert who examined goods and certified as to their origin, mode of manufacture, and so forth - that is to say, whether they were hand-made or machine-made - had a right to a trade mark in respect of those goods, the law was declared in section 62 of the Imperial Act of 1905. </para>

          <para>In some cases it is difficult to decide what the precise meaning of a trade mark is ; for instance, where A has selected and imported goods made by B for many years, and has sold them under a particular trade mark. If A has been the sole importer, does the reputation of the mark refer to his selection and importation, or to B&#39;s manufacture? Such a question arose in <inline font-style="italic">Hirsch</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Jonas.</inline> There the plaintiff bought cigars of a foreign maker, who, at his request, placed a label bearing the words <inline font-style="italic">Gloria</inline><inline font-style="italic">de</inline><inline font-style="italic">Inglaterra Havannah,</inline> which had been designed and registered as his copyright by the plaintiff, upon the boxes. Subsequently the maker began to supply to the defendants for sale in the market similar cigars, not purchased by the plaintiff, but bearing the same label, and this the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought to restrain. The name of the plaintiff did not appear on the boxes, but that of the maker did. &#34; The trade mark of manufactured goods,&#34; said Jessel, M.R., &#34;means, X suppose, that the goods are manufactured by the person whose trade mark it purports to be. I can understand a man saying, &#39;I am not the actual manufacturer of goods, but the selector of goods, and my reputation for cleverness and selection is so great, that goods marked with a mark to show that they have been selected and approved of by me will fetch a higher price in the market.&#39; &#34; </para>

        <para class="block">The point at issue was : &#39; 1 Was such a man, seeing that he had not a direct ownership in the goods, entitled to register his mark under the Imperial Trade Marks Acts of 1883 and 1888 &#34; ?

But to set the matter beyond all doubt a section was introduced which, the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says, covers the question of the union label. </para>

            <para>- Probably. I have heard that even members of the Ministry held that the principle of the union label clauses is affirmed by section 62 of the Imperial Act, I say that that provision has nothing to do with that principle. If there were any doubt upon the point, why was it embodied in a separate part of the Act? The English provision is practically identical with clause 22 of this Bill.

            <para>- Their effect has been conveyed to me, but I do not know why the honorable and learned gentleman should hesitate to accept the amendment. It is far more desirable to have certainty in regard to our laws, than to make sure that we are going to the limits of our powers. I think that the definition is inconsistent with the union label clauses, and would probably exclude them; but the AttorneyGeneral has pointed out that it would apply only &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended.&#34; The honorable and learned gentleman has said that if we pass clauses authorizing the registration of union labels, we shall thereby show that it was otherwise clearly intended, and that consequently this definition will not prevent their inclusion in the Bill. Therefore, if his own argument be correct, he can have no fear in that regard. I presume that he cannot complain of being judged in this respect on his own words. The insertion of this amendment would furnish a reason for not introducing in the Bill what I regard as matters foreign to it. This definition appears in the English Act. </para>

            <para>- My impression is that I have seen it in one of the earlier Acts. That, however, may not be so. After many years&#39; experience, the Imperial Parliament, after dropping it for a time, has deliberately adopted a definition of &#34; trade mark.&#34; The purpose is to define as clearly as possible the object at which a measure is being directed. It seems to me that the desirableness of leaving out a definition which would have the great advantage of showing to some extent the boundary lines within which the Bill is to operate, should be justified by argument. The burden of proof does not rest upon those who wish to follow the English precedent, and if the Attorney-General&#39;s contentions have been correctly reported to me, it would appear that he has not correctly established that proof. On the one hand, if he says that this definition will not exclude the union label clauses, he can have no objection to it on that score. I assume that he is correct in his contention that it will not interfere with the union label clauses, which he has so much at heart, and which, at intervals, he has presented to us in a new dress, made in each case out of the old material. But, apart from that, it is desirable that we should follow the example set us by those who have had more experience than we have had. I do not suggest that they are better able than we are to form a judgment on the same material, but that they have &#39;merrie material than .we have upon which to come to a conclusion. I therefore regret to find the AttorneyGeneral taking up an attitude of unwillingness- </para>

            <para>- I repeat, that the AttorneyGeneral apparently desires to continue the differences between the various definitions of &#34;trade mark&#34; in the States Acts. It may be contended before the High Court that a certain device is a trade mark, according to the practice in one State; and the decision in that case will be imposed upon the rest of Australia. The question of whether a trade device is or is not a trade mark for Australia will thus depend upOn what used to be the law in the State in which the case arose. The  Attorney-General,  by refraining from inserting this definition, is insuring, a continuance of the divergences. In any case, rights under the Trade Marks Acts are preserved. </para>

            <para>- No. I hold that, unless we have a uniform view of what a trade mark is, we shall not secure uniformity in connexion with the registration of trade marks. If the Attorney-General&#39;s view is to prevail, the result will be that, because a &#187; device was a trade mark, say, in New South Wales, it must continue to be a trade mark in the Commonwealth, because, owing to a piece of good fortune, it happened to be registered in that State. But if it were not a trade mark according to the Western Australian view, the unfortunate man in that State would not secure that which was given to his brother in New South Wales. It is essential that we should have a definition, in order to show what devices are to be registrable. I know, however, that when the Attorney-General has made up his mind, after full consideration- </para>

Even if the late Government had considered this question, I am sure that it would have been prepared to listen to reason, and I trust that the present Administration, in the person of the Attorney-General, will take up the same position. I venture to say, with every respect, that the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s own reasons in opposition to the amendment are among the most substantial that could be given in support of it, and I hope that, in spite of his previous refusal, he will at the last moment accept if. </para>

He said that they were his goods, not in the sense of being his property, because a man might put his trade mark on goods worth thousands of pounds without having a penny of interest in them. </para>

            <para>- The distinction is a subtle, though, in my opinion, a real one. But I do not think that the explanation interferes -with my argument. The definition is intended to provide that the goods to which a trade mark is applied shall be the goods of the proprietor of such trade mark. </para>

            <para>- The definition, on the face of it, deals with ownership in connexion with manufacture. The effect of the ramifications of business transactions on that ownership is another and a distinct matter. I think the definition covers, and is intended to indicate, ownership in its broadest sense, whether ownership in the way of manufacture, or of purchase, or of dealing with or offering for sale. At some point there.must be ownership and proprietorship of the goods to which the trade mark applies. Therefore, I think that the union label provisions, which are quite foreign to the purpose of a Trade Marks Bill, should be dealt with in a separate measure. Moreover, since we are anxious to fall into line with the rest of the Empire in connexion with trade matters, and as it is part of the policy of this Government to assimilate our trade and commerce more and more with that of the rest of the Empire, to the exclusion of trade outside it, the nearer we can. assimilate our laws governing trade to the English laws, the better it will be. The broad point which I make is that the definition proposed by the honorable and learned member for Angas was adopted by the Imperial Parliament within the last six months. It must not be forgotten that they have very strong trade organizations in the old country. We were told the other night by the honorable member for Yarra that the union label is in use in Great Britain, and has had this and that good result, or, in other words, that it is operative. Yet there is no mention of it in the English&#39; Trade Marks Act, nor was any opportunity given for dealing with it when the Bill was passing through the House of Commons. I have not heard that the subject was raised then, although there is a good contingent of Labour members there who would have been likely to insist upon the matter being dealt with if they thought it proper to deal with it in such a measure. The fact that the sub ject was not raised is the clearest proof that they regard it as a matter which should not be dealt with in a Trade Marks Bill, but, if necessary, in a separate and distinct measure. I think that we cannot do better than follow Imperial precedent. The Attorney-General, in reply to the honorable and learned member for Corinella, said that if the definition were inserted it would be contended that it applied to the provisions of each of the Trade Marks Acts of the States. That might, perhaps., be so, if the definition clause did not commence with the words, &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I take it that it might be clearly intended to the contrary in any other part of the Bill. Personally I do not see that the adoption of the amendment would exclude the trade union provisions from the scope of the Bill, unless it can be argued that the words, &#34; except where otherwise clearly intended,&#34; imply a limitation, and cover only matters germane to the Bill, and relating to trade marks pure and&#39; simple. Looking at them broadly, they might cover anything that might be put into the Bill. Indeed, I am at a loss to understand why these words are used in every definition clause. I take it that it is not good drafting to use such a provision, though I admit that some very eminent draftsmen have used it. They do not, however, seem to use such words in the English legislation, where the  definni tions  are very precise, as all definitions should be. </para>

            <para>- The lawyers make their own work. If a number of lawyers are let loose on the simplest matter, they soon make it appear difficult and occult. There is this clear distinction, between English Statutes and ours - that in the English Acts the definitions are clear and definite. One of the unfortunate results of making our definition clauses so loose and vague is that anything mav be introduced into a Bill. In my opinion, however, an Act of Parliament should be very precise, not only in its definitions, but also in its text. One measure should not re-enact the provisions of another. In this Bill, however, there are a number of the provisions of the </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta apparently assumed that English legislation had confined the use df trade marks to those who owned the goods to which the mark was to be applied. If the honorable member had read the English Act, he would have noticed that it went a great deal further than that. The use of the words &#34; selection &#34; and &#34; certification &#34; in the amendment indicate that the English legislation goes much further than the honorable member would have us believe. There is a special section in the English law which permits trade marks to be applied to goods which are not the property of the owner of the trade mark, that is marks which certify to the quality or the standard of the goods to which they are applied.  There  are several kinds of marks specially mentioned in the English&#39; law which are beyond the ordinary definition of trade marks -if we are to accept the definition of the ownership of goods to which the mark is to be applied. If the honorable member will look at&#39; the English law,  he  will see that it goes a long way beyond the contention now put forward. Therefore, there does not seem to be any necessity to make the amendment. </para>

            <para>- The clause provides that under such circumstances the trade mark may be registered, subject to such conditions as the Registrar, Law Officer, or Court thinks fit to impose to preserve the rights of each proprietor. Let us assume that certain trade marks have been registered in one of the smaller States, and that a registration in respect of the same mark has taken place in one of the larger States. When the Commonwealth is called upon to decide as between these persons, it appears to me that the individual who has registered the trade mark in the larger State might be given priority. But if we are guided by considerations of equity, it is impossible to say which individual should register. </para>

            <para>- Of course, a trade mark is capable of registration year in and year out. Sooner or later we have to face this difficulty, &#34; Which trade mark shall prevail&#34;? The word &#34;Court&#34; as it is used in sub-clause 3 means the High Court or the Supreme Court of a State. To my mind that is a very large definition. It seems to me that cases such as I have alluded to ought to be decided only by the Supreme Court. </para>

          <para>- This clause, I take it, means that any State-registered proprietor of a trade mark may seek to come under this Bill, and so extend his  registra-tion  over the whole of the Commonwealth, but if a similar registration has been made by another individual in another State His extension shall except the area covered bv that registration. But what will happen if the Trade Marks Office is not aware of the other man&#39;s mark - if, for instance, B, in Western Australia, has not brought it under the notice of that office? In that case, A might get his trade mark registered for the whole of Australia, although B really has the registered right in Western Australia for a considerable number of years to come. </para>

            <para>- I am not sure that it does cover the case in question. This section purports to cover it, but I am not sure that when it specifically does so, a subsequent general clause may be invoked. I submit this point to the Attorney-General as a matter of immediate importance, and suggest to him that he will be able to recommit the clause if he thinks it necessary, to do so. At present, I think that it is desirable to insert either something showing that &#34;the general rectification provisions shall apply to the correcting of an error of the kind I have mentioned, or some special provision. It is a matter which will  require  much attention in connexion with the administration of the Act if trouble is to be avoided. The subclause provides that - </para>

Let me give an illustration of what I have in mind : Supposing that there was a trade mark, consisting of the letters &#34;X Y Z,&#34; registered in Victoria, in respect of knitting-needles, and that the same letters had been  registered  in Western Australia as a trade mark in respect of the same goods. Let us suppose, further, that the proprietor of the trade mark registered in Victoria got his mark extended oyer the Commonwealth, but that in the registration a limitation was made so that it should not apply to Western Australia. I take it that that would mean that the Victorian proprietor must not sell his goods under that mark in Western Australia. Does the AttorneyGeneral think it desirable that in such a case the proprietor should be called upon to add to the fetters <inline font-style="italic">&#34; X</inline> Y Z &#34; such words as &#34;Not for Western Australia&#34; ? </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that this is the fault of the draftsman. It is clear that we could not provide, in the circumstances I have named, that the man who first attempted to register such a mark in respect of the whole Commonwealth should have a prior right. I think a time limit should be imposed within which it would be assumed that all applications had been made. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to determine that the man who had registered first, in point of time, under the State law, should be entitled to priority of registration in respect of the other States. That would be a rough and ready way of determining, the matter, but certainly not more so than is the present system. I think that in the general run of affairs, practical justice will be meted out by allowing the man who has first registered under any State Act priority in other States. </para>

            <para>- Such cases would be found more numerous than many of us imagine. Cases have been brought under my notice in which a trade mark registered by one person in one State has been registered by another person in a different State; but we have not yet attempted to deal with that phase of the question. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to put a supposititious case to the Committee. Let us suppose that A has registered a star as a trade mark for particular goods in one State, and that B has an identical mark registered in another State, in respect of the same goods. If those men were both trading in the other States of the Commonwealth, I do not think that either would have an exclusive right to the use of that mark. </para>

            <para>- That neither could stop the other from using the mark. Subclause s, as we propose to amend it, will provide for cases of that kind. Let us suppose that one man in New South Wales and another in Victoria had registered a star as a trade mark, and that both were trading over the rest of the Commonwealth. In that case, neither could oust the other, so far as the use of that mark was concerned from the other States, because its use would be common to both. But if one of them were trading alone in the other States, he would be the person who could secure registration. </para>

          <para>- Clause 8 allows the registered proprietor of a trade mark properly registered under the Trade Marks Act of a State to apply for registration under the Bill ; but a difficulty is created by the fact that in many cases the same trade mark has been registered bv different persons in different States. The Attorney-General has taken some pains to protect the rights of such persons, though he seems to think that such cases are not common. My own, experience tells me - and I have probably had as much experience in this matter as any member of the Committee - that they are common. I happen to know that a star - to take the illustration of which he made use - has been registered as a trade mark in several of the States. The question therefore arises, how are the rights of manufacturers in different States who have registered the same trade mark to be determined when application is made for a Commonwealth trade mark? Let me take a set of facts which are within my own knowledge. A was manufacturing in four States under several trade marks, all of which were registered in each of those States.  His  business was disposed of separately, B buying the New South Wales business, C the Victorian business, D the South Australian business, and E the Tasmanian business. The purchasers in two at least of the four States are trading with the remaining two States, Queensland and Western Australia, and have a common user of the trade marks in those States. It seems to me that it will be difficult to determine their rights when they apply for a Commonwealth registration. The Bill appears to protect their rights so far as the States in which&#39; they are manufacturing, and in which their trade marks are now registered, are concerned. But suppose they apply for a Federal registration to cover the States of Queensland and Western Australia, what will their position be? </para>

            <para>- If the AttorneyGeneral could show us that, although such registered proprietors of trade marks will not be able to obtain registration for States in which they are not now registered, other parties will not be allowed to infringe their present rights, my opposition to the clause will vanish. </para>

        <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline> (Indi- Attorney-General). - I do not appreciate the difficulty. It seems 1x&#62; me that registered proprietors under States Acts will have the same protection under the Bill as they have now. Each will have an exclusive right to the use of his trade mark in the State in which it is registered, and where, as at the present time, they are trading on common ground in another State, they will be able to prevent any one else from fraudulently imitating their trade mark, and passing off his goods as goods of their manufacture. At the present time any one else would be prevented by the Courts from doing so. The honorable member must not confuse infringement of a trade mark with passing off goods as another&#39;s manufacture. If A and B are registered in New South Wales and Victoria respectively, and are trading in Western Australia, they cannot now, and could not under the Bill, register their trade mark in Western Australia; but after the Bill is passed they will continue to enjoy their present rights, no more and no less. The whole difficulty lies in determining who shall have the right to register in a State in which no one has yet been trading ; but such cases will be very rare. </para>

          <para>- The clause provides that the proprietor of a trade mark properly registered under the Trade Marks Act of a State may apply for the registration qf his trade mark under the Bill, and I understand that, if his application is granted, the registration will apply to the whole of Australia. But a person in New South Wales, and another in Victoria, might both have registered the same trade mark under the Trade Marks Acts of their respective States. If one of them applied for a Commonwealth registration, the other, knowing nothing of the application&#39;, would he be given the exclusive right to use the trade mark throughout Australia, preventing the other from using it, first, in the State in which he was originally registered, and, secondly, in the remaining States? </para>

        <para class="block">That may mean a great deal, or it may mean very little How will the Registrar deal with the claims of two persons hav-  ing a registered trade mark in Victoria and New South Wales respectively, as to States in which they may have a common right of user? How will their claims to the use of the trade mark be protected against outsiders? If the Registrar had power to say that A and B having registered trade marks in Victoria and New South Wales respectively, .should have exclusive rights in those two States, but only rights in common in other cases, they would be protected against outsiders, but if there is to be a mere scramble for the right to register, some of those who have been using certain trade marks in common will suffer wrong. The -Attorney-General says that they will occupy the same position as at present, but that is not satisfactory. Unless those who have registered trade marks in, say, Victoria and New South Wales, are allowed to acquire rights in common in other States, it will be open to any merchant to deprive a Victorian manufacturer of the right to use a certain trade mark beyond that State. </para>

            <para>- But will any provision be made for the protection of those who have rights in common in certain States? I admit that such persons have no legal status at present, but as a matter of fact a number of manufacturers have common rights of user in regard to  certain  trade marks in States outside those in which they are the registered proprietors of such marks. I should think it would be possible to provide that, say, A and B could become the joint proprietors of a certain trade mark in States in which they had exercised certain rights of user. I think we should lay down some definite principle at law, in order to prevent litigation as much as possible. </para>

It is intended to preserve intact every right that is now possessed under the States laws. The man who registers a star, say, in New South Wales, as a trade mark, is to keep it exclusively, and a man who has made a similar registration in Victoria is also to have the exclusive right to its use in that State. If there be any other State in which the trade mark has not been used, the person who has registered it in ohe State will have the right to extend his registration, but if other persons have been using it he is not to have the exclusive right to it. The Registrar will first of all determine on the facts whether or not any one else has been using the trade mark. If it has been used in common, no exclusive right can be granted. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline>B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - I think that the difficulty to which&#39; reference has been made could be better met in the interpretation clause The AttorneyGeneral might fairly promise to consider the particular points alluded to by recommitting that clause, with a view to laying down a definition of &#34; registered proprietor.&#34; Under this Bill rights are given to registered proprietors to make application to the Registrar to get the registration of  a  trade mark altered. The term &#34; registered proprietor &#34; may have two meanings. The simplest meaning that could be attached toit would be that of a registered proprietor under this Bill. He would not be the individual who would most probably figure as= an objector to a registration under this measure. I think that the Attorney-General, if&#34; he sees good ground for so doing, should, after we have discussed subsequent clauses, recommit the interpretation clause, with aview to inserting a definition of &#34;registered&#39; proprietor,&#34; which would include not only <inline font-style="italic">st</inline> registered proprietor under this Bill, but  also a registered proprietor under a State Act. </para>

Honorable members will notice that as soon as a person registers under this Bill the registration of his trade mark under a State Act ceases. It seems to me that we should protect existing rights. In the interests of those who have registered under State Acts, it appears to me that an office should be provided in each State, at which they can register under this Bill. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. A man must not lead the public to believe, by the use of a mark, whether registered or &#39;unregistered, that his goods are those produced by some one else. But the point is that we are going to allow unregistered marks to be registered, although they do not comply with the provisions of this measure - we are going to allow them to be registered merely because they have been used. I suggest to the Attorney-General that those who have been content with their user and have not registered! should be allowed &#34;to rely on their user. They should not be permitted to register under this Bill a mark which, but for their user, thev would not be allowed to register. Let them register - now, if they wish to, but hereafter let the Commonwealth law .apply, so far as any unregistered mark is concerned. I fail to </para>

            <para>- I doubt whether his right to register ought to be saved. It is all very well to give every protection to registered marks, and to provide for transfer from the State register to the Federal register with such limitations as may be necessary. But why should the Federal register be loaded up with marks which, &#34;from the point of view of the Federal law, do not contain the necessary essentials? I do not propose to move an amendment, but point out that in sub-clause 4 we have limitations as to mode, place, or period of uSer. Why, I do not know, seeing that the question of a mark being in use in other States does not arise under that provision. </para>

            <para>- We might provide that where a trade mark is registered, it shall not confer exclusive rights as against the unregistered proprietor, but my point is that it is unnecessary to cumber the register with another variety of mark, instead of endeavouring to secure uniformity. It seems to me that it is proposed to give to the unregistered proprietor more consideration than he is entitled! to receive. As long as- he is protected by his user in his own State, that is all that he should expect. If he wishes to register under this law he ought to so adapt his trade mark as to make it registrable. </para>

          <para>. - I take it that the point that we should keep in mind is that we are not going to take away rights which now exist, and that we do not intend to have new registrations placed on the States registers. If we combine both those considerations, we shall recognise that we must adopt such a clause as this. A man may be carrying on business in, say, Tasmania, and be using a mark that he has not troubled to register. Registration is only a matter of evidence and of record. Tt does not give the registrar of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> mark a right ; it only evidences the </para>

        <para>Where the same trade mark or a nearly identical trade mark is owned or registered by another proprietor in any part of the Commonwealth in respect of the same goods, the trade mark may be registered, subject to such conditions and limitations as to mode or place of user or otherwise as the Registrar, Law Officer, or Court thinks fit to impose to preserve the rights of each proprietor. </para>
        <para>This will carry out the same principle with regard to unregistered marks as we have . just observed with regard to registered marks.  If we struck out this clause, the owner of an unregistered mark would have no power to secure its registration. As the States Acts would be inoperative, he would be in the unfortunate position of having a trade mark which he could mot register. Then, again, he might not be able to register under this Bill, because his mark might not answer to the description of a trade mark registrable under it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ISAACS</inline>(Indi- Attorney-General). - This clause is to allow the unregistered proprietor of a mark in a State to register under this Bill. We propose, by subclause 4A,  to provide that if the same trade mark, or a nearly identical mark, is owned or registered by another proprietor in any part of the Commonwealth in respect of the same goods, the rights of both shall be preserved. Sub-clause 5 provides that where a trade mark, or a nearly identical trade mark is common to the trade in another State, it may be registered with an . exception as to that State Registration is to give no exclusive right as to that </para>
        <para>State. But the new sub-clause deals with a case in which another man in another State has an exclusive right to a mark, and provides that the registration of the first applicant is to be subject to that exclusive right. </para>

            <para>- The Crown Solicitor could administer the measure if he were empowered to do so; but if a responsible Minister is deemed* necessary, I do not think that the task should be given to the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has already almost more work to do than any of his colleagues. Besides, the administration of this measure would raise highly technical questions, very different from those which are raised in connexion with the ordinary business of the Department of Trade and Customs, and, therefore, the measure, if it must be allotted to any one Minister, should be given to the Attorney-General. I think, however, that it would be better to leave it to each Administration to say what Minister should administer the measure. </para>

            <para>- I think that the Patents Office would be better administered by the Attorney-General than by the Minister of Trade and Customs, because of the highly technical questions involved in its administration - questions very different from those arising in connexion with the importation or exportation of goods. It is. however, common in many of the States to allow Administrations to determine what Ministers shall administer particular Acts, and I would leave this measure to be dealt with in that way. Why should a layman like the present Minister of Trade and Customs be preferred for the administration of this measure to lawyers like the AttorneyGeneral or the Minister of Home Affairs ? </para>

          <para>- It seems to me that this measure, if any, should be administered by a man of legal training; and in Victoria it has been thought advisable not only to leave the administration- of the Trade Marks and Patents Acts to the Attorney-General, but to appoint as the permanent head of the Department an officer who has received a legal training. When the Federal Patent Office was established, a number of Patent Attorneys urged that the Commissioner should possess legal qualifications, because the questions that would come before him would require the application of a skilled legal mind. That course was not followed; and, although the present Commissioner is a capable and obliging officer, his want of technical legal knowledge is a great drawback. The Registrar of Trade Marks should certainly be a highly qualified lawyer. It is not sufficient that difficult points should be referred to the AttorneyGeneral. The natural tendency of officials is not to refer any but the most difficult matters to the law adviser of the Government, and it becomes the practice of individuals possessing no legal training to settle technical matters for themselves, and very frequently provoke litigation. We should follow in the footsteps of Victoria, and place the Trade Marks Office under the administrative guidance of the Attorney-General. I make no reflections upon the present Minister of </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Trade and Customs, or his predecessors; but I contend that the Trade Marks Bill should be administered by the AttorneyGeneral, because many questions of an exceedingly technical character will have to be decided. This matter may seem of very small importance to laymen, but those who have any dealings with the office will find that it is in the highest degree desirable to have a lawyer at the head of affairs. </para>

            <para>- No*; that would be unreasonable. The cases arising in the Patents and Trade Marks Offices will, for the most part, involve questions of law ; whereas any man of reasonable intelligence, and of an inquiring mind, could settle for himself most of the matters of fact which have to be dealt with in the administration of the Customs Department. </para>

            <para>- Yes. Very many cases of that kind have to be dealt with ; but I think it would be very improper for the AttorneyGeneral, knowing that there might be an appeal to him, to interfere in the administration before the appeal was made. If the Registrar happened to come to him for any directions he would refuse to give them. It would be improper to first give directions to the Registrar, who ought to decide matters for himself, and to afterwards Hear an appeal from his decision. Therefore, I do not think that anything would be gained by placing the Trade Marks Office under the administration of the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

            <para>- It has its good, as well as it&#39;s bad points. Amongst other things, it offers  a  cheap and ready means of appeal. At present, patent attorneys can appear before the Attorney-General and represent their clients in  appeal  cases at much less cost than  if  thev had to employ solicitors and counsel to plead before the High Court or the Supreme Court. Although the present system may involve a duplication of appeals in cases where parties are not satisfied with the decision of the law officer, there are many advantages to be urged in its favour. </para>

            <para>- I have looked into the matter, and so far as I can judge, the balance of convenience lies in the direction of allowing an intermediate appeal, and if an intermediate appeal lies, it will be  wrong  to introduce the Attorney-General as  Dart  administrator in cases which he would, afterwards have to decide on appeal, Clause 718s. which provides against the importa  tion into  Australia of goods with false trade marks; clause  78T,  which relates to aiding and abetting offences; and clause 78u, which prohibits the importation, of fraudulently marked goods, will have to be administered by Customs officials ; arid it would be impossible for the AttorneyGeneral to carry out the purposes of the Bill unless he had such officers under his control. In view of the fact that the Patents Office is already administered by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and that the Trade Marks branch would be properly conjoined to it, I see no reason for departing from the scheme laid down in the Bill. It is all very well to say that we might pass a short Act, authorizing the transfer of the Patents Offide tto the Attorney-General&#39;s Department,: but I should like to ascertain the views of the Patents officials before I acquiesced in a proposal of that kind. Certainly, unless the Patents Office were transferred to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, double expense would be incurred by placing the Trade Marks branch under his administration. The AttorneyGeneral is always available to advise the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has his own officers to look after matters of detail. It would not be right for the Registrar to ask the Attorney-General how he should decide in a particular case; and if that were not done there would be no need for the Attorney-General, or any other Minister, to pay attention to the affairs of the office, so long as the Minister of Trade and Customs was willing to exercise his supervision. </para>

He says that the Attorney-General is always available to advise the Minister - or, in other words, that the Registrar may go to the Minister, and that the Minister may then seek the advice of the Attorney-General. </para>

            <para>- Because in Australia a great deal is left to the Minister for the time being, whereas in England a totally different system has grown up - a system under which the Under-Secretaries practically exercise full control over everything relating to their Departments. At present the Minister of Trade and Customs has sufficient time at his disposal to enable him to deal, not only with patents, but with trade marks. But, as the years pass, he may not have time to attend to those matters. Moreover, the creation of fresh Departments may render the appointment of additional Ministers necessary, and therefore, it is very desirable that the Attorney-General should have power to deal with this matter without the necessity of passing a special Act of Parliament. If we look ahead halfadozen years, the suggestion which has been made must be regarded as a wise one. My point is that we should not take away from the Executive for the time being, the power to say to which of their members they shall delegate the administration of certain Acts. </para>

The honorable and learned member for Werriwa must know that there are many reasons why officers in the various States are frequently removed from the control of one Minister to that of another.

          <para>- The AttorneyGeneral, by interjection, has referred to the probability of our having in each State a sub-office of the Department of Trade Marks. I do not see any provision in the Bill to provide for that. Clause 11 sets forth that the Commissioner of Patents shall be the Registrar of Trade Marks, and authorizes the appointment of a  deputy  registrar. Then clause 12 provides for the establishment of the Trade Marks Office. Turning to clause 4, Ave see that reference is made to &#34; the &#39; &#39; Trade Marks Office, and to &#34;the &#34; State in which the Trade Marks Office is situate. It would thus appear that provision is made for only one office. I draw the attention of the AttorneyGeneral to this point, in order that he may make the amendments necessary to carry out the purpose which he indicated. </para>

          <para>. - It is true that I made the interjection to which the honorable and learned member has referred, and I think that it would be only proper to have in each State an office where applications to register trade marks could be lodged. But I see great difficulty in providing a staff of officers in each State to deal with these matter!* There must be a central office for that purpose, but there ought to be an office in each State where applications might be lodged. Applicants may consider it desirable to send in their applications to the head office.  In my opinion, that would be the more expeditious and secure course to adopt. </para>

          <para>- I trust that the Committee will not insist upon any duplication of machinery in relation to this measure. It has been stated by at least some honorable members that the machinery necessary for the administration of this Bill can be provided almost entirely by the present officers in the Patents branch. To begin by appointing a lawyer as Registrar of Trade Marks, and also appointing a deputy registrar in each State, would be to bring about such a duplication of machinery as would cause the taxpayer no little alarm. I trust that the AttorneyGeneral will give the matter very serious consideration before he agrees to such a duplication. </para>

            <para>- That is where the construction of an Act is faulty. But where the provisions of a measure are clear, a man of common sense can interpret them. Lawyers are trained to read sense into provisions which often, as they stand, are mere  nonsense. If a legal man were put at the head of this office, he would not give many opportunities for appeal. </para>

            <para>- In administering a measure of this kind, a man would always have to be guided by previous decisions. Of course, trouble occurs when one is asked to construe an Act of Parliament the meaning of which is obscure. In such a case, a man finds it difficult to make up his mind, because Parliament did not express its mind. The lawyers ought to be thankful to the honorable member for Bland for saying that he does not want a man with legal training at the head of this Department. </para>

          <para>, - The bookkeeping system to which the honorable member refers is not the bookkeeping system provided for in the Constitution. The expense of collecting these fees will practically be nothing. The provision is similar to that in the Patents Act. When the Bill comes into force, the Trade Marks Acts of the States will be administered by the Commonwealth. Those Acts will have force for a period not exceeding fourteen years, in order to preserve existing rights. There may be fees payable in respect of pending proceedings, or to give effect to existing rights, though I do not suppose that they will amount to much, and the Commonwealth will collect them for the States. With regard to the commencement of the Act, honorable members will recollect that we amended clause 2 in order to provide that the Act shall commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation, not less than six months after its passing; but I understand from the Minister of Trade and Customs that the Department can be organized very much sooner than that, so that we may have to recommit the clause, in order to shorten the period provided for. </para>

If you were permitted to call a shoe a &#34; Danube &#34; shoe because no shoes were manufactured there, you would have to discontinue that description as soon as shoes were made there.

          <para>. -There is a prohibition in existence against the use of a geographical name as a trade mark, for the reason that no one has the right to appropriate a name or word that belongs to what one learned Judge called &#34; the great common of the English language.&#34; It would not be fair, for example, to grant an exclusive proprietary right to the use of the word &#34; Melbourne,&#34; as applied to soap made in that city. Some words that are geographical names may be used in certain collocations, because they do not convey a geographical signification. I think it was Lord Justice Fry who said that &#34; Monkey soap &#34; was a good term for a trade mark, because although there was such a place as Monkey Island, there could be no confusion between the trade article and the geographical name. In another case, a certain whisky was branded &#34; Magnolia,&#34; and as there was a town of that name in the United States, it was actually argued that that name could not be used. I must say that I prefer the language in the Bill, because I think it  is  more easily understood than that adopted in the English Act. It is verv difficult to say what is the ordinary signification pf a geographical name. I think that the true test is whether a name used in connexion with goods is likely to be understood in a geographical sense. </para>

        <para>After providing for the particulars essential to an application to register a trade  mark, the English section ends up by referring to &#34;any other distinctive mark.&#34; That is an indication that the earlier marks which are specifically mentioned are also distinctive marks. The word &#34;distinctive&#34; is defined in the English Act in the terms I have adopted, which indicate that the mark must be connected with the proprietorship of the goods - as I contended when we were dealing with the definition, of &#34;trade mark.&#34; I suggest that the words proposed be inserted, because they will certainly assist to keep our legislation in accord with that of Great Britain. As this clause is not applicable to union labels, it appears to me that there can be no objection to inserting the words proposed. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GLYNN</inline>(Angas).- The English Act clearly limits the definition to the proprietorship of goods. There is no doubt that the clause as drafted widens the scope of the Bill. As the Bill is drafted, it might possibly include trade union labels, but if the definition were embodied in the measure, trade union labels could not be included in its scope. The Attorney-General has referred to the distinction between proprietorship and ownership. The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moulton&#39;s</inline> remarks was that a man might be a proprietor so far as proprietorship is understood in connexion with ownership of the trade mark without being the actual owner of the goods. In the sense of the trade marks law the proprietor of any goods by virtue of their manufacture - although he might have parted with their actual ownership by selling to a retailer - would still retain the trade mark. However, I do not wish to press the amendment if it is not acceptable to the Attorney-General. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>(Corinella). - I wish to draw attention  to a fact in connexion with one or two subsequent clauses, which, at first sight, appears to evidence some inconsistency in drafting. Although the word &#34; distinctive &#34; is used only twice in clause 16, in clauses 21 and 22, which are taken from the roo4 Bill of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fletcher</inline> Moulton, the word &#34;distinctive-&#34; is used in a. much more general way. I venture to say that in those provisions the use of that word is not intended to be limited to the two cases mentioned in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause j 6, but is intended! to be used in connexion with a trade mark containing any of the essential particulars which are there enumerated. To mv mind, it evidences an omission in draftsmanship that, while clause 16 has been altered so that the word &#34; distinctive&#34; does not cover the whole provision as it does in the English Act, clauses 21 and 22 imply that that is intended. </para>

            <para>- I contend that the words, &#34;any other distinctive mark,&#34; which are contained in sub-section 5 of the English Act, necessarily imply that sub-sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 are also &#34; distinctive.&#34; Clauses 21 and 22 of this Bill do not control the determination of anything in clause 16, except, perhaps, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> and certainly paragraph c, whereas they ought to control them all. A trade mark which is not distinctive ought not to be registered as such. I am not prepared to suggest the exact verbiage of an amendment at the present moment, but I think there is reason for first giving a meaning to the word &#34; distinctive,&#34; in clause 16, and then for inserting some words which will make it apply to all the subsequent paragraphs of that provision. Under the Bill in its present form, clauses 21 and 22 would apply to some trade marks, and not to others - a curious distinction which does not exist in the English Act, and which does not arise specifically under some of the States Acts. Will the Attorney-General explain what is the meaning of the word &#34; other &#34; in subsection5 of the English Act. </para>

But it strikes me that the name of a company, individual, or firm represented in a particular manner must necessarily be distinctive. So with subsections 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are necessarily distinctive. The Act then provides for &#34;any other distinctive mark,&#34; with certain exceptions. It makes provision for old marks if they are special or distinctive. The meaning of the word &#34; distinctive &#34; is defined. The same mode of argument is applicable to this Bill. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b, d,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> are necessarily distinctive. Then we may devise as essential particulars of a registrable trade mark a device, mark, brand, heading; label or ticket, so long as. it is distinctive.

          <para>. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has drawn my attention to the words &#34;entered at Stationers&#39; Hall,&#34; which appear in this clause, and which, in his opinion, have no significance in Australia, and are, therefore, unnecessary. I do not know whether they are likely to be used under any Trade Marks Act. If they are not, I shall be willing to strike them out. I shall be glad to have the assistance of honorable members on this point. If they think that such words might be registered-- </para>

          <para>- I should like to learn from the AttorneyGeneral whether it would be right to invalidate a trade mark when it contained something else beside the devices prohibited by this clause. Suppose, for instance, that a trade mark had for its centre-piece the lion and the unicorn, or the arms of the Commonwealth, why should it not be possible for the applicant to omit those parts of the design, and to secure registration of the remainder? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).We have in this clause a very proper prohibition of any offence against morality - a prohibition which should, and no doubt does, find a place in every Trade Marks Bill. But I wish to know why this prohibition is not to apply to all labels and marks dealt with in the Bill. For instance, this provision is not to apply to the union label clauses. That, I presume, is an oversight. </para>

          <para>- In view  of  the amendments we have just made, does the Attorney-General think it desirable  to  omit these words? Surely the fact that three several persons had been honestly using a trade mark in any one State would be accepted by any Court as sufficient evidence as to common user ? That is the very evidence that would be offered in support of a claim that the trade mark was common to the trade, and it would be regarded as sufficient without any statutory authority. </para>

          <para>- Is it intended that the common use of a- trade mark in any one State shall preclude any person from obtaining exclusive rights to use it in any other part of the Commonwealth? Surely it is not right that a trade mark shall become common throughout the Commonwealth because it has been in common use in any one State? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCAY</inline>(Corinella).- The fact that a trade mark has been used by three persons in any one State would be stronger evidence of common user than if it had been used by three several persons in three several States, and therefore the clause should stand. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that no Court shouldbe empowered to order the registration of a trade mark identical with one already on the register. I could appreciate the advantage of a prohibition attaching to the registration of a trade mark so nearly resembling one already registered as to be likely to deceive, but I do not see why we should go any further. </para>

          <para>- This clause appears to afford no protection to the users of State registered trade marks. Under the law of a State, it may be possible for a man or firm to register a trade mark which contains some representation of a living being. But under this provision the Registrar will be compelled to ask the holder of any such trade mark to show his authority for using that representation. I do not suggest for a moment that it should be possible to place the portrait of a man upon a trade mark without his permission; but if people already enjoy that right under the law of any State, we should be very chary about interfering with them. </para>

          <para>. - Clause16 provides that the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark shall not be a geographical name used, or likely to be understood, in a geographical sense, but clause 17 provides that additional matter, consisting of any letters, words, or figures, or combinations of them, may be used. Clause 31 deals with trade marks which resemble each other in essential particular but differ in respect to statements of number, quality, price, and names of places. For instance, a manufacturer may use as a trade mark a label on which is printed in red an elephant, and under it the word &#34;London,&#34; while he may usea similar mark, substituting the word &#34; Manchester &#34; for the word &#34; London, &#39; &#39; and a third mark, substituting the words &#34; New York &#34; for the word &#34; Manchester,&#34; to indicate grades or qualities. </para>

          <para>- We have already provided that if a trade mark has been used honestly and publicly by more than three persons in any one State that fact shall be treated as conclusive evidence that it is common to the trade. Suppose, for example, that a trade mark for &#34; Skylark &#34; tea has been registered in Victoria and New South Wales, but not in Western Australia, and that some persons in the latter State, knowing of the popularity of the tea, use the trade mark, and make it common. I presume that under the provision we have already made it will be impossible for that trade mark to be registered in any State except those in which proprietary rights have already been acquired. It appears to me that the Registrar will have to inquire not only into the questions referred to in the amendment, but also as to whether the trade mark has been rendered common to the whole Commonwealth by user. </para>

          <para>- I  think that the Attorney-General might consider the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Corinella with regard to doing away with &#34; the right of appeal to the law officer, with a view to providing some easier and cheaper method of appealing to the Courts direct. </para>

            <para>- I would point out that in clause 34 it is provided that &#34; any party aggrieved by the decision of the law officer &#34; may appeal to the Court. That seems to imply that there are parties other than the applicant, and that will need to be altered if these clauses are intended to refer merely to unopposed applications. </para>
