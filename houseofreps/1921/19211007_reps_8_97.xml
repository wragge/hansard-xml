          <para>.- I am opposed to reducing the number of days of meeting in each week. In no period of the life of this Parliament has there been so much work to be done of grave importance to the community. Honorable members have only to inspect the business-paper to see that that statement is borne out. The delay in the settlement of the Tariff is holding up the business people of Australia. Some of the requests for its amendment submitted from another place, which it was never intended should make ducks and drakes of a Tariff, are of a very debatable character. Huge expenditures of public money are proposed, and require careful consideration. It would be better in the interests of honorable members to transact the business between now and Christmas than to. have to meet in the hotter portion of the year - from Christmas time until March. </para>

          <para>.- I think that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister is a reasonable one, and I hope it will be agreed to. It will be quite sufficient for us to meet three days in each week. If, as the right honorable gentleman has said, we find in a month&#39;s time that it will be impossible for us to complete our work within a reasonable period unless we meet oftener, we can then consider the advisability of having an extra sitting day. </para>

          <para>.- I offer no objection to the motion, but I should like to reiterate remarks which I have made on previous occasions when I have urged that, in the interests of honorable members coming from fardistant States, some special effort should be made to get through the business of this Parliament more rapidly than has been done in the past. It is very raTely that it is possible for me to get across to the State from which I come, and more rarely still to spend more than a week there. Another matter of great importance is, that when Parliament is continuously sitting it is quite impossible for Ministers to keep in touch with their Departments as they require to do. I hope that in future some change will be made to prevent such continuous sittings of Parliament as we have had in the past </para>

            <para>- It is quite true that a demand has been made by the State Government ofWestern Australia&#39; upon a Federal officer to give evidence and produce documents. I hope the honorable member will see that no State authority may take charge of our officers in that way, any more than we may take charge of State officers in any waywe choose. There is a proper way in which to deal with matters of this kind.. So far as the Federal Government are concerned, I should like to say that we have nothing whatever in view but the fullest possible investigation of every case of fraud that may have been perpetrated. &#34;We have been fighting the persons responsible for these things right along iu the interests of the soldier, and to protect his bond. Ever since we began to issue gratuity bonds, our trouble has been to prevent them getting into the hands of men who take advantage of the soldier. We have done our best in the matter. It may be that in some cases we have failed, but it has not been through any lack of intention to. protect the interests of the soldier. I hope that within a day or two we shall be able to clear up the matter to which the honorable member has referred, but we cannot do it at the demand of  a  State authority. It must be done of our own free will. </para>

            <para>- It is very difficult to answer in detail such a question on the spur of the moment. When the engineers met prior to the making pf this agreement many years ago, they estimated what would be the quantity of water available under this scheme, and they were then dependent upon the State Departments to supply information as to the irrigable acreage available. The information showed that the&#39; area of land available would be very much in excess of the water that could be provided under the agreement itself; but since those figures were received the estimates of the area of land suitable for irrigation have been revised considerably, and I have not yet received definite figures from the States. I promise to communicate with the State authorities in order to obtain from them precise information on this point. The honorable member will realize that the Commission has no control over the irrigation areas or settlers. Its functions relate simply to the execution of the works under the agreement, which are to provide the water for irrigation and navigation. I have certain figures as to the area of the irrigable land, but I do not care to give them, because they cannot be regarded as final. I will, however, obtain the information which the honorable member seeks. </para>

            <para>- Has  the  Assistant Minister for Repatriation read press reports to the effect that the Queensland Treasurer and Minister of Lands have been endeavouring, without avail, ever since 20th July last, to obtain a reimbursement from the Government on certificates of expenditure in connexion with soldier settlement in that State? The arrears are said to amount to over &#163;300,000. Is that statement accurate, and, if so, will the Minister take steps to see that redress is granted at once ? </para>

            <para>- -The honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cameron),</inline> brought that matter , under my notice this morning. I have not been dealing with the land settlement of soldiers since 30th June last, up to which date every certified claim had been recouped. However, at tha instance of the honorable member for Brisbane, I have obtained the following information from the Repatriation  Department : - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Queensland undertook to settle 2,826 men for &#163;2,831,914. Up to date it has settled 2,145 soldiers, and has received &#163;2,079,451. </para>
          <para class="block">That is in excess of the recoupments agreed upon pear soldier settler. Therefore the statement which- the honorable member for Wide Bay has quoted is not correct. On the other hand, some questions are in dispute between the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government. For instance, the State authorities ask us to accept financial responsibility for soldiers settled in that State prior to the agreement made with us. And there is also a dispute on the subject of prickly-pear land. However, to date the Queensland Government has had per soldier more than the amount agreed upon. </para>

It is understood that the measure will be passed towards the end of this year, and that the Convention will be elected early in 1922.

            <para>- I certainly will. In making arrangements for my visit to, England, and in fixing the date of &#39;my return, I had in view all the points which the honorable member has mentioned; and in my view it would be impossible to get the Bill through this Parliament unless it were introduced at a time approximating to the date fixed fer my return. The policy of the Government has all along been shaped towards that end which the honorable member declares to be the desire of the people; but two problems of importance cannot occupy the attention of the House and the public at the same time. We have been discussing matters of very great importance this week. Next week we shall probably be discussing matters of equally great importance. We have no idea at present what they may be, but no doubt that is what we shall be doing. And then in the week after we shall be dealing with a subject to which my attention has already been drawn. Shipbuilding, the Estimates, and the Budget debate are questions ahead of us for discussion ; and we are only human beings. However, Ministers are quite ready, and it only remains to clear away all these other matters of vital importance, and which cannot be ignored, in order to enable the necessary Bill to be introduced. </para>

              <para>- That could be done, but my experience of adopting that course has been such that it does not commend itself to me. Unless a measure thrown - on the table is accompanied not only by explanation, but also- by action which brings it before the House, and compels its discussion by honorable members, it has very little chance at all. If we introduce this Bill we must go on with it. Of course, the Government have their own ideas about it, but as the measure is one that can hardly be said to be a party matter in the ordinary sense of the term, the House can express an opinion upon it quite freely, and make of it ultimately what it pleases. Ministers certainly cannot regard it as something to which they are committed, beyond the fact that they are responsible for its introduction and passage through the House. </para>

However, I cannot see any means by which they can be reopened. Like other firms, Vestey Brothers carry on their business on a commerical basis, which postulates that if 20s. is put into a business the return should be at least 20s. It is suggested that Vestey Brothers should not look for a return of more than 15s., 10s., or 9s. for every &#163;1 they spend. Naturally; under such circumstances, they might be expected to close their works. </para>

It is amazing that after twelve months thousands of applications should not have been made, but such is the position.

              <para>- I must ask the honorable member to exercise his own judgment upon the point. It may or may not be as he states. All I know is that for the past twelve months I have been almost pestered, by honorable members opposite in particular, to permit a more general cashing of bonds, and, generally, to provide greater facilities in that direction. The purpose of the Government has been to protect returned men to the fullest possible extent, and we have done so; but many have disposed of their bonds before there has been any opportunity for inquiry at all. </para>

This class of legislation has been put into effect by Great Britain, and also by Canada. I am npt quite sure whether my memorandum covered the details of the Canadian legislation; but, in the course of my remarks upon the occasion in question, I gave to the House the whole of the information available. Meanwhile I have noticed that Belgium proposes to introduce legislation to effect similar ends. I have not yet obtained a* copy of that measure, and I doubt if one is available.  </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honorable member&#39;s questions is as follows :  - 1 to 5. Yes. With a view to the discovery and development of new sources of mineral oil within the Empire, an agreement was entered into between the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia for oil development in Papua. It was agreed that both Governments should share the expenses of investigations by the AngloPersian Oil Company (which has acted in various instances as agent for the British Government, and has specialized in the development of oil-fields within the Empire), the liability of either Government being expressly limited to &#163;50,000, and the mineral oil, if discovered in commercial quantities, to be worked in such manner as was mutually agreed upon for the joint benefit of both Governments, the proceeds being divided equally between them. As indications seemed more promising in New Guinea territory than in Papua, the Commonwealth Government approved of the company&#39;s geological staff proceeding with the examination of the oil country in the former territory, and negotiations have for some time been carried on with the British Government, with a view to its sanctioning the extension of the original agreement to cover the operations&#39; now being carried out in ex-German New Guinea.. No reports have yet been received as to the result of the investigations to date. </para>

              <para>No. Grading of cheese for export, until recently, was mainly performed by State officials acting for the Commonwealth. Complaints from merchants in England regarding the unsatisfactory condition of Queensland cheeses were received. All cheese submitted for export in Queensland is now graded entirely by Commonwealth officers. </para>

              <para>So far as the Commonwealth is concerned, there is now no dual system of grading cheese submitted for export. The whole of the grading is carried out by Commonwealth officers under the supervision of a cheese expert. State legislation in Queensland, however, requires all cheese produced to be graded, whether for export or not; but, until the cheese is actually submitted for export, the Commonwealth cannot interfere. Recently, owing to State officials insisting on State laws being carried out in regard to cheese intended for export, a large quantity of cheese was held up; but, to protect exporters from hardship and inconvenience in consequence of thathold up, the Commonwealth allowed the cheese to be exported bearing grade marks which were inconsistent with Commonwealth grade marks. </para>

              <para>See replies to questions 1 and 2. In order to preserve uniformity in cheese grading throughout the Commonwealth, it is necessary that Commonwealth grading should continue as at present. </para>

              <para>- I was, and I have great respect for the Senate as an institution. It is part of the Constitution ; and while that is so, every member of the Senate, in my opinion, is entitled to aspire to any office available under the Constitution.  I  make no qualification of that statement, although I can see that it would be unworkable, for example, to have the position of Prime Minister or that of Treasurer held by a member of the Senate. </para>

          <para>I am sure that the majority of us cordially appreciate the action of the Imperial Government in inviting Australasia  to send a delegate to the Washington Disarmament Conference. &#34; Disarmament,&#34; by the way, is not a very appropriate term; because, while disarmament may mean a reduction or limitation of armaments, it may also mean depriving a nation of arms altogether, and thus rendering it defenceless. </para>
          <para>I approve of the selection, of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> by the Government. To those honorable members who are finding fault with that gentleman, I point out that there is one criterion or test by which they may judge of his fitness. That criterion is the fact that for many years he has held office as Minister for Defence. If half what is said against him by some uninformed critics outside were true, he could not possibly have held that office for so long a time. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> ever since the establishment of Federation ; and while I do not altogether agree with his administration - I can see defects, and I suppose we can all see the defects, in the administration of others - 1 believe he will carry out his duties asrepresentative with dignity to himself and to the Commonwealth; and I am quite sure that when he returns he will give a comprehensive and intelligent report of what has taken place at the Conference. </para>
          <para>Personally, I am in favour of instructing our delegate to reaffirm the recognition of the principle set out in Article 8 of the covenant of the  League  of Nations, namely, that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety. I would have our delegate instructed to use his best endeavours to induce- the United States of America to join the League of Nations. I admit that if we take a short view of poor humanity, and- keep too much in mind our own failings - if we remember that at the commencement of the war it was said it would be the last, and that we were to have a &#34;better world made safe for Democracy &#34; - we may be inclined to agree with speakers like the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> and others, who seem to be of opinion that it is impossible ever to establish the peace of the world, and that war may break out at any time in the immediate future. But if honorable members will take a longer view, if they will cast their minds over the histories they have read- </para>

              <para>- Not twenty-five years, but 2,000 years. We have to remember that, according to Julius  Caesar,  the great Roman general, who invaded the British Isles 2,000 years ago, our ancestors painted themselves with clay, and clothed themselves with the- skins of animals. We have to consider the progress of civilization. Our police system is not of very ancient origin, as &#34;it was introduced, I think, only about 200 years age. If we go back centuries in the history of our own race we find that the duty of carrying out the police work was left to certain men, the heads of the &#34;hundreds,&#34; the village commune, and, indeed, it was everybody&#39;s duty at one time to act as a constable. In the progress of time, instead of permitting men to settle their differences by the use of clubs or other means, we established a police system which is so successful that to-day in Australia, for instance, one can safely go from one end of the continent to the other without finding it necessary to use firearms in self-defence. These facts indicate the progress of civilization. If we carry the analogy further we can easily picture the time when at least the civilized nations of the earth will join together to prevent nations from entering into deadly combat with one another. For my part, I entertain the greatest hope of the Allies engaged in the recent war establishing a workable basis for the maintenance of international peace through the League of Nations. </para>

          <para>There were very few native-born Australians who prior to the war thought that we would ever be engaged in any international conflict. That was due probably to the fact that we are so far away from Europe. Indeed, I remember that when the question was raised twenty years ago of the payment of a subsidy for the maintenance of the British Navy the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier said that Canada, did not wish to contribute, because that Dominion had no desire to be involved -in European complications. The United States of America, with its Monroe doctrine of &#39; non-interference in America by European powers, for years kept out of European quarrels. The recent war, which arose, apparently, out of the assassination of  the ArchDuke Ferdinand and his wife at Serajevo on the 28th June, 1914, but was no doubt due to deep and divergent racial and political interests,brought about war between Austria andServia, and in one week Australia was involved in the great conflict which followed, and in which twenty-six nations were eventually engaged. Any thoughtful man must realize that in any war in the future between the civilized Powers Australia is certain to be a party.We must not forget that fact. Memories are, apparently, very short. Two or three years ago we would have looked with horror at the suggestion that there might be further wars; perhaps it is well that our memories are short, because life&#39;s pilgrimage would otherwise be too painful. </para>
          <para>It is, however, the duty of the leaders of public thought not to forget, or, if they do, to read those publications which may act as reminders of what has taken place. </para>

              <para>- We had last night an exhibition from the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> of the oratory that we may expect unless the civilized races of the earth are prepared to depart from a policy that led to the loss of 7,000,000 lives and . the wounding of 18,000,000 men in the recent war. I believe the honorable member for Barrier is perfectly sincere in his convictions when he gets up and talks of a war against the capitalist class. </para>

              <para>- I have no desire to enter into a discussion on these matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker;</inline> but if the honorable member for Darling will interject he must expect to get something in return. Honorable members will agree that the speech made by the honorable member for Barrier was relevant to the issue, and. I want to point out that the nations of the world must choose between a practical and peaceful course of action and the doctrines of wild men like the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine),</inline> who is very much in earnest, but his absurd doctrines are quite impossible in a civilized community.  His  doctrines would lead to the introduction in Australia of the Russian Soviet, under which Lenin and Trotsky and the other leaders of that crowd have so entrenched themselves that only. those who support &#39;the system can &#39;to-day obtain food, while millions of unfortunate victims outside the charmed circle are starving in various parts of Russia. </para>

Nearly everybody in a civilized community today can read and write, and when people, who through no fault of their own find themselves out of employment, and observe, as the result of war conditions, that certain other individuals are compiling immense fortunes ; and, further, when they observe the extravagances of certain sections of the community, the looseness, and the generally lowered moral tone of the community, all the outcome of war, they are tempted to say, &#34;We shall end all this.&#34; The honorable member for Barrier would try to end it by the establishment of the Russian Soviet <inline font-style="italic">regime.</inline></para>

But seeing that the honorable member himself dealt rather exhaustively with the Russian Soviet system in his speech, I do not see how he can very well raise a point of order when the honorable mem ber for Capricornia attempts to say something in the nature of a reply. </para>

              <para>- It will be a pity if honorable members do not realize the importance of the question of what we areto do after the war. Foreign politics should be discussed more often in this Chamber. Our foreign policy should be considered here, instead of the trivial matters which sometimes occupy our attention. There are 42,000unemployed in Queensland. There are millions of men in a similar plight in the United States of America and in Great Britain, and it is no doubt due to causes attributable to the war. What is the alternative to the grand Council of Action, of which the honorable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis</inline> are members ? The alternative is the League of Nations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney speaks of the League contemptuously, and the honorable member for Barrier regards it as a capitalist combination. I look upon it as one of the hopes of the world. It is the flower which has grown out of the blood-stained battlefields, and we ought to support it. We are a member of it. Last year we spent &#163;68,350 on the League of Nation&#39;s, and this year our contribution is to be &#163;26,000. If the League cannot bring about a reduction of armaments, I do not see how the Disarmament Conference can do so. I would not throw cold water on the project. I am glad that the British Government has invited us to send a delegate, and I hope America will find that it must come into the League. The zeal, I presume, of some of our British statesmen is responsible for the United States of America remaining outside the League. These statesmen demanded that the British Empire should have six votes, and be considered six States. That meant that, according to article 3 of the Covenant, there would be three delegates each from Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. The British Empire embodies all those States, and thus would be entitled to eighteen delegates, while America would have only three. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I shall be able to answer that. The League was formed as an outcome of the war, when the statesmen of Europe, and President Wilson, saw the suffering due to the war, the ruined homes, the widows, the orphans, the wounded, the crippled, and the blind, and they determined that something must be done to prevent future wars.

Nearly the whole of them were represented at the Assembly of the League at Geneva last year, and I believe nearly all of them are represented, and some other States as well, at the Conference now sitting at Geneva. Unfortunately, so little information is given regarding this League, which is the hope of the world, that we do not even know the names of the delegates. Of course, we have the name of our own representative (Captain Bruce), and we occasionally hear such names as those of Lord Robert Cecil and Monsieur Noblemaire. But we have nothing like the information which should be at our disposal. Article 8 of the Covenant states - </para>

            <para>The members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety, and the enforcement by common action of international obligations. The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments. . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I have been asked &#34;What has this League of Nations done in regard to the reduction of armaments?&#34; Part of the duty of the League and its Council is to , ascertain what are the military and naval proposals of the nations. A book of questions has been sent out to the different Governments, with a view to ascertaining what their military and naval proposals are. Apparently, this matter has not been taken up as enthusiastically as it should have been. Although we in Australia are entitled to receive a book of questions as to our proposals in regard to armaments, apparently we have not got one. At least, if the Government have received one, this House knows nothing about it. In 1920, apparently, the most that the League of Nations could do with regard to the reduction of armaments was to consider the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Charles</inline> Lange, of Norway, that the only practical way to effect a reduction of armaments was to reduce the Budgets of the different countries for naval and military expenditure. This is the duty of all the nation in the League of Nations. On the basis of this suggestion the Assembly of the League evolved a resolution calling upon the Council, which is the other branch of the League, to submit for the consideration of the Assembly the acceptance of an undertaking not to exceed for the first two years following the next financial year the sum total of expenditure on the military, naval, and air services provided for in the next financial year. </para>
          <para>To show the difficulty with which  President  Harding is faced in this matter, I may mention that that resolution was withdrawn because it required unanimity, and the best the League could do was to get a recommendation carried. The opposition to the resolution was led by Prance. This recommendation was to submit for the consideration of members the acceptance of an undertaking not to exceed the current military Budget during the next two years unless required to do so by recommendation of the League, or by reason of exceptional circumstances notified to the League. The recommendation was carried by a large majority. That happened in 1920. </para>
          <para>Honorable members will see in the very sparse information which has been given to us:.&#39; &#39; in the .cable messages that the present Assembly at Geneva has approved of Lord Robert Cecil&#39;s report in reference to that matter. Lord Robert Cecil proposed the summoning of an International Conference in 1922 for the control of the private manufacture and traffic in arms. He also proposed the renewal of the request that all nations should agree not to increase their naval and military Budgets for the next two years over those of the current year. The resolution to adopt the report was carried. </para>
          <para>Honorable members will have seen that Monsieur Noblemaire, representing Prance, said that that country would give full support to the practical realization of disarmament, but demanded that there should be power to make investigations in all countries. &#34; France,&#34; he is reported to have said, &#34;was anxiously watching the tragedy which was being enacted in Germany between the spirit of work, peace, and Democracy, and the spirit of war of the junkers. Prance was bound to keep an army in readiness. It was not her fault that circumstances compelled her to be ready to act as the world&#39;s police.&#34; </para>
          <para>When  President  Harding meets the Conference delegates at Washington, and speeches are made by him and other delegates in favour of peace; when the delegates have been supplied with statistics concerning the huge indebtedness of the nations as a result of the late war; and when it is proposed that there shall be a reduction of armaments, the French delegation will express again the views that have been expressed on behalf of France during the last week or two at the Geneva Conference of the League of Nations. I have no doubt that  President  Harding will find that he can make no quicker progress than is being made by the present League of Nations. He will find that he will have to proceed in the same leisurely way. I do not believe for a moment that Monsieur Noblemaire, , and the other Frenchmen who are unable to agree to a reduction of armaments, represent the opinion of the people of France. I do not believe that the objections to an endeavour to establish the world&#39;s peace, such as were made in the speech by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who referred to what might happen in Poland owing to the warlike spirit of the population there, represent public opinion throughout the world. To my mind, the public opinion of the world is in favour of a union of civilized nations to reduce armaments and to lighten the burdens which the people have to carry. I believe that people welcome this League of Nations. They will support it, and will maintain it. I believe that the Washington Conference which  President  Harding has called is . the outcome of public opinion in the United States of America. I read, during the presidential campaign, that  President  Harding&#39;s opponent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cox,</inline> the democratic candidate, asked, &#34; What does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harding</inline> propose to put in place of the League of Nations?&#34; He added, &#34; He has nothing to propose, because there can be nothing put in the place of the League.&#34; In my opinion, the Washington Conference will fail to bring about a reduction of armaments; and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the British delegation, and the other people who go there, will try to induce the United States of America to join the League of Nations, because only in that way can we bring about the desired reduction. I believe that only with the joining up of the United States of America with the League of Nations will the aims and objects of the League be obtained. In the absence of the United States of America, we cannot hope that the League will do what might otherwise be done. </para>

            <para>These references to China are very disturbing. China, as a member of the League, is entitled to the protection of all the other nations which signed the Covenant, under which they agreed to respect the integrity of the territory of the members of the League. These references to &#34; The open door &#34; and &#34; Equality of commercial and industrial opportunity,&#34; remind me of the attitude of the Allied Nations at the time of the Boxer rebellion some, twenty years ago, when it was actually proposed that China should be divided among the &#39;nations which suppressed that rebellion. These references are those of a superior Power dealing with a subject race, and I am alarmed at their terms. Itwould appear that the United States of America propose to get into touch with a number of other nations and to come to some agreement with them regarding China. </para>

              <para>- Yes, it took over two years to do it. In Australia we can surely claim that we have, at least, 300.000 soldiers. We sent away 330,000 to the Great War of 1914-1918 and 260,000 of them came back to Australia. If we recruited our forces, on the plan adopted by the Boers, from boys of 14 to men of 60 years of age, I presume that we could muster an army of quite 1,000,000 troops. Japan would have to bring an army here to meet those troops,  and Japan would also require to obtain money for that purpose, and the only nation in the position to lend money to Japan to-day is the United States of America, which is supposed to be preparing for a war with that country. People remind us that we have in Australia a territory of 2,974,501 square miles inextent, with a population of something over 5,000,000, but they should remember that Japan controls Formosa, Korea, Manchuria, and on the borders of Manchuria is Mongolia, with an area of 1,367,600 square miles, and a population estimated at 2,600,000. The Japanese may go there. It will interest the honorable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fleming),</inline> who is a pastoralist, to know that the Japanese are taking sheep from Australia to Mongolia and that they may be competitors of the honorable member and his colleagues in the pastoral industry of Australia. </para>

I notice from the meagre information supplied by the press that at the conference of &#34;the Assembly it was decided by a majority of 120 delegates to 5 to carry out the covenant of the League for the restriction of that traffic. Will any member of this House affirm that the attitude of the French delegates who opposed the restriction of the white slave traffic represents the public opinion of so enlightened a race as the French people? I do not believe it for a single moment. I believe that, like a number of other socalled leaders of public opinion, these delegates have got out of touch with the real sentiments of the people generally since the Great War.

            <para>.- I regret that during the course of this debate the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference at Washington have been discussed as if they were to some extent antagonistic. I see no justification whatever for that view. Personally, I am a warm supporter of both the League of Nations and of the  proposal of the United States President to bring about general disarmament of the nations. The Conference which is to meet at &#34;Washington shortly should be regarded as complementary and supplementary to the work already done by the Leagueof Nations, and as in no sense opposed to their ideal. It is regrettable that the United States of America did not see its way to join the League of Nations, but their reasons, no doubt, seemed sufficient to the people of that country. But other nations should not regard the attitude of America as deserving of reproach or as a reason why the forthcoming Conference should not receive the generous support and assistance from all people who, like myself, and I believe every honorable member of this Chamber, love peace rather than war. The question immediately before the House is not <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> much the necessity for the representation of Australia at the Conference as it is the method by which our representative should be chosen. In considering the method of selection, it is perhaps well to consider the objectives of those who desire that the nations of the world shall participate in the Conference. It also seems necessary to consider what is likely to be the attitude of Australia. I agree that Australia should be represented at the Conference; but it is highly important that this country should not be misrepresented. More attention should have been paid inside and outside this House to what is likely to be the attitude of Australia&#39;s representative at the Conference, because it seems to me that there is some danger of our being misrepresented. Not that I have anything to say against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has been chosen by the Government. </para>

              <para>- Before the adjournment I unwittingly amalgamated the lines of two beautiful hymns, and only wish that I could as easily amalgamate in one representative to America the views and desires of all parties in this House. I do not think that the wisest course has been followed in the matter of appointing a representative of Australia to attend the Washington Conference. The questions to be considered by it are of the utmost possible importance to the whole of the people of this Commonwealth, and the gentleman appointed to represent us should have been the free choice of all the members of this Legislature. I am not prepared to say upon whom the choice should have fallen, or to discuss the relative merits of any possible candidate for the position; but I contend that whoever had been chosen in the manner I suggest w6uld have felt that, in representing us at Washington, he would have had behind him the preliminary approval of the people of Australia. It is difficult to know what is in the minds of all those who desire to have Australia represented at this Conference, but it is of the utmost importance that there should be ample discussion upon the matter in some form or another. </para>

            <para>.- It is very hard for an honorable member to criticise the appointment of any gentleman to represent Australia at the Washington Disarmament Conference, but it would be better if the choice had fallen upon one who could go abroad with the best wishes and good feeling of every citizen of Australia. In selecting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the Government have made the worst possible choice. All over the world the working classes are crying out for a permanent peace, and I trust that the forthcoming Conference will take us a step nearer to that end, although personally I have not much faith in its being able to do anything in that direction. I agree with the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> that before we can effect a cure for war we must get at and deal with its causes. The old-time diplomacy which was practised prior to the outbreak of 1914is not yet extinct. I am very much afraid that the diplomats of to-day will engineer another war as they did in 1914. At any rate, if any good is to emerge from the Washington gathering we want men at it who are truly desirous of bringing about the peace of the world. In 1906, no one was stronger than was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in his denunciation of militarism. I listened to him in those days with pleasure, when on many platforms he was denouncing the growth of the military spirit throughout the world. He was a pacifist then. He is not the same man to-day. He is a militarist. At the dictation of the military classes of this country he has been insisting on putting boys of sixteen years of age into training camps for seventy days each year. He it was who conscripted Italians living in. Australia. I cannot forget the active part he took in the conscription campaign, nor help thinking of the attempt he made in the Senate a few weeks ago to thrust upon the Democracy of this country the British Army Act with all its faults and militarism. I cannot conceive of a man who would so act at the behest of the military classes as being a fit person to represent Australia at a Conference where the main issue for discussion is the question of disarmament or the limitation of armaments.  His  heart will not be in his task. All the time he will be thinking of what the military chiefs of Australia will be saying. We want to be represented by a man who will express the thoughts of the people of Australia, and impress them upon the Conference. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will not be able to give a true reflexion of the feelings of the people here. </para>

              <para>- He has already changed his views once or twice, and probably he is ready to make another change. He was a pacifist and anti-militarist. To-day his strongest supporter cannot charge him with being an anti-militarist. He carries out every recommendation made by the military chiefs. Throughout the war he, indorsed whatever they said. No matter what Parliament declared, the law was what the military heads of Australia declared it to be. </para>

          <para>Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were a desirable person to represent Australia, I contend that the choice should have been made from among honorable members in this Chamber. I do not ask, as the honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has asked, that the selection should be made by all the members of this Parliament. I agree with the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector Lamond)</inline> that we should be guided by the traditions established under the British Constitution, as to the exercise of the powers of responsible government. But I hold that the Government in the exercise of their responsibility should have chosen some one who, having a seat in this Chamber, would be responsible to the House of Representatives. The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Higgs)</inline> has asserted that the Senate has equal rights with this Chamber. I deny the contention. Honorable senators have not been elected upon the same democratic principle as have honorable members of this House. The basis of representation is not equitable. New South Wales, for example, with its large population, provides only six members of the Senate, while Tasmania, with its small population, also has six. Honorable members know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> pretty well; they know that he will take very little note of anything that may be said from this side of the House. No man in Australia, apart from the military class, wishes to see another war. No man in this country, no matter how wealthy he may be, &#39;desires another outbreak of international hostilities ; but there are influences being exerted throughout the world, which, if they are permitted to expand, will precipitate another war. What I would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to declare at Washington, and to lay down most emphatically to the financial institutions of Great Britain, is that if, because of their covetousness in seeking to exploit the markets of China, and in that way clashing with American and Japanese financial interests, war should break out between the United States of America and Japan, with Great Britain as the ally of the latter, not one Australian youth will leave these shores to fight with any yellow race against a white people. I have just read, in the local press, that the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Ex-press,</inline> discussing the possibility of war between the United States of America and Japan, said - </para>

          <para class="block">In what way are the interests of the working classes of Great Britain or of Australia threatened by the actions and efforts of any group of financiers operating in China ? The working people of the world may expect to get no gains from exploitations being carried on there ; all they can look for is the possibility of a great deal of suffering, misery, and loss. However, if that London journal be correct in its assertion, that we are again upon the verge of international hostilities, its comments can only refer to the fear and expectation of one war, namely, that wherein Great Britain and Japan will be in alliance against the white people of the United States of America. I can only say that it will take a great deal in the future to induce the Democracy of this country to leave its shores and fight again. There is not a shadow of doubt but that the workers of Australia willnever again be eager to participate in a war, no matter whether the flag under which they are asked to fight be the Union Jack or any other. If the great financial corporations find their interests so clashing in China that war is precipitated between the yellow race and the white peoples of America, there need be no misunderstanding in Great -Britain, or at the Washington Conference, about the attitude of the Australian workers. No matter though the Mother Land range herself with her yellow allies, Australians will not fight side by side with them in that alliance. It would not take much, indeed, to induce the workers, of this country to range themselves alongside their kith and kin in the United States of America against the Japanese. </para>

              <para>- Exactly the same. I trust, for the peace of the world, that the trade unions of this and every country will actively spread the gospel of peace. No war can bring gain to the working man. If a delegate could be sent to the Washington Conference who would speak clearly and distinctly in those terms to the representatives of the United Kingdom - men who know full well the value of the Australian soldier on a battlefield - something in the direction of disarmament might be brought about. The Australian delegate at Washington should not hesitate to tell the capitalistic authorities of Great Britain that never again will an Australian go to the aid of the British in any war in which they may be assisting a yellow race to fight white men. I have nofaith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have no expectation that he will utter such sentiments as those. </para>

Though honorable members on this side may be in the minority, I am confident, upon this matter of Great Britain allying herself with Japan in the event of war being precipitated with the United States of America, that we are speaking on behalf of the great majority of the people of Australia. I repeat that I regret the choice made by the Government. I shall vote for the amendment in the hope that the Government will select one who is truly a pacifist, and who will earnestly press at the Conference for the disarmament of the nations. </para>
