The Minister promised to refer the matter to Cabinet. Has a decision been arrived at concerning it, and, if so, has it been communicated to anybody? </para>

One company is under defintte contract to send its boats to Hobart during the apple season.

        <para>  With regard to the date when the hulls will ho started, the position I have taken up before the Royal Commission, and since taking up my duties, is that the work in connexion with the hulls will notbe commenced until the question of piecework is finally fixed.

            <para>- I shall take an opportunity of laying on the table to-morrow the resolutions passed at the Premiers&#39; Conference, and I shall consult the convenience of honorable members as to when any, or all, of these may be discussed. It is very obvious that we are confronted with a very great many matters of first class importance, many of which must be settled one way or the other without any delay. I mentioned two or three of them yesterday. Perhaps I may be permitted to recapitulate what I said. There is the question of the resumption of trading with Germany. On that I merely desire an expression of opinion by the House; I can get that from the remarks of honorable members during the discussion on the Estimates. There are the questions of wireless communication, airships, the continuance or otherwise of the CommonwealthShipping Line, and shipbuilding. I shall make a statement on an early day next week, covering both the two lastmentioned subjects. Other business to be dealt with by the House includes the discussion of the resolutions passed at the Premiers&#39; Conference, or such of them as interest or directly concern this Parliament; the anti-dumping legislation, which has been mentioned, and which the Minister for Trade and Customs has ready; the ConstitutionConvention Bill, which is now receiving the final touches, and will be ready for presentation as soon as the House has cleared the way for it; and, of course, the Estimates. Honorable members may be optimistic, and straining at the leash, but the matters I have mentioned appear to me to be a fairly formidable programme, and amply warrants the suggestion that the House should in future sit on Tuesdays, and, if necessary, on Mondays. I shall not propose to go any further at present. </para>

          <para>.- The rates of duty on this item as it left this Chamber were, British, 5s.; intermediate, 5s.; and general, 6s.; but the Senate has asked us to increase the intermediate rate to 6s., and the general rate to 7s.The Minister has now proposed, by way of compromise, to make the general rate 6s. 6d. ; and I understand that he also intends to propose a proportionate modification of the Senate&#39;s request that the general rate on timber, undressed, n.e.i., be 8s. 6d. The Minister made it clear some time ago that, if 12600 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> there were any anomalies in connexion with these timber duties, he would have them rectified in the Senate, and I cannot understand why he has not given sympathetic consideration to the Senate&#39;s request that the rates of duty upon undressed timber be increased. The timber industry of Australia has been in a very bad position for aconsiderable period, the slackness in trade having thrown hundreds of mill hands out of employment. Although it was urged when the duties upon timber were imposed that there would be an increase in the price of timber for building purposes, we find that to-day it is lower than it was before the imposition of the duties. The same arguments were advanced in regard to bananas; but, as a matter of fact, they are now cheaper than they were prior to the imposition of the duty. We ought to keep out foreign timber in order to provide employment for our own people; and, as a. step in this direction, we should not modify the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that there will be no further increase in the timber duties. Years ago, one could buy white pine almost at the rate per 100 super. feet now imposed as duty. Imported softwoods are necessary for the building, not only of homes for working people, but also of factories. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; and I cannot see why we should not be in a position to supply them with a moderate rate of duty as cheaply as they can be brought from overseas, after payjng heavy freights and overcoming the difficulties of adverse rates of exchange, which apply in the case of exportations from America, Sweden, and Norway, the countries from which we draw our supplies of softwoods. I am looking at the question from the point of view of the heavy cost which will be imposed on all sorts &#39;of developmental work, to say nothing of the building of workers&#39; homes and factories. Everybody will be called upon to pay more for timber. We are asked to impose a rate of 8s. 6d. per 100 super. feet on certain timber, but the importer will seek his percentage of profit, not only on what he pays to the exporter overseas, but also on the amount of duty. Timber will thus become abnormally expensive. I am not opposed to a small increase in the duty on dressed timber as compared with undressed. </para>

            <para>- That would be useless. I hope the Minister will not agree to an increase in the duties on undressed timber. I would offer no objection to an increased duty on dressed timber, but in the interests of trade in Australia generally I appeal to the Committee not to agree to any increase in respect of undressed timber. The additional impost will press very heavily on many industries, and will be expressed in the increased cost of all manufactures in which timber is used. </para>

            <para>- It was quite impossible, and I expressed my surprise that it should be allowed to leave the Committee in such a form. I thought that while the Tariff was being dealt with by another place the Minister would prepare a comprehensive scheme for the protection of the timber industry. This item when sent to another place was in a chaotic condition, and, as returned to us, it is even worse. I challenge the Minister to justify it. He is now proposing modifications that are useless from the point of view of the timber-getters. Will the Minister admit that he has handed us over to the Free Trade corner &#39;{ </para>

            <para>- Although I was not in the House at the time, I well remember the great fight that took place over the timber duties in the first Federal Tariff. That fight was repeated when the Tariff of 1908 was before us. The Minister does not seem to realize that a Protective Tariff in respect of timbers is of use to the timber-getters of Australia. It is time that we considered our timber interests. When the item was before us on a former occasion it was pointed out that this Government alone could deal effectively with reafforestation and the handling&#34; of om- timbers generally. It would be absurd to leave that work to the States, since they have neither the control nor the opportunity for giving encouragement. They might indulge in a little patchwork reafforestation, but this Parliament alone can handle in a comprehensive way the great timber interests of the Commonwealth. I am disappointed at the failure of the Government after months of consideration to realize this fact. I shall, unfortunately, have to take a share of the blame. In the very near future good Australians will be saying that I was one of those who allowed this item to pass in such a way as not to give proper consideration to our timber interests, and that my representations were so weak that the Minister would not listen to them. If the Minister does not propose, to make the item more acceptable, I, with a few others, will have to protract the debate with the object of inducing him to give us something like a Protective Tariff. The amount of money invested in the timber industry of Australia is of no concern to me. My concern is that under the item as it stands the men who earn their living by timbergetting will be thrown on the labour market, and will swell thb ranks of the unemployed. That will be the result of the clumsy way in which we are dealing with the timber duties. The mountain in labour has brought forth a mouse - and a mouse without any hair on it. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that admission. The honorable gentleman will agree with me that, in the absence of information as to what the Minister proposes to do in regard to other sub-items, it is necessary that we should deal at the same time with the whole of the requests made in another place in regard to the timber duties. Sub-item ,t, relating to timber for making boxes, was untouched by the Senate. Does the Minister consider that the item is sufficient to encourage the saw-mills operating in the Australian bush? If we were to deal with the item in such a way as to give real encouragement to that industry, we should have to raise all the other duties in order to secure a scientific Tariff. We have at last one admission from the Minister, who says he has considered the box industry, and will later deal with that phase. Personally, that suits me, though, if I liked to be narrow-minded and careless of broad Australian interests, I should have sole regard to the employees in the box industry, and in the timber yards, who are those with whom I am associated. The great timber interests, however, are at stake, and Victorian members know that the milling interests in certain constituencies are &#34; falling to pieces,&#34; while the position of affairs is even worse in other States. The Minister and his advisers are just as conversant as I am with the facts, and I really cannot understand his attitude. I know that he has gone into the matter, and he seems satisfied with what has been done. All I can say is that if he is satisfied he must have some information that is not in my possession. I am informed that not only the War Service Homes Mills, but private mills have such enormous stocks on hand that they are closing down ; yet at the same time1, w&#169; know that millions of feet of timber are being imported. It is really ghastly that this should be so. However, there are men  12602 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> here who represent constituenciesin which the milling is done, and if they are satisfied I suppose I shall have to be. I do hope, however, that the Minister will deal satisfactorily with sub-item J, and if he intends to do so I shall be satisfied for the present. The Minister must agree that the timber duties are not what are desired, even by himself. </para>

          <para>.- The request of the Senate, as I understand it, is merely to increase the duty in proportion to the work that is entailed in reducing the size of the timber. With the little knowledge I possess of the work, and I have some, it seems to me that1s. per 100 super. feet is not a sufficient increased protection for the work that is entailed in reducing the timber from the sizes named in the previous item. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has moved an amendment that the Senate&#39;s request be acceded to with an alteration which will mean 6s. 6d. per 100 super. feet in the general Tariff instead of 7s., an increase of1s. as compared with the previous item. This, of course, means that the workmen engaged in reducing the size of the timber will get some protection; but I do not think that1s. is sufficient, but rather that it should be1s. 6d., according <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Senate&#39;s request. I have been informed that the Minister, or the Department, agreed to this request. In another place, the increase moved was much greater, and I thought that the request sent to us was a compromise made with the Minister&#39;s permission. I am therefore rather surprised that the honorable gentleman has not agreed to the full amount. I do not wish to stress the necessity of protecting the timber industry; we had a full debate when the Tariff was previously before us, and I see no good in the repetition of arguments. I certainly think, however, that this Committee ought to. and will, support&#39; the request made by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- There is some relation, but the request of the Senate is merely to continue the proportionate increases according to the work entailed in reducing the size of the timber, and I ask the Committee to seriously consider whether the increase requested by the Senate is too much even by one penny. The Minister&#39;s amendment&#39; I regard as insufficient, as anyone acquainted with the industry would say. However, I do not think it worth while to further discuss the matter, because no doubt honorable members will vote in accordance with their votes on the last occasion. </para>

To-day I have been speaking with a gentleman who has twelve sawmills in Victoria, air of which are now closed. This has resulted in the discharge of 400 men. The closing of the mills is due to the importation of so much cut-up timber. The same thing is happening in New South Wales. There is a big bos factory and timber mill on the Parramatta River. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that, through illness, I was not able to be present when the timber duties were originally discussed in ,this Chamber. Had I been here, I should have supported the proposal of the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell),</inline> with a view to securing decent treatment for the industry. At the present time the timber industry is in a bad position. I do not think that the Tariff could cure all the ills from which it is suffering. One reason for its present condition is a wages award, which, in some cases, was made retrospective for <inline font-style="italic">as-</inline> much as fourteen and sixteen months. Then there has been dumping, because many American mills had overcut, and were glad to sell their surplus at any price they could get for it. A further cause is the exorbitant royalty charged by State Governments. In some cases, within three years, the royalty on standing pine has increased from ls. 6d. to 17s. 6d. per hundred super. feet, which, of course, increases the cost of timber to the user. I understand that we cannot deal freely now with the timber duties as a whole, because some df our original proposals have been agreed to by the Senate, but the anomalies in the Tariff should be removed as far as possible. It is .absurd (that dressed timber should come in at the same rate as undressed timber. Since the present duties were imposed, the price of timber has been going down, though that has not been due to the Tariff. Imported timber has dropped from 30s. to 18s. There should be a greater difference between the duty on undressed timber and that om dressed timber. I shall support the Senate&#39;s request as being the best thing we can now do for the protection of the. timber industry. I wish to emphasize what has been said by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> in regard to  sub-item J.  I think that the Minister should take steps to correct the anomaly to which he referred. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Minister will give effect to the recommendation of the Senate. No other State is as much affected by these timber duties as Queensland, where, at the present time, a large number of sawmills are closed, because the duty on log and sawn timber is not sufficiently high, and there is not a sufficient difference between the duty on log and sawn imported timber. The firm of McKenzie and Company, of Sydney, set up mills on Fraser&#39;s Island, in Wide Bay, but these mills have recently been closed because there is no sale for the timber, the competition of imported timber being too severe. That is only one of many cases which has come to my knowledge of the recent closing of timber mills in Queensland as a result of which a large number of persons are suffering hardship. Many men had taken up land, hoping to sell the pine on it at a price that would assist them to cultivate it. That was done for a time; but so much timber is now coming from overseas that the local mills cannot make enough on what they cut. If the selectors&#39; timber is not sent to a saw-mill within a reasonable time, it becomes useless. The Senate, when it made its request, had before it the reports of the debates of this House on the duty on the timber industry, and took time to consider thoroughly the whole question. Under the Tariff as it stands, it pays a miller abroad to send sawn log timber here. If timber were imported only in the log, our saw-millers would get employment in cutting it up ; but the local owners of timber, timber getters, carriers, and railway employees would lose their employment. My experience of the timber industry extends over a period of fifty years, and I know that the industry was never before in so bad a state as at present. </para>

          <para>. - .When the timber duties were before the Committee originally, we threshed out matters thoroughly, and today I am more convinced than ever that more consideration should be given to the consumers&#39; point of view. We should look to the interests of the consumers as we&#39;ll as to those of the people who grow and cut the timber. One reason why we have such big, unused stocks of timber in the country is that prices are too high. There are many persons who wish to build, and who have been ready to build for a long time past, but .they are waiting for .the prices of timber to come down. What is to be the future of our industries? Do honorable members know the particulars of the last log of the Australian Timber Workers &#34;Union? If that log is accepted, engine-drivers, who have been receiving <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> 13s. a week, will get &#163;10 3s. a week. </para>

          <para>. - It seems extraordinary that, when any proposal is made to give a little bit of protection to the man in the bush, the Government turn it down. The Government should know, as well as I do, that nearly all the timber-mills are closed up, and the former employees are tramping the country, vainly searching for work. Yet, when, after mature consideration, the Senate proposes to do something to encourage the re-opening of the mills, the Government are unsympathetic. When I spoke on this item previously, I was told that I was an alarmist ; but, since that time, nearly all the mills have closed down. I do not think there is one mill operating in my district. It is not the present rate of wages that is objected to, but the rate of wages for which the workers have asked. I find that the log prepared by the Timber Workers&#39; Union provides that a man who is now receiving &#163;4 13s. shall receive &#163;10 3s., and that boys who receive &#163;1 13s. shall be paid &#163;4 10s. Other men earning &#163;3 per week are asking for &#163;7 16s. Will a policy of that kind set the mills going ? </para>

            <para>- Of course it has. Has the honorable member any sympathy with those men who are walking the roads and looking for work? He claims to represent in this Parliament only one section of the community. I do not.. But the fact that men are out of employment is of as much concern to me as to any other honorable member in the House. It is a scandal that when the Senate requests the Government to do something to help men who have invested their capital to get a fresh start with their mills, the Minister says that he cannot see his way clear to agree. Why ? Because he has a dumb-driven majority to support him. </para>

            <para>- I cannot be said to be a dumb-driven supporter. I admit that sometimes I vote for the Government against my own inclination; but that will be altered presently. If this were a proposal to help some industry in the city, the galleries would be filled with interested persons, &#34; lobbying &#34; would be taking place, and the Minister would become very sympathetic. But, because this duty affects the bush workers and mill-owners - who cannot come to Melbourne to &#34; push their barrow &#34; - the Government look at their interests with wonderful disdain. I have as much concern for men walking the roads in my district as have those honorable members who profess to represent the workers only. </para>

            <para>- The extra 6d. per 100 super. feet will make some difference. Apparently, the Minister&#39;s excuse is that his proposed reduction of duty is &#34; only a little one.&#34; The extra 6d. may not seem much, but it may mean bread and butter to some people.

I think the Senate&#39;s proposal is characterized by common sense, and is designed to help all interests - both the workers and the men who have invested their capital. I ask the Minister to give some consideration to bush industries. Men who, like myself, represent miners and timberworkers, have a hard row to hoe when trying to help along the natural industries in the country. When people see the Government and their supporters placing a heavy foot on all country industries, they are less inclined to invest their capital in them. I shall support the Senate&#39;s request, which means finding employment for men who are now out of work. </para>

          <para>.- This matter was thoroughly discussed when it was before the Committee some months ago. But I urge the Minister to pay heed to the request made by the Senate. That an additional duty is necessary is evidenced by the fact that during September no less than 9,500,000 feet of timber of the value of &#163;115,000 was imported. If that average be maintained throughout the year it will mean a total importation during the twelve months of timber worth well over &#163;1,350,000 - no small sum to be lost to the milling industry. Those figures prove that the duty we imposed on timber some few months ago is insufficient, and I hope the Minister will accede to the Senate&#39;s request. </para>

          <para>.- Honorable members do not realize that the sub-item now under consideration  has  nothing to do with the postponed subitem relating to undressed timber for boxmaking. When this schedule was framed the Minister fixed the duty at 4s. per 100 super. feet, with the idea of making it a purely revenue impost, although from that point of view I considered it was high. Honorable members do not seem to be aware that this item covers Baltic flooring, matchboarding, and all such timbers which are imported into Australia, and cannot be replaced by Australian timbers, except, possibly, the soft timbers of Queensland, of which there is only  a  limited supply. The other States cannot get suitable local timbers to replace Baltic flooring. </para>

            <para>- Jarrah is most unsuitable for flooring. I know that the numbers are against me, but that is because the majority of honorable members are ignorant of the effect of making this amendment. I know that some honorable members who have a few timber votes in their electorates are quite willing to saddle the whole community with this enormous impost, but I shall vote against it. This request was carried in another place when barely half the senators were present. There was no debate upon it.

          <para>.- When this question was before the Committee on a previous occasion, I did not speak, but voted with the Government. I thought that the duties proposed were fair. Since then the Saw-millers Association in my electorate, which contains a number of saw-mills with a large output of pine timber, have taken me to task for not championing their cause. The duties for which I had voted were lower than the Senate has requested us to make them. I am still of the same opinion today, and I propose to burn my boats by voting with the Government again. The duties proposed are too high. If it were not for the timber imported from overseas the worker would have very little chance indeed of getting a home. Last week-end, when I was in Sydney, I paid a bill for timber I had bought previously. I was charged the exorbitant price of 77s. per 100 super. feet for 12 in. by 1 in. Queensland pine. We are all aware how expensive it is to buy the timber of north Queensland, which is so suitable for making furniture. No one can get a bedroom suite made of silky oak or maple for less than &#163;40, and I am afraid that if it were not for ordinary timbers, such as Japanese oak, coming from abroad, the average Australian would be compelled to use kerosene cases and soap boxes for making his furniture. It would be utterly impossible for the man earning an average salary to buy furniture made of Queensland silky oak or maple, or Victorian blackwood, or Huon pine, the price of which is exceedingly high.  We  have heard a great deal about the dumping of timber in Australia from outside. It has also been said that this timber comes from countries where it is not produced by white labour. The latter remark cannot applyto Canada or Scandinavia, and can only apply to J apan ; but the timber from that country does not compete very seriously with the timbers of Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria, which are so suitable for furniture making. I have with me a summary of the values of imported timbers, as follows: - </para>

          <para>- Why cannot the Australian timber mills dispose of their timber? The reason is that the prices they are asking are so abnormally high. The Queensland gentlemen who interviewed me about the timber duties complained of the heavy royalty and freight charges and of the high wages they were compelled to pay. But I put the proposition to them, &#34; If the duties for which you are asking are imposed, will you be relatively any better off than you are now <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> As a matter of fact they will not, because an increase in the duty will probably lead to a demand for increased royalties and freights and for higher wages, so that, relatively, they will not be any better off than they were before. I have recently seen a paragraph in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> stating that a number of mills in Tasmania were closing, but the same paragraph mentioned the fact that the sawmill hands were asking for &#163;12 a week in wages. Were the mills closing because of timber importations or because of the wages the men were demanding ? Another reason for the closing of mills is that during the winter months it is almost impossible to get logs from the bush. However, when the timber people complain that they cannot sell their output, I reply that it is because of the exorbitant prices they are. asking, which penalize people who want to get homes of their own. The effect of these high prices is thus to reduce employment in the building trades, this reduction in building operations necessarily preventing the saw-millers from selling their timber. </para>

          <para>.- I should nob have risen again to discuss this request but for certain statements that have been made which I think it necessary to contradict. The honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Story)</inline> saidthat Baltic flooring, which is includedin this item, will be brought into Australia no matter what duties may be imposed - that we must have it, since, with the exception of a small quantity in Queensland, we have no timber in Australia that is suitable for flooring. That statement is not only inaccurate, but absolutely absurd. I invite him to ask any expert whether Baltic pine is better for flooring than hardwood. Our hardwoods are, and always will be, used for flooring. Where a good class of flooring is necessary - in halls, for example, where there is a lot of wear - no one would think of using Baltic pine. People would be&#39; prepared to pay any price for good Australian hardwood for such a purpose if it were hard to obtain; but, as a matter of fact, it is not. Compared with softwood, Australian hardwood is expensive to work, and that is why Baltic flooring is popular; but any one who says that we have not in Australia timber that is suitable for flooring makes a statement that is unfair and inaccurate. </para>

            <para>- What about the duty on chains and everything needed to bring the timber into tie mills, and to work it up there? All have been subjected to heavy duties, and the working costs of the mills must thus be increased. I am glad that the debate is not to be continued. Having regard to the way in which the Minister&#39;s last suggestion was received, I thought that the question of the duty on bananas might be revived and an increase made. That; again, would help the people to realize what they have to pay under this Tariff. From that point of view, it is almost to be regretted that some honorable mem- bershave not suggested the prohibition of the importation of timbers. Those who will feel the effect of these duties are people who want to build the poorer class of homes. Here we have a duty of 8s. 6d. per 100 super. feet, which, plus the importers&#39; profit, will be equal to11s. or 12s. per 100 super. We could get7/8in. white Baltic flooring for 9s. 6d. per 100 running feet fourteen or fif teen years ago. This is a preposterous duty, and I hope that the country will quickly recognise what it means. </para>

          <para>.- The Senate has requested us to increase very materially the duty on timber, undressed, cut to size, for makingboxes, but has left untouched the duty on timber dressed and partly dressed, cut to size, for making boxes. That is to say, the duty on timber, cut to size, dressed, for making boxes, is considerably less than the duty on the undressed timber; so that a position which is quite impossible has been created. The position is further complicated by the fact that we have arranged duties on other timbers which, when taken into consideration with those on timber for boxmaking, give rise to serious anomalies. I propose, therefore, not to agree to the Senate&#39;s request in this particular case, but to recast it. I move - </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is thinking of butter-box timber, for which provision has already been made. This modification will enable softwood for makingboxes to be brought in at a low rate of duty, and, although I recognise that it will lead to difficulty in regard to some sections of the box-making industry - the hardwood boxmakers will perhaps be at some disadvantage - still there is a great deal  of  the trade for which hardwood is utterly unsuitable. For instance, if jams, jellies, canned fruits, and such like goods were packed in hardwood cases, and were exposed to a little rain the stain would come out of the hardwood arid spread over the labels. Softwood must  be  12610 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> used for such boxes. We are trying to arrange for the admission, at a low rate of duty, of softwood timber for making cases which are used very largely for the packing of goods which we export, as well as use here. We propose a higher duty in respect of timber cut to size for making boxes. What we hope will happen as a result of this is that, instead of box shooks coming in cut to size, with all the work associated with them practically completed, the duty will lead to the work being done in this country. We hope that it will lead to the cutting up of the timber and the making up of the boxes being carried out in this country instead of abroad. The duty of 5s. is the old rate, which has been operating for some time. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; but it is practically impossible to reconcile all the conflicting interests of the timber business. I do not care how you try to do it ; you are up against difficulties whatever you do. I do not profess to be satisfied with the timber duties as they stand. I do not think it is possible to get a schedule of timber duties that is entirely satisfactory from any one point of view. The many conflicting interests make a tangled web through which I, at all events, cannot find my way. I repeat that I do not profess to be satisfied with these timber duties; but I think they represent the best that can be done in a very difficult position. I do not want to mislead the Committee in any way as to what I propose to do. I believe that this will be, if honorable members so like to describe it, detrimental to certain portions of the box-making industry; but, on the other hand, it will give a tremendous lot of employment in Australia, and will provide for a packing case that is suitable for a vast proportion of our export trade, and for which hardwood cases are unsuitable. </para>

            <para>- It might to some extent. However, I have made my proposal, and it is for the Committee to finally deal with the matter. There is one important point I should like to mention. If we agree to duties of 7s. 6d. and 8s. 6d., and we have to provide for duty on timber for these cases cut to size in shooks, it will result in penalizing a number of our industries to no purpose, because those concerned are obliged to go outside Australia to get a large proportion of their softwood cases. </para>

            <para>- I know the position in Queensland ; there is a limited quantity there for this particular purpose, but it cannot be made available all over Australia at a reasonable price. As I have said several times, I do not pretend that the solution I propose is entirely satisfactory, because from some points of. view it is entirely unsatisfactory. The difficulty is to reconcile all the conflicting interests concerned, and to choose a path which is in the best interests of the community. The proposal, for which I admit I am myself responsible, is the only one which seems to me to reasonably meet the position from a manufacturing point of view, and, at the same time - and this is just as important, if not more so - meet the point of view of the persons who use these cases. </para>

          <para>.- The definition of box is a very wide one, coveringanything from a big packing case to a small cigar box. Has the Minister made any provision in connexion with the introduction of timber for the manufacture of the latter? At present, it is impossible for Queensland millers to compete with the timber that is sent over from Borneo; and as the duty which the Senate has seen fit to suggest in the general Tariff is not sufficient to make it feasible to use Australian-grown timber, I should like the Minister, if possible, to have an added duty placed on timber imported for this purpose. </para>

          <para>.- The Senate has requested us to do two things - to make the duty immediately operative, and to increase it 10 per cent. all round. I do not propose to accept the Senate&#39;s amendment <inline font-style="italic">in toto;</inline> but I shall accept it with a modification. Thereare three firms concerned in the manufacture of chamois leather, the largest of which is Michaelis, Hallenstein and Company Proprietary Limited, which has imported an expensive plant. Because of difficulties in connexion with the instalment of this plant, that firm has not yet produced any leather, and will be satisfied if the duty is made operative a little later on. The firm of Brock and Meadows are manufacturing chamois leather in a small way, and a third firm in Brisbane has been manufacturing it for some little time. This last firm has seen the need of meeting competition by erecting a new factory and installing new machinery, and it expects to manufacture on a large scale very shortly. </para>

            <para>- It is only fair to say that representatives of these firms asked me some time ago whether, if they went to the expense of arranging to manufacture chamois leather in this country, the Government would propose an import duty on that article, and I told them, as I have told many other persons, that the general policy of the Administration was to protect new industries. I did not make a promise to them, nor did I say what duty, if any, would be proposed. I told them that the Government was in the hands of Parliament, and that it was for them to decide whether they should take the risk of entering into the business under the conditions I had outlined. Therefore, although they embarked in this industry before a duty had been proposed, they naturally expected some Tariff assistance. I propose to accept the rates suggested by the Senate, which inquiries that have been made since the matter was discussed in this Chamber have justified; but I do not think they should be made operative immediately. There are technical difficulties in the manufacture of chamois leather, and we wish to know that it is being made on commercial lines, and with a reasonable chance of meeting the requirements of Australia, before we make the duty operative. I therefore move. - </para>

Before the war practically none of this footwear was made in Australia. The Government is anxious that our manufacturers shall retain this extremely valuable business which they have made for themselves. Of ordinary boots, such as probably most of us wear, I do not think there are a dozen pairs imported annually; but, until very recently, boots and shoes of the higher grades have been imported in very large quantities. During the war our manufacturers, with an enterprise wholly admirable, set themselves, as I have said, to manufacture the better class as well as the cheaper class of goods, and not only did they supply the local requirements, but they exported largely to New Zealand. </para>

          <para>. -  I am surprised that the Minister has proposed this modification. This Committee, after the fullest consideration of the whole subject, fixed the duties on boots, shoes, and other footwear at 40, 45, and 50 per cent., realizing that the boot manufacturing industry was one of the most valuable in the country.I understand that our boot factories number some 500, that there is a capital of upwards of &#163;1,500,000 invested in the industry, that the annual wages bill is something like &#163;2,250,000, and that, normally, 18,000 persons are employed. During the past year or two, owing to slackness of trade, the employment has decreased, and the number of hands now employed is not 50 per cent. of those who were employed when we were going full steam ahead. To reduce the duties will very considerably increase the importations of boots, and, in my opinion, in view of the new machinery that has recently been installed for the making of the higher classes of footwear, there should be no importations at all. Our manufacturers are capable of supplying the needs of Australia. </para>

            <para>- With the best results. In 1914, the duties in operation were 35 percent. on the British preferential Tariff, (and 40 percent. on the general Tariff, and in that year boots and shoes to the value of &#163;672,000 were imported, as against importations valued at &#163;601,000 in 1913, at &#163;546,377 in 1912, and at &#163;382,000 in 1911. Our experience has been that if the rates of duty are reduced, even by 5 per cent., importations immediately increase. At the present time a deliberate attempt is being made, by American. manufacturers in particular, to capture the Australian market, and we should, therefore, give the fullest protection to our manufacturers. </para>

            <para>- The boots I have on were locally made, and I do not think that I have ever, during the whole course of my life, worn boots that were not made in Australia. We have factories capable of supplying all the footwear needed in Australia, and we are now able to manufacture boots of the best class. At a time when the industry is experiencing slackness, and other nations are endeavouring to exploit our markets, we should stand by our manufacturers,  and  refuse to encourage importations from abroad. </para>

          <para>.- Upon one point the Minister should enlighten the Committee when he asks us to reduce the duty previously imposed. The Senate has recommended a . 10 per cent. reduction, and the Minister proposes to compromise with a 5 per cent. reduction. Doeshe suggest a 5 per cent. reduction upon any principle? Has he any reason for thinking that the duty should 12614 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> be reduced, or does he take this step only for the purpose of placating the Senate?

            <para>- The Minister said that ultimately the goods would drop in price, as a result of the fostering of the industry producing them. The boot industry has enjoyed high Protection for thirty years. Under the State <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> high duties were imposed by the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best).</inline> In pre-Federation days Western Australia imposed a high duty on boots. The first Federal Tariff continued those duties. The Senate takes the view that the duty agreed to by this Committee should  be  reduced by 10 per cent., and the Minister has taken a reasonable view, and compromised by proposing a reduction of 5 per cent. Why does the honorable member for Kooyong think that the Minister is wrong ? No industry is more firmly established in Australia than the manufacture of boots. If local manufacturers can produce so successfully that almost 100 per cent.  of  Australian boot requirements are locally made of local material, there is very little need for a high Protective duty. We are told that the purpose of a high Tariff is  to  foster local production, and that that will ultimately reduce the price of the article  to  the consumer. But the manufacturers are using the high Tariff to maintain the high prices of  boots.  The prices the consumers have  to  pay, having regard to the price  at  which the manufacturer purchases his leather, are exorbitant and  extortionate.  The manufacturers argue that practically  all  the leather they import is governed  by  the general Tariff, but a good deal of the imported leather comes from New Zealand. There is a reciprocal arrangement between the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and last night weremoved altogether the duty from  New  Zealand leather. </para>

          <para>- I agree that they cannot be produced in Australia, but there are some honorable members who argue that they can be. The high duties are not assisting the Australian people to get cheaper boots. Notwithstanding the reduction in the price of leather, we are not getting boots for much, less than we were paying six months ago. Even under war conditions, we had to pay an exorbitant price for boots. The Australian manufacturer should be able to supply boots much cheaper than they are being sold to the public now, but while the big duties are maintained, the high prices will continue. I desire the employees in the boot industry to receive a fair wage, and that as many men and women as possible shall be employed, but this everlasting increase in duties is merely placing an extra impost upon the users of boots. If I had my way the duties would be lowered much beyond what the Senate hasrequested. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the compromise proposed by the Minister will be agreed to. The bootmaking industry has arrived at a stage when the promises made by earlier Protectionists in Victoria should be fulfilled, namely, that when the industry reached maturity, the public would commence to get something like natural value for their money. This industry has been protected for nearly forty years. The  1908-11  Tariff imposed a duty of  30  per cent. on boots and shoes, the  1914  Tariff  35  per cent., and the duty agreed to by this Committee was  40  per cent. (British preferential&#93;). For forty years there has been a continual increase in the amount of Protection. Apparently, the consumer is regarded as  a  milch cow, and the Tariff as a means of enabling the Combine of manufacturers to exploit the public to the utmost. The community has a right to expect some consideration from an. industry which has been protected so long and so highly. I am glad to know that a very high class of boot is made in Australia, but it is no argument in favour of high Protection to say that manufacturers have installed uptodate machinery. Protection has enabled them to gain practically the whole of Australia&#39;s trade, but, in spite of that, there are still a few people) - and in white countries, too - who are able to send boots to Australia cheaper than they can be produced locally. It is a reflection upon the country that an oldestablished industry should still require high Protection. This claim suggests that we are living on a plane different from that of other countries of the world. Why should the Australian people who have to compete with the outside world in other industrial fields be obliged to continue from generation to generation to pay these high prices for boots? I hope that the Minister will not flinch from the very modest concession he has proposed to the Senate&#39;s request. Apparently, the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> is preparedto back up any kind of duty, no matter how high it may be. When the Senate proposes an increase of duty, he is prepared to support it despite the fact that this Committee fixed what it thought should be the duty after measured consideration. But if the measured consideration in another place is in the direction of reducing the proposed duty the honorable member claims we should not go back on the measured consideration of this Chamber, and he reflects upon the Minister if there is any attempt to do so. If, however, another place suggests an increase in the duty, the honorable member makes no reference whatever to the measured consideration of this Chamber, except to say that it was wrong. He is. utterly inconsistent. I hope that the Minister will adhere to his proposal. It is about time the boot industry commenced to relieve the public of some of the protection given to it during all these years of Federation. </para>

There are still some people in Australia who are so blind to the interests of their own country, and so unpatriotic as not to be able to wear an Australianmade article. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member suggests that I am also inconsistent, but&#39; there is no analogy between  12616 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> theboot industry and the corset industry. The former is an old-established industry capable of meeting the Australian demand, and to that extent is entitled to as much protection as possible. I do not deny that there was profiteering in the boot industry during the war, just as there was in other industries, but if the community is to be placed at the mercy of any section, importers or manufacturers, I prefer the latter.For every locally-made article that advanced tin price during the war the imported commodity advanced in price three times as much. Of course, there were obvious causes for this, such as scarcity of shipping and heavy insurance rates, but these causes will always prevail unless we establish and maintain industries by means of protective duties. </para>

            <para>- During the war the price of the usual class of boots worn by Australians was not increased by more than 40 per cent., or, perhaps, 50 per cent. On the other hand, a line of calico which was sold for 6d. per yard before the war, and which could be landed in Australia for 4d. or 4&#188;d. per yard, advanced in price so greatly during the war that the British cost was 2s. 3d. per yard. If we want the people of Australia to he at the mercyof such conditions whenever there is a dislocation of trade, let us remove the duties. .  Ihope that the Committee will maintain the higher rates on boots. The maintenance of the bootmaking industry guarantees to the primary producers fair prices for their hides, to the tanners fairprices for their leathers, and to the workers in the industry fair wages for their labour. </para>

          <para>.- I hope that the Committee will see its way clear to fall in with the views expressed by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> and allow the duties on boots to remain as agreed upon by this Chamber on a previous occasion. But the Minister, contrary to his utterances, has suggested a compromise with the Senate. However, I do not think we ought to make any compromise with the Senate. No evidence of consequence has been given to justify any diversion from our former decision to give a fair protection to this all-important industry, in which &#163;1,500,000 has been invested, and which distributes &#163;2,250,000 annually in wages to over 20,000 people, working in at least. 500 factories. There is not the slightest chance of the manufacturers taking any advantage of the high rates of duty to inflict high prices on consumers, because there is no other industry in Australia in which competition is so keen. It prevents exorbitant prices being charged. A reduction of 5 per cent. in the duty might make all the difference to those engaged in the boot factories, and if we interfere with the employment of so many people it may lead us into a disastrous position. My concern is not as to whether the average salaried man can pay a high price for imported boots. I am mainly interested in preventing our boot factories from closing and throwing men and women out of employment. The Minister says that he has given due consideration to the matter, and is anxious that the duties shall be retained as we agreed to them previously. I hope that the Committee will help him out of his awkward position, and inform the Senate that this all-important industry must have the full amount of protection given to it by this Chamber. </para>

          <para>. - Now that the Inter-State Commission no longer exists, I do not think it improper to refer to its fiscal predilections, and to mention that it had strong Free Trade leanings. That Commission, however, recognising that the boot industry, as the result of the trade depression between 1909 and 1913, was in a parlous state, practically listed it as the first to be  considered in connexion with, its Tariff inquiry in order that it might, at the earliest opportunity, make a recommendation to Parliament and so enable us to take action to restore it to its former flourishing condition. After a searching and complete inquiry into the boot and leather industries, the Commission reported that the duties on boots should be increased to 35 per cent, under the British Tariff, and 40 ner cent, under the General Tariff. Those are striking figures. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. -Greene)</inline> will find that the duty on some of the raw material used in the boot trade is almost equivalent to that on the finished article. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but the lead given by the Minister has an important bearing on the decision of the Committee. Very often when the division bell rings those honorable members who have been temporarily absent, and have not heard the discussion, come in and are guided in determining how to vote by noting the side on which the honorable gentleman is sitting. If those who were absent when the Minister submitted the proposal had heard the doubts expressed by him as to whether he was doing right in proposing to reduce by 5 per cent, the duty as originally passed by this Committee, I think they would decide to reject his motion, and to allow the item to remain as sent by us to the Senate. I am afraid this reduction will do great injury to the boot trade. </para>

            <para>- The figures as to the capital involved in, and the  wage3  paid by, this industry are very large. I propose to use these figures sparingly, but with the object of impressing the Minister and, perhaps, thoughtful members of the Committee with the importance of the trade. So far as my information goes, the wages paid by it amount to from &#163;2,250,000 to &#163;2,500,000 per annum, and the value of its output last year was over &#163;10,000,000. I am not very old in the political or economic life of this country, but I remember when, in my younger days, it was thought impossible to make high-grade boots in Australia. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. I have read a portion of the debate - if it may be so dignified - that took place on this item in another place, and I say advisedly that the Senate was stampeded by false statements - in the main, not wilfully false, but erroneous, information - into asking for a reduction of these duties. One honorable gentleman, whose name I think it would be improper to mention, made an attack upon the  boot  trade for profiteering during the war period. The argument was very like one that we heard in this chamber yesterday. Because prices had risen, if was assumed that profiteering was the cause of the rise. The Commonwealth Government Statist gives us interesting, figures as to the relative proportions of profit in a great number of .trades during the war time. I have here an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Production Bulletin</inline> issued annually by the Federal Statistician, which comprises all the industries making clothing of all kinds worn by men, women, and children. It includes those engaged in the manufacture of underclothing, hats and caps, shirts and ties, woollens, hosiery, all kinds of clothing, and boots and shoes, as well as certain textile fabrics not for wear, but for the protection of the human body, such, for instance, as blankets. Broadly speaking, throughout the whole of the textile trade in this group, eliminating boots and shoes, these were the percentages of profits, or, as it is termed, the &#34;percentage advance on cost&#34; - In 1911, 22.786 per cent, was registered by them; in 1912, 22.694; 1913, 22.395; 1914, 22.944- </para>

Before the war the average percentage -advance on cost in these trades was 22 per cent., whereas during the war the average of the recorded results obtainable was 24 per cent. The boot trade shows a striking dissimilarity. In the boot trade itself the percentage rate of gross profit on cost was as follows:- In 1911, 14.357; 1912, 14.722; 1913, 15.641; 1914, 14.472; 1915, 15.225; 1916, 14.344; 1917, 14.631; 1918, 15.971; 1919, 14.042; 1920, 14.751.

            <para>- Very little. It appears to me that in respect of a trade that involves considerable skill, much competition, and very considerable risk, this is a very low gross profit. The vital point, however, is that the profit did not vary. It did not climb steeply, as did the profits in many other trades during the war. The argument used in the Senate in favour of a reduction of the duties was that the boot manufacturers had profiteered at the expense of the consuming community. These figures, which are official, are a flat and irrefutable contradiction of the statement. I will leave it at that. </para>

The wages paid and the material used are taken, and the calculation is on the output - on the turnover not the capital employed.

            <para>- It was; but a number of importations took place. Under that Tariff, in the year 1914, &#163;672,000 worth of boots and shoes was imported. That was the last year in which competition from abroad, could be regarded as effective - it was before the war had laid its heavy hand on the Old Country. The decline in certain classes of importations was clearly not due to the duty, but to the fact that the war made it impossible for manufacturers in Britain to supply their customers in the Dominions. I should say that a 35 per cent, duty would be more effective under those conditions than it would be to-day. We shall have to discuss another item shortly, that of cartridges, to which prohibition extended, in this case not prohibition, but restriction, vastly minimized the possibilities of competition from Britain. </para>

            <para>- If the Board materializes and gets to work I expect it to analyze some of the basic industries, which reasonably rely on the operation of the Tariff. For example, if I may allude to this in passing, I am doubtful whether we have done the Tight thing in all directions to make quite sure that the basic steel industry is firmly rooted in the country. Then I look to the Board to examine and report regarding woollen and textile industries, and the superphosphate trade, to which the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill)</inline> so forcibly drew attention, and may do so again. We wish to know exactly the incidence of the duties, and the percentage of profits made by all who handle the commodities, in order that we may see whether the consumer is asked to &#34; pay too much for his whistle,&#34; More since than before the war, I believe in diversifying and ramifying our industries, but we must consider not only the operatives and the capitalists, but those who consume the protected goods here. I am hopeful that if we vote for this high duty,-&#34; because it is high, the Tariff Board will be able to report as to whether it is effective or unnecessarily high, and if it is shown to be unnecessarily high, I shall not hesitate for a momentto urge and vote for a reduction. I ask the Minister to consider, and not press too hard for his compromise arrangement, hut to reject the Senate&#39;s request, and send the duties back in their original form. I feel sure that when the members of another place are able to ascertain the facts as to &#34; profiteering,&#34; which so profoundly and suddenly influenced their judgment, they will give the newer figures the attention I think they deserve. </para>

          <para>.- I had not intended to speak, but I think it just as well to say a few words in reply to the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and I do so in the interest of the large body he mentioned - the consumers. Ever since the Tariff has been under consideration it has been impressed upon us that the object of the proposed duties is to promote industries in this country, and that when the industries grow up and become strong, it will be possible to remove the duties, and that, owing to organization and greater output, we shall then be able to procure cheaper commodities. But the Tariff introduced on the present occasion means a big increase in duties. . The honorable member for Balaclava quoted figures, which are really not war-period figures, in regard to profits. </para>

            <para>- I think the manufacturers are like other men in business, who have their Combines, and fix their prices. I understand that boots which are supplied by the manufacturer at 13s. to 15s. per pair, are sold to the consumer, in the retail places, at from 27s. 6d. to 35s. That is what I have been given to understand takes place, and I do not think it exaggerates the position. I believe the profits in the retail shops are abnormal, and probably give rise to the complaints about the cost of these articles. This is an industry which, from its inception, has received high protection in Victoria. The honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> was Minister for Customs in the Victorian Parliament, and I suppose it is thirty years ago since he introduced a Tariff, including duties up to 40 per cent. on boots. That honorable member tells us to-day that the Victorian manufacturers are now importing the very best up-to-date machinery for the purposes of their trade. My contention is that in an industry which has been fostered for so long, up-to-date machinery should have been there from ten to twenty years ago. </para>

            <para>- Then, let us say that the Australian boots cost &#163;1 to manufacture; a Canadian or American manufacturer would have to turn them out at 8s., and, with an exchange of &#163;17 to &#163;20 against us, and freight and other charges to pay, we have anenormous natural protection.

          <para>.- The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> told us that we were going back to a pre-war Tariff. I draw the honorable member&#39;s attention to the fact that we have already gone back to prewar prices for the raw product. To-day, and for some time past, the price of hides has been lower than the pre-war price. The honorable member admits that the Tariff is high, and then endeavours to prove that there was no profiteering in the boot trade during the war period. During the war our boot manufacturers bought the hides that they used at a fixed price, which was considerably lower than was paid for hides elsewhere, just as our cloth manufacturers got their wool more cheaply than the rest of the world. That makes the figures that have been quoted valueless. Although the price of hides was fixed, the price of boots rose, and, notwithstanding the protection which our factories have received for so many years-, there are more children going bare-footed to school to-day than did so ten or twenty years ago. That is due to the fact that the price of&#39; primary products has fallen, and that the price ofboots has risen. Today many a man who sells hides sees his children going bare-footed to school, because he cannot afford to buy boots for them. </para>

            <para>- But many children have to travel bare-footed over rough roads because their parents cannot afford to buy boots for them. This being so, it would be absurd for Parliament to take action to make boots still dearer. The Senate has taken a proper view. It has regarded the interests of Australia as a. whole, and has not allowed itself to be swayed by the over-pressure of the cities. I am glad to think that the Minister may accept the Senate&#39;s request. Even the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best)</inline> must admit that we should not do anything to increase the price of footwear when men who are producing hides cannot afford to buy boots for their children. </para>

          <para>. - I am disappointed at the Minister who proposes to recede from the position originally taken up by this Committee. We have been told about the high price of boots in Australia during the war, but is it not a fact that at that time boots were very dear everywhere, the reason being that there was profiteering? The profits, however, did not go wholly to the manufacturers. Both manufacturers and retailers got a fair share of them, and those who sold raw material to the manufacturers also did well. There is a duty of 25 per cent. on leather. Most of our leather comes from a foreign country, while the importation of goods is chiefly from Great Britain. </para>

            <para>- Furthermore the cost of trimmings has increased enormously. It has been said that our boot manufacturers should install up-to-date machinery. They have done that as much as they can. One machine that they use is employed to stitch welts. Prior to the war, British machines for doing that work could be bought, and an American machine could be leased, but during the war there was a combination of the interests under the Stars and Stripes with those under the Union Jack, and a British-American Company was formed, which took over all the welt stitching machines in Australia. - There were some German machines on the market, and these the new company bought up and scrapped. Consequently, to-day our boot manufacturers are at its mercy. They have to pay a high rental for these machines, and, in addition, so much per stitch, a charge which is made by meter, as gas is charged for, and, like the gas meters, these machine meters rob the users of the machines. We should say to the American and British bounders who are treating our manufacturers in this way that if they will not act more fairly we shall allow their machines to be made in Australia without payment of royalty. The Americans have done that sort of thing. If we made these machines dutiable, the company that owns them would increase their rental and their price per stitch. </para>

        <para class="block">We could, however, say to the representatives of the company, which is known as the British Boot Company, it being thought that the Union Jack would hide the Stars and Stripes, &#34; You must deal less harshly with our manufacturers.&#34; The present arrangement is a handicap on boot making here. Our manufacturers have to crawl on their stomachs to the representatives of this company, but if these bounders will tax our people unfairly &#39; we should allow their machines to be made here without royalty. A man who wishes to start a boot factory has to approach the representatives of the company cap-in-hand, and. to put up with their robbery. Our boot trade has been built up under Protection, but why should the industry be made a scapegoat because there has been profiteering ? This community has paid more for wheat than it should have paid. </para>

            <para>-We are not doing so now, and have not done so for some time. But, should we, because we have been robbed in regard to the price of our bread, discontinue the use of Australian wheat? Of course, not. That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. When we were dealing with the timber industry there was an attempt to make it a scapegoat, because timber has been so expensive. This is not a fair way to treat our protected industries. </para>

            <para>- What I say is that we should keep the manufacture of boots within Australia. Every Australian should assist us in doing that. I hope that we may be able to defeat the Minister&#39;s proposal. When the Tariff Board gets to work - perhaps I should underline the word &#34; when &#34; - many of the complaints that have been made will be removed, but we should not increase the importation of boots&#39; by reducing the duty. The proposal of the Minister might, if agreed to, increase the revenue to be handled by the next Treasurer, but it would certainly injure our boot trade, and we should not allow that to be injured. </para>

In opposition to my advice, the Committee imposed a duty of &#163;3 on newsprint. I do not propose to go over the whole ground again. The reasons which led me to recommend a duty of &#163;2 remain. I simply recall to the recollection of the Committee the reasons why the Government considered that a &#163;2 preference to Great Britain on newsprint was, in the circumstances, sufficient. The Senate has now requested this Committee to agree to that duty of &#163;2, and the Government feel that they must adhere to the position that they originally adopted. I move, therefore - </para>

          <para>.- ThisCommittee decided, by a very substantial majority, to impose a duty of &#163;3 per ton on newsprint; and it does appear strange that the Government, instead of accepting that decision, evidently induced another place to re-insert the duty which this Committee had rejected. That procedure is not proper. This Committee having deliberately come to a decision, it is not for the Government to induce another place to undo what we did here. Under the circumstances, I expect honorable members who previously considered a duty of &#163;3 necessary to stand by their former decision. </para>

          <para>. - The original decision of this Committee was that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates of 5 per oent. , 10 per cent., and 15 per cent. should be imposed. If they are to be done away with, and those papers are to be admitted from. Britain free, the intermediate and general rates being &#163;2 per ton, or even &#163;3 per ton, as the Minister now proposes, the resultwill be the collection of considerably less duty. I ask the Committee to disagree both with the request of the Senate and with the Minister&#39;s proposed modification. The sub-item deals with a. class of paper which  is  manufactured in Australia. The whole of our requirements can be locally supplied. The trouble is that we have newspapers which preach Protection for every other section in the community but desire the benefits of Free Trade for themselves. I do not propose to help them in that direction. Can the Minister indicate the approximate difference in the amount of duty likely to be collected under the rates which he has just moved as compared with the imposition of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates respectively of 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 15 per cent.? </para>

          <para>.- I cannot understand why British paper supplies should be admitted free. The paper dealt with in this sub-item is far different from newsprint. Surely some small amount of local Protection might be afforded, even if the rate against British manufacturers were made as low as 5 per cent. Where is the necessity for departing from the original decision of the Committee? If the whole question is to be reviewed in the light of undoubted evidence which has been furnished to honorable members, I think the majority will say that the time is opportune for imposing increased, rather than reduced, duties.. </para>

            <para>- I am not prepared to go into details at this stage. Paper mills of the Commonwealth are required to compete with all-comers. Only a little while ago, a certain Government Department invited tenders for supplies of these lines of paper. The successful tenderer was a manufacturing firm outside of the Commonwealth, and its quotation was about &#163;26,000. It is ordinarily good business to deal in the cheapest market for one&#39;s supplies; but, seeing that this was a Government tender, consideration might have been given to a local industry&#39;, employing local labour. It would have been wiser, for the sake of about &#163;2,000, to accept the Australian tender.  The  relatively slight increase in cost would have been distributed among Australian taxpayers. Does the Minister know anything of this industry? Is he alive to the, necessity for affording it adequate protection?  12626 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff</inline> &#91;REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline></para>

          <para>.- The duties of 12s., 13s., and 14s. per cwt. are ample, so far as certain classes of bags are concerned, but are not nearly sufficient in respect of other bags, which are very much smaller. The work involved in making these very small bags, as compared with the &#39;large ones, is much greater. They are made of very light paper, and an enormous number of them go to the cwt. Having looked into the proposal, I think it is necessary to have these alternative duties to protect that part of the bag-making industry to which I have referred. I therefore move - </para>

          <para>.- The Senate has requested us to make this subitem dealing with chassis, unassembled, free of duty. When the item was before us on the last occasion, I compromised with the Committee by accepting a lower rate of duty than was originally proposed. There can be no question that many of these chassis are used all over the country for utilitarian purposes, while at the same time, many of them are brought in purely for pleasure, and are luxuries in the true sense of theword.It is impossible to discriminate between the one and the other, butthe Government feel that, in the existing circumstances, it cannot give up entirely, as suggested by the &#39; Senate, the whole of the revenue received under this sub-item. Much as we should like, from some points of view, to free this item entirely from duty, we feel that we would not be justified, at the present time, in doing so. I therefore move - </para>

          <para>.  - I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> will agree to accept the Senate&#39;s request. We have been told throughout the Tariff debate that anything that cannot be manufactured here should be allowed to come in free of duty. The Minister admits that this duty on chassis is really for revenue purposes. Many chassis, as he says, are used for utilitarian purposes, while many are used only for pleasure. We are glad to know that motor transport is much more popular than it was a few years ago, and that various firms that are using motor cars in their business find that they are time and money savers. Even chassis that are brought in entirely for pleasure or for hire have an important bearing on Australian industry.  I  invite the high Tariffists of the Committee to recognise that by the free admission of chassis unassembled we shall find more employment for our people. In the first place, this proposal will enable the manufacturers of British chassis to compete with other manufacturers in theAustralian market. That is a point of which we ought not to lose sight. I do not think that these small duties would yield sufficient revenue to recompense the Department for the work involved in collecting them, while there can be no doubt that they would be an annoyance to many firms. If chassis unassembled were admitted free, spring-makers and other iron workers would soon be making springs and other parts for chassis. It would give them an opportunity to develop their industry and would provide more employment in Australia. The importation of chassis free would lead to the more extensive use of motor vehicles. It is a moot point in some States whether motor transport is  not  cheaper than horse or steam transport.  A  large firm in Perth adopted motor transport, but have found that for heavy work it is more advantageous for them, in view of the high price of petrol at the present time, to use steam or horses. This is one of the largest firms of its kind in  the  Commonwealth - I am not going to give them any advertisement - and at the present time they are thinking of reverting to the old method of transport. It is  not  desirable that they should do so.  The  importation of chassis free would be a great incentive to the manufacture in Australia of portions of them, and <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> would lead to the greater use of cars for luxury. If a man buys a motor car, and uses it for pleasure alone, and in the use of it employs labour to the extent  of  a chauffeur and repairers, he is doing good to Australia. I would rather see a man spend his money in that way than hoard it. There is another aspect of this question that I want to put before the Committee. Motor tyres of every description, and of high quality, are being made in Australia to-day. If unassembled chassis are admitted to Australia free of duty and are obtainable at low prices, work will be provided for Australians in assembling them, body builders will be given an opportunity of showing their ability, and the tyre industry will receive a great impetus. I would like the Minister to reconsider the position and accept the amendment. The revenue Tariff that the Committee has put on to-night in connexion with the timber industry will provide enough revenue for a considerable time, and there is no need for a further revenue Tariff on chassis. I am not going to take this proposal sitting down when I know that it means so much to an Australian industry which I want to see prosper, and which will prosper if we allow chassis to come in free. A Tariff such as is proposed will be an incubus on the Department in bookkeeping, and an annoyance to the people who have to deal with the Department, while the revenue derived from it will be negligible: to the Government. The freedom from duty will mean much, however, to those people who have a laudable desire to build up an important Australian industry. </para>

I went into every factory in Perth to get a tractor, but I could not get one, but had to take a Jelbart tractor all the way from Ballarat. This tractor beat every other tractor, including three American and three other Australian makes, in the Government tests at Werribee Research Farm. I have seen an imported tractor, owned by the Western Australian Government, that clears land and removes heavy timber. That was driven by steam, and did its work very well. Revenue is needed badly, goodness knows, and I intend to support the motion. </para>

            <para>-  I am paying more than my share of income tax now. I am unjustly paying it because of the inequitable system that Parliament has enacted. I hope the system will not be perpetuated. The Minister has admitted that the duty onchassis is not intended for protective purposes, but for the production of revenue.In the face of such a declaration no honorable member can contend that a duty is necessary for the development of the industry. To get these chassis cheaper will develop a very important industry in Australia. It is not desirable that the people who purchase these should be loaded with an addition of &#163;10, &#163;20, or &#163;30 to the price. Why should the Committee wilfullyhamper industrial development in Australia by seizing this amount from the man who purchases an imported vehicle, possibly with the object of arranging conveniences to develop portions of Australia? It is a short-sighted policy, and cannot be regarded as otherwise. Revenue is needed.No one knows that better than I. I know that our liabilities have got to be met, and I think that the best way to meet them is to unshackle the people who are producing the money. I cannot see that it is any advantage to take money out of their pockets which will retard their progress. Surely we ought to give them a start, and afterwards tax them on the money they raise. The proposal now before the Committee will tend to prevent them from raising the money by compelling them to work with antiquated methods and to take hours to do what might be done in minutes. I hope the Minister will consent to the wellconsidered request from the Senate. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to support the request of the Senate. I have consistently opposed and will continue to oppose, a Tariff purely for revenue purposes. The Minister for Trade and&#39; Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has said that of the machines imported it is difficult to determine which of them will be used for pleasure and which for trade, and that, therefore, they must all pay the penalty. If there is one thing that is making life a  little more pleasant to those who are pioneering the  outback  parts of Australia it is the motor car. It is a means of quick transit, which they can get in no other way. It is often a matter of life and death in the out-back parts of Australia to get quickly into communication with medical assistance. If a person is injured - a workman or a member of the family - in the absence of a motor car he may have to be drawn along a rough road or taken to hospital, or other medical aid, by means or a horse, trap, or waggonette. In such cases considerations of humanity demand that everything possible should be done to provide quick means of transit. The motor car is a very useful aid in fighting bush fires, such as those which have broken out in the western parts of New South &#34;Wales. If large numbers of settlers, owing to the motor cars being &#163;30 or &#163;40 cheaper, are able to possess them, they can mobilize their fighting forces more effectively to cope with the disaster. They can run their gangs&#39; of fighters from, one point to another quickly. </para>

            <para>- It certainly does apply to agricultural machinery, * hut where the honorable member for Barrier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Considine)</inline> makes a mistake is in not recognising that farming implements are manufactured in this country, and that motor-car chassis are not. If people with money would sink their capital in the industry and manufacture chassis in Australia, I would stand up for a duty, but until then I will not do so. If chassis were being manufactured in Australia the duty in operation would not be sufficient. The Minister admits that it is only a revenue duty, and it is an unfair one. It is all very well to apply the Minister&#39;s argument to a man living in one of the capital cities, who uses his motor car for pleasure rides on nice roads, but if it is impossible to discriminate, as the Minister has said, be tween that man and the settler outback, it is infinitely better to allow the man in the city to get his chassis free than to tax the man outback. The man who uses a motor car for pleasure creates employment, to some extent, and he can be taxed in another way without penalizing people to whom a motor&#39;car is an sibsolute necessity. Lately, a Royal Commission, in its report, deplored the fact that people were leaving the country for the cities ; and we all know the disastrous effects that such movements have on  civilization throughout the world. If we wish to encourage people to pioneer the country, we should see that they are supplied with the proper conveniences and comforts of life. I should like to see motor cars so cheap that almost everybody could possess one. I cannot support this duty, if only for the reason that it is a revenue one, and I regard the obtaining of revenue through the Customs as the worst possible system. I hope tha Committee will accede to the Senate&#39;s request, and make chassis free. </para>

          <para>.- I should like some information as to what is covered by &#34; chassis.&#34; An additional sub-item* has been inserted dealing with tractors and traction engines, which I regard as analogous in practically every respect to chassis with petrol engines, there being no difference, except a slight addition to the bodies on the top. These vehicles are being used, and would be still more largely used, if available, in,connexion with the harvesting of our present season&#39;s wheat, but for many months it has been impossible to secure a definition of what is covered by the sub-item, with, the result that many tractors are still in bond because purchasers are afraid of the uncertainty about the ultimate! cost. My suggestion is that there is really no difference between chassis and the various oil and petrol driven tractors&#39; utilized for various purposes; and there ought to be a definition so as to remove the uncertainty of which I have spoken.. As to the item itself, I think that,  in  regard to chassis, preference ought to be given to Great Britain. During the war, and for. a time after, owing to the fact that motor manufacturers at Home were busily engaged in munition making, manufacturers of other countries were able to obtain the control of the Australian market. Britain has now  developed a class of motor which is on all fours with the American light vehicles, and the introduction of the former to Australia ought to be encouraged by means of some preference. I should like to see discrimination shown in favour of Great Britain as against American and other outsidechassis. </para>

            <para>- There is also a suggestion to make these chassis free from all sources, but I am not in favour of treating all alike. Motors are now an absolute necessity throughout Australia; but I realize that revenue has to be obtained from somewhere, and I am afraid that the Customs revenue will not be what is expected at the end of the year. For this reason, I shall support a duty. </para>

            <para>- I do not mind a small duty on the American car, but I wish commodities that are not made in this country tot be as cheap as possible. Figures which I have quoted on a previous occasion show that there are 500,000 used cars in Canada as against 65,000 in Australia. If we possessed motor cars in the same proportion as Canada, much employment would be provided in bodybuilding and so forth. Bodies are being built here now ; indeed, from what I have heard, I believe they are being exported to Singapore, and, probably, to the Old Country. If, by cheapening the cost, we can increase the manufacture of cars, we should, by the growing industry created, add largely to the wealth of this country. </para>

            <para>- I do not object to a small duty as against other countries; but chassis ought to be free from England. If the Minister will not accept my suggestion, he might agree to the request for higher British preference. Chassis are of great importance in connexion with our country railway services. At the present time, in Victoria,. South Australia, Western Australia, and elsewhere, it is absolutely impossible to run ordinary locomotives and trains to the numerous small settlements. Such train services, where provided, may be only once a week; but with chassis and light oil cars, trains to to carry from twenty to thirty passengers, with mails and small parcels, might be run two or three times a week, or even, in cases, several timesa day. </para>

            <para>- Yes; and nowhere else. The motor is of great use in opening up the country, and many mail services are thus conducted in the north-west and other parts of Western Australia, with inestimable advantage. , The Minister need not be afraid for his revenue, in view of the additions made to it by some of the decisions arrived at this afternoon. If the Minister fears that my suggestion might mean high-priced cars coming in free, then it might be provided that such cars shall pay duty; while those required for developmental purposes shall not. </para>

          <para>. - This particular item was dealt withby the Committee when I happened tobe absent through illness. The Committee decided to reduce the duties as originally submitted by me. The Senate requests that the duties as originally submitted shall be restored, and I intend, therefore, to move that the requested amendments be made. I do not know of any industry that is of greater value, or one in which there are possibilities of greater extension, than the piano industry.We are not making anything like the number of pianos we should make in Australia. I am satisfied that if the duties requested by the Senate are imposed, it will not be very long before we have several additional piano-making establishments in the Commonwealth, and we shall be making the greater number of the pianos used in this country. This is one of the instances in which, in some regards, I did not originally propose duties as high as those suggested as desirable in the circumstances by the Inter-State Commission. There are very few industries which employ labour to a greater extent than does the piano industry. </para>

            <para>- I am confident that these duties will lead to the establishment of the industry in Australia on a larger scale than at present. That will give rise to internal competition, which, in cases of this sort, is very desirable. This is one of the finest industries we can have,  and it will give employment to a vast number of people. There is scarcely any part of a piano the raw material for which is not found in this country.  The piano-making industry is peculiarly one which provides a means for using raw materials which we possess in abundance. For the reasons I have given, I hope the Committee will accept the duties originally submitted by me, and will agree to the request made by the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I have consistently supported higher duties in order to assist in the establishment of Australian industries, but on this item I intend to deliberately absent myself from the division as a mark of my disgust and disapproval. There are certain features &#39;connected with the consideration of the item now under discussion which I deprecate very strongly, and which I take advantage of this opportunity to mention. During the consideration of the Tariff we have been receiving sheaves of literature and volumes of printed matter arguing the pros and cons in support of and against the duties proposed on almost every item. In connexion with this item honorable members have received a booklet dealing with pianos and piano players. It is printed by Shepherd and Newman, of Sydney, and the name of Messrs. Beale and  Company,  piano makers, of Australia, is associated with it. In the pamphlet I find that, unfortunately, those responsible for its publication have endeavoured to secure an advantage by attempting to arouse racial&#39; and national feelings, and by appealing  to  the prejudice and passion of honorable members, instead of relying upon commonsense arguments in support of increased duties on pianos. This booklet represents a very unworthy form of propaganda. </para>

            <para>- It is  very  unworthy on the part of those responsible for it, arid as a member who desires to advance the claims of Parliament for universal respect by high standards of conduct, I certainly will not permit such a circumstance as this to pass without an expression of my distinct disapproval. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a member of the Committee, I strongly object to those who appeal for the support of honorable members for their proposals resorting to such unfair and unworthy practices as are adopted in the publication of this pamphlet. The supporters of Australian industries have no need to resort to the despicable tactics adopted by the persons responsible for this publication. When the support of honorable members is sought by references to atrocities which took place during the war, it is time that the people responsible for this kind of propaganda were warned that in future honorable members will not recognise literature of this description. The best place for it is the wastepaper basket, to which I now propose to relegate it. </para>

          <para>.- I am very glad that the Government propose to accede to the request of the Senate to increase the duties .on pianos. I have some figures with me which I think may interest honorable members. &#34;In yesterday&#39;s newspaper I noticed that the German mark had depreciated to the extent of 1,000 marks to the sovereign. Before the war the sovereign represented but 20 marks. Prior to the war a really good piano could be bought in Berlin for &#163;20, giving a good profit to the manufacturer and also to the retailer. It is true that the cost of production in Germany has increased, but even allowing that it has increased by 400 per cent., and the increase has not been so much, that would make the cost of the piano &#163;100. With the mark at 1,000 to the &#163;1, &#163;20 would represent a pre-war buying capacity of &#163;1,000, and if we divide the &#163;100 into the &#163;1,000, we find that it is possible to obtain ten pianos to-day in Berlin at the cost of one prior to the war. What* chance would piano manufacturers in Australia have if German pianos were today admitted at the old rates of duty? Men who suffered imprisonment in Germany during the war, undergoing the vilest tortures, are at present employed in the Wertheim and Beale factories, and one of the Wertheims showed his love for Australia by risking <inline font-weight="bold">Ms life</inline> for it on active service.

This industry utilizes quantities of Australian material; iron and steal, copperwire, glue, casein, varnishes, polishes, paints, timbers, veneers, leather cloth, felt, nails, bolts, screws, brasswork, machinery of many kinds, and electrical apparatus, all of local production. It also assists the building trades, and is a consumer of locally generated power. Directly, and through its employees, it gives assistance to other industries. I am glad that the Government supports the higher rates, and I shall have pleasure in voting with the Minister. If the remarks credited to the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> who represented Australia at the Geneva Conference, be true, that in Germany all the people are industriously working, their factories not having been destroyed as were those of France and Belgium, Ihope that the measure commonly known as the Antidumping Bill will be proceeded with immediately, so that it may be used to prevent the dumping in this market of German pianos, of which ten can now be purchased for what was the price of one, because of the way in which the clever financial brains of Germany are using the rate of exchange to beat the world, which they were not able to conquer by force of arms. </para>

            <para>- Surely we ought not to impose a high duty merely to benefit one manufacturer. I hope that the Committee will leave the duty on keyboards at 20 per cent., 30 per cent., and 35 per cent. We should consider the interests of the people, not those of a particular manufacturer, and when a firm is making an article merely to benefit itself, that branch of its business should not be protected with huge duties. </para>

          <para>.- The intention of the amendment which the Senate asks us to make in this item is to prevent the protection of various kinds of sensitized material from falling below a certain point. The Senate asks us to agree to fixed rates, which have been adopted tentatively, on the understanding that they were higher than the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates agreed to by the Committee. It was stated by the Minister in charge of the Tariff there at the time that, if on further examination it were found that these rates were, in effect, higher than the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates at present market prices, steps would be taken to reduce them below those rates. The matter has been carefully investigated, and it is found that these duties as they, are framed are higher than the existing <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates at the present market prices; and it is, therefore, proposed to reduce the fixed rates, and otherwise to agree to the request of the Senate.

          <para>.- The Senate has requested that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty under the general Tariff be immediately made 30 per cent. Honorable members will notice that we proposed a deferred <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty to operate from 1st January, 1923, and I explained to the Committee at the time that it was desired that the manufacture of cartridges should be carried on to a greater extent&#34; than hitherto, and that the whole operation of manufacturing cartridges be undertaken. At presentwe are not doing that, and the intention of the deferred duty under the general Tariff was to enable manufacturers to carry out the whole of the work. It was my intention to move that the Senate&#39;s request in this particular instance be not agreed to; but it has been very forcibly represented to me by quite a number of honorable members that Great Britain should have some further preference. I move - </para>

        <para>Mr.FOLEY  (Western Australia) &#91;9.37&#93;. - When this item was previously before the Committee, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> had ample opportunities of obtaining the opinion of every one interested in this industry, and we came to a deliberate decision by a large majority to impose the duties shown in the Tariff as it left this Chamber. Personally, I would have preferred to have seen lower rates adopted, but when I found that a majority of honorable members were willing to accept a compromise, and that the Committee had decided that the rates suggested were fair on the evidence before us, I did not press the matter further. I asserted at the time that there was a factory, or, perhaps I should say, a building, on the Maribyrnong, known as Kynock&#39;s, in which it was alleged that cartridges were being made. But that factory has not turned out a completed cartridge before or since that date, neither has extra machinery been installed, nor additional employees engaged. Most of the operatives in that building are juveniles, who handle the component parts of cartridges imported from overseas, and which are merely passed in and out of a small machine. Perhaps the Bourke-street boundary riders and Bourke-street sportsmen do not realize that there are men who make their living by the rifle, and whose employment will be taken from them if unnecessarily high duties are imposed. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> should remember that there is no outback country in Victoria, and that this State is so small that it is only a hop, skip, and a jump from the sea to the River Murray. The honorable member should consider this and other questions from a broader stand-point. Notwithstanding the broad, national outlook of the honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton),</inline> he is evidently unaware that there are places in Australia where the kangaroo is a pest. In portions of Western Australia kangaroos are protected; but in other portions they are not, because they are regarded as a menace. If the necessity for getting rid of the pest be admitted, honorable members must also recognise the necessity for letting the kangaroo shooter get his cartridges at a fair rate. Those articles are not manufactured in Australia. Not a tittle of additional evidence has been advanced since the Committee previously came to a decision upon this item; and, in the language of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Best),</inline> the Government&#39;s attitude towards the request appears to &#39;be dictated solely by a desire to placate the Senate. In adopting that course, they are doing incalculable harm to those menwho have to buy cartridges in order to earn a living. It cannot be shown that since the Committee previously dealt with the item one additional man is &#39;being employed, or one additional machine has been installed, in the cartridge factory. As the cartridges are not being produced in Australia, and they can be imported from a country in which the conditions of labour are as good as those in Australia, it is the duty of the Committee to provide people in the backblocks with the opportunity of combating the kangaroo pest as cheaply as possible. It has bean argued that the Senate has not proposed any alteration of the British and intermediate Tariffs; but it has altered the general Tariff, and that is the only one that counts. </para>

On that occasion I opposed any increase of the duty on explosives, and explained that the reason why the Government proposed a deferred duty was that we had reason to believe that in the near future modern explosives works would be erected in this country, which, in time of war, would be of great assistance to the Commonwealth. We discovered before the Tariff left this Chamber that there was no immediate probability of those works being proceeded with.

          <para>. - I was sorry to hear the Minister&#39;s proposal, and I trust that it will not be indorsed by the Committee. Some divisions have gone against the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to-day, not altogether to his displeasure, and I trust that if the Committee decide against him in regard to this item also he will not be displeased. I am the proud possessor of a certificate from the Rotherham testing station in England. I understand that if the Department has not a copy of the certificate in its posses&#34;sion it has been advised by cable of its contents. This certificate, which is signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Major A.</inline> Cooper Key, Chief Inspector of Explosives in Great Britain, sets out the contents of explosive A2 Monobel and Viking powder No. 2, and proves that in quality they are equal to any explosives imported. It is the opinion of explosive experts in Australia that an explosive made locally, under exactly the same conditions as prevail in other parts of the world, except, of course. &#39; labour conditions, and transported, say, to Newcastle, is in better and safer condition for use than is an explosive imported from overseas. Before I conclude I intend to submit a proposition which I believe even the Government will accept, and those who bitterly opposed the granting of a small measure of protection to this key industry will assent to. I am not in any sense favorable to a monopoly in respect of explosives or any other </para>

            <para>- I am indicating the principal- sources of the supply of explosives. A complaint was made recently that some explosives used in one of the coal mines in New South Wales were defective, but I understand the reason for the slight defect that was discovered was that the explosives had not been kept quite dry. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> seems to hope that in a few months&#39; time an industry will blossom out sufficiently large to satisfy him that a great key industry has been established. During the war there was a considerable expenditure for the establishment of an explosives factory at Deer Park. That project is not dead ; but, if the industry is to be established on a giant scale, i am inclined to think it will not be in the constituency of Maribyrnong, but on a site at Port Kembla, in the district of the honorable member for Illawarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hector</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Lamond), because some of the raw material required for the manufacture of explosives is to be found there. I do not say that I have received information on this matter from an official source absolutely, but I have it from a reliable quarter. So in a couple of years it is probable that the industry being established in Maribyrnong will be removed to a place where a large number of industries are making headway. I do not intend to enter into a criticism of Nobel&#39;s works, which, I believe, employ coloured labour in South Africa, but I want our white people, both men and women, to be free from competition with underpaid coloured labour in other parts of the world. The minimum wage paid to adult workers in  the  Australian explosives factory is &#163;4 9s. per week, as against &#163;1 paid for similar work done bycoloured labour in South Africa. The coal costs &#163;2 7s. 3d. per ton delivered in the Australian factory, whereas the coal used in the South African factory costs less than 15s. per ton. As it takes2&#188; tons of coal to produce 1 ton. of explosives, it will be seen that the expenditure on this item alone is very large. We have had a protective duty upon the raw material used in the manufacture of the finished article, and I  say,  without fear of successful contradiction, that the duty imposed on the raw material is a higher measure of protection than the Minister proposes to afford to the industry. The duty on the raw material goes up to 2s. 5d. per case of gelatine explosives, and 5s. 6d. per case of coal explosives. If these statements are correct, there must be some very strong reason, that has not been stated to the Committee,  Why  the Minister does not give greater protection to this industry. If all the facts in connexion with the manufacture of explosives were known to the coal miners, I believe they would gladly pay an increased price for explosives known to have been manufactured  by  white labour. I have  no  prejudice against the coloured people. It  is  my good fortune  to  belong  to  the white race, and when  it is  a matter of competition between well-paid white labour and low-paid coloured labour, my vote as a labour man must always  go in  favour  of  the white people who are receiving the higher wage. It has been argued that duties should not be levied  on  imports  of  explosives because the coal miners  pay for the explosives which they use. Blacksmiths and farriers pay for the iron and steel which they use, .but I have not heard it argued that for that reason a duty should be levied on imports of iron and steel. Nobel&#39;s Company, of which the factory in the Maribyrnong electorate is supposed to be an offshoot, i3 criticised, by those who are opposed to this measure of protection, as a Combine. The company is said to constitute a great evil in the Old Country. I shall read the following portion of the agreement made with the company, as outlined on page 8 of the report of the Committee which inquired into the matter in Great Britain : - </para>

It is quite true that prices in the United Kingdom are higher than in Australia. That is chiefly due to the fact that the explosives factories in the United Kingdam have been demobilizing very gradually a huge army of munition workers. It would have been inhuman treatment to have turned those surplus employees into the streets immediately the war was over. The explosives companies did not do so, and the cost of gradual  demobilization  has been a heavy charge oh the explosives industry. I think that credit is reflected on Nobel&#39;s works by the fact that it did not dispense with the services of the men in its employ. It wa3 one of the great sheet- &#171; anchors of the British Government in the conduct of the war. The whole of its great factory, with its fine army of chemists, was placed at the disposal of the British authorities, and sterling service was rendered during the most critical period. The employees who remained in those works, and those who enlisted, gave magnificent service at that particular time. The factory, which employs white labour in Australia, does not look for a greater profit than 6 per cent, on the capital invested. The following  coalmines  throughout Australasia have been using the products of this particular factory - </para>

          <para>- Yes, a short time ago, when after using Viking for three years one concern complained it had not exploded as well as usual. But I am informed on very good authority that this was due to the fact that it had been allowed to get damp. Great care must be taken to prevent explosives of any description from getting damp, otherwise they become defective. Fifteen returned soldiers who, after serving in the great war, have been re-employed by the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company, at Deer Park, have signed the following letter, dated the 28th October, 1921, which has been forwarded to honorable members: - </para>

          <para>We, the undersigned returned soldiers in the employ of the above company, desire to bring under <inline font-style="italic">your notice</inline> that things are most unsatisfactory in our industry, owing to the uncertainty in regard to the Tariff question. Having taken a keen interest in the debate and vote of the House of Representatives on this subject, also therequest for further consideration by the Senate in the protection of our industry, we urge upon you the necessity of recording your vote in favour of the Senate&#39;s request for a duty that will keep our industry going, and keep us in employment. We respectfully draw your attention to the fact that this is the only industry completely neglected by the Government in its Tariff proposals. If you cannot give this request in full, there is an alternative in the way of granting a bonus.Failing this, we will have to ask you to use your influence in finding us work in some other direction through the Repatriation Department. </para>

        <para class="block">I have a proposition which I hope will be accepted by the Committee, and that is to insert the words &#34; wholly or partly the product of coloured labour&#34; in the Senate&#39;s requested amendment. It may be thought that the duty that the Senate has requested us to propose is high, but we must remember that a duty has also been imposed on much of the raw material needed. in the manufacture of explosives, and it has been the Minister&#39;s practice when dealing with items in the schedule to impose a slightly higher protection on the finished article if duties have been placed on the raw material from which the article is manufactured. All that I now ask is that the white worker who is engaged in this industry, and paid an average wage of &#163;4 9s. per week, shall be protected from coloured labour engaged in a similar industry in other parts of the world at the low wage of &#163;1 per week. If Nobel&#39;s, Dupont, and De Beers can by employing white labour manufacture an explosive in any part of the world and send it out to Australia, let them do it, but it is a fair proposal to protect our white workers against the unfair competition of coloured labour. Honorable members may point out the difficulty of carrying out my suggestion, but in the case of rum the sehedule provides the following: - </para>

            <para>- I have not said so, but the honorable member for Maribyrnong, who gave a list of all the other collieries where it was used, was careful not to mention the fact that the Australian explosive was used at the Mount Mulligan mine. The Inter-State Commission which investigated this subject found that the people manufacturing explosives at Deer Park were really part of the Combine which, operating in Great Britain, in amalgamation with makers , in other countries, increased the price of explosives used in Australia to three times their pre-war value, and then, in order to get complete hold of the market, established a small concern in Victoria. This they thought would enable them to claim protection, with a view to getting their explosives into use ahead of another company which had come into the field&#39; and reduced the price, and, in fact, kept it down during the whole period of the war. No one knows what the miners might have had to pay for their explosives during that period had it not been for this competition. This was a South African company, and apparently it is now to be put off the market in the interests of a company that has established itself, in Australia, as an offshoot of a Combine that exploited the people of this and other countries during the war. </para>

            <para>- I am not saying it is not. I am only arguing that the miners of the Commonwealth should get a fair deal in regard to explosives. I have been discussing the question of safety in coal mines for a great number of years. 1 know, from a lifelong experience, the dangers to be encountered in our coal mines. Reference has been made to the Mount Mulligan disaster. I have not the slightest doubt that it was the result of a blown-out shot igniting the dust. Nothing should be left undone to protect the men who are employed in our mines. When last this item was under discussion it was suggested that the men employed at Wonthaggi also showed a preference for the locally manufactured explosives. I have here a letter from the secretary of the local organization to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis,</inline> stating that they used more &#34; Cape &#34; explosives in the Wonthaggi mine than any other explosive.

          <para>- No. They are more concerned with the effectiveness of an explosive than its cost. What is the use of cheap explosives to the coal-miner who is paid by results ? If it does not do itswork properly and blow the coal down, a cheap explosive becomes a dear explosive. It is essential that our coalminers should have thevery best article in order to get the best results. As I have already said, I have been dealingwith this question of certificates since 1910, and the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> has been agitating for a longer term even than that. It isvery important that a testing station should be erected in Australia, because if untested explosives are used in a gaseous mine and if a charge gives off the slightest fire at all, it may ignite the coal dust, and thewhole of the men employed in the mine will, probably, be sent to eternity, as in the case of the recent Mount Mulligan disaster. It has been stated that every ounce of the locally manufactured explosive is tested. Any one acquainted with the position knows that is a practical impossibility, because we have no testing station here. If the representative of the local company is within sound of my voice, I am sure he will admit it would be impossible to test thewhole of the explosives manufactured in Australia without a proper gallery such as is provided in England.At present the Australian article is sent to England to be tested. If it? passes the test, and the explosive is placed on the permitted list, a certificate is issued. But here is the point: Parcels of explosives are sent Home only occasionally for testing purposes, in order to get on the permitted list, which means that the explosive may be used in gaseous mines. We may safely assume that only picked parcels would be sent. </para>

            <para>- Of course it has; and I am not challenging its reputation. I am only asking if it is possible, without a proper testing station in Australia, to test the whole of the explosives manufactured here. Is not that a fair proposition to put up? Prior to the war I asked my then Leader,whowas Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline> to erect a testing station. He obtained reports and ascertained that the cost would be about &#163;10,000. The Government of the day agreed to erect the station, but the Avar intervened, and, subsequently, the Labour Government went out of office. I then brought the matter before the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> who also was sympathetic, and promised that something should be done, but, in consequence of the Avar,  the work has not been proceeded with. Wewant no repetition of the Bulli, Mount Kembla, or Mount Mulligan disasters. </para>

        <para>If we can get proper explosives in future in Australia, nobody will support the industry more readily than the Newcastle and Maitland miners. What is the position there to-day? Some of the men in the Newcastle district areworking only ten shifts a fortnight, and the other day I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> if something could be done to help them in their present distress. These men should not be called upon to pay exorbitant prices for their explosives. They do not take exception to the local explosive simply because it is manufactured in Australia. Their contention is that they have been unjustly treated in the past by this Combine, which imposed additional charges upon them. They now want a fair deal. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> has admitted thatwhen the Tariff was introduced nearly eighteen months ago he made provision for a deferred duty, because he believed we would be able to get the explosives manufactured in Australia. He knows now that we are in no better position to-day than we were then. The Senate&#39;s requested amendment is absurd. That Chamber has requested that duties of 15 per cent. British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 25 per cent, general be imposed on coalgetting explosives; that is to say, on explosives which must pass the test in order to be placed on the permitted list, whilst explosives n.e.i., that is, explosives which are not required to pass a test, are to be allowed in free in tie British Tariff, 10. per cent, in the intermediate, and 15 per cent, in the general Tariff. This means that miners working in the more dangerous mines of the Commonwealth are to be called upon to pay from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, higher duty on- their explosives than miners in non-gaseous and metalliferous mines, in which explosives not on the permitted list may be used. Some of the collieries in the Newcastle district are non-gaseous, and therefore miners are not&#34; obliged to use safety lamps &#39;or explosives that are on the permitted list, whereas in other mines where gas is present, only &#34;permitted&#34; explosives carrying a higher rate of duty must be used. I speak with some feeling on this subject, because I have been right through the mill myself, and I know what it means. I am afraid of something happening almost every day, and I urge on the Government the need for immediate action to test explosives. The first step should be the erection of a testing station. If the Committee accepts the Senate&#39;s request it will be doing a great injustice to those engaged in the coal-mining industry. But there is a distinction again, because, in the metalliferous mines, less is paid for the explosives used than must be paid for the explosives permitted to be used in coal mines. It would appear that those working in the dangerous mines are specially marked out for unfair treatment. It is obvious that some one interested has gained the ear of the Senate, and succeeded in having the request made. </para>

If the Minister for Defence had known how its acceptance <inline font-style="italic">would</inline> be applied, he would not have moved as he did. The suggested amendment was undoubtedly inspired by somebody interested in the explosives industry. A tale was pitched, and the Senate &#34; swallowed &#34; it. I hope the Committee will stand by its original decision. I have a return before me which indicates the quantity of explosives imported during last year from South Africa and Great Britain. The figures reveal that very little is _ manufactured in Australia. The sole purp&#39;ose of the request is to cloak, the Combine existing in Great Britain, but since the position is exactly the same as when this Committee originally considered the matter, I hope that no amendment will be agreed to. </para>

          <para>. -  All those who know anything of the horrors of mining accidents will agree that if the only safe explosive manufactured were that produced by black labour it certainly should be used in preference to any other.  I am not less interested in the Welfare of Australian miners than other honorable members; but, so far as the attitude of the coal miners is concerned, I am confident that with them it is a question, not of safety, but of cost. Representatives of the Explosives Employees Union laid their case before the coal-miners in writing, but the whole of the argument advanced in reply was based on the question of the cost of the Australian article. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis,</inline> secretary of the Miners Federation, said, without making any effort to hide his position, &#34; We intend to get our explosives as cheaply as we can.&#34; Not one, word was said about preference for one make as against another on the ground of safety. Is one to believe that all the mining accidents throughout the world have occurred because Australian explosives were used ? It would be foolish to advance such an explanation. The fact is that most of the great tragedies of the mines have been inevitable, no matter what may have been the make of explosive used. I emphasize that the question is one of cost, and not, primarily, of </para>

The positionwould he altogether different if the mine-owner paid for the explosives. The coal-miner, just like every other individual, is out to make the most money he can get for the work which he performs, and, if he can save a little in the purchase of his explosives, he will do so. Why should not that be admitted by the coal-miners&#39; representatives in this Chamber? An advocate of the White Australia policy who prefers to use an imported explosive, made by black labour, becauseit is cheaper than that made by white Australian workmen, is not a true White Australian at heart. The coal-miners themselves admit that, if the owners paid for the explosives, they would not care very much where the material came from so long as it was up to standard. It is obvious that even amongst members of the working community there is just as much selfishness and self-interest as exists among the employing classes. </para>

The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> has urged to-night that the safety of the miners who use explosives should be our first consideration. There is no one more anxious than the honorable member for Maribyrnong, myself, and others, who desire to further the interests of the Australian industry, that every precaution should be taken to insure their safety. That consideration is of paramount importance, and if I felt that the lives of the miners would be endangered by the use of Australian explosives, I would not support the amendment. But what are the facts? The honorable member for Hunter has said that specially&#39; packed boxes of explosives made in Australia might be sent to the testing station in the Old Country, and that satisfactory tests could thus be obtained. As a matter of fact, I am given to understand that it is not the explosives themselves, but the formula used in their manufacture, that is tested. </para>

            <para>- Then it would be in teresting to learn what is the exact procedure followed, and I look to the officers of the Department to supply us with authoritative information on this subject. Whatever may be the procedure in regard to the testing of Australian explosives, that adopted in the testing of the South African product is exactly the same. There is more likelihood of fair and honest dealing in the Australian industry than in connexion with an industry carried on in some other country. </para>

            <para>- That being so, no advantage can be claimed for the South African explosives as against those produced in this country. The only thing that can be said in favour of the South African product- is that because of the cheap-labour conditions in the industry there the coal-winners of Australia are able to obtain cheaper explosives, but they can obtain them only at the expense of those engaged in the Australian industry. As one who desires at all times to support Australian industries and to assist those engaged in them, I cannot vote to give an , advantage to imports from a country where the industrial conditions are inferior to those which obtain here. The arguments which the Honorable member for Hunter has advanced in opposition to these duties might have been urged with equal force in connexion with other items for which he has voted, notwithstanding that considerably higher duties are imposed under them. The request 12644 <inline font-style="italic">Customs Tariff&#91;</inline> REPRESENTATIVES.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> made by the Senate, however, would not suit the miners whom the honorable member represents. I recognise that he has a right to endeavour to give effect to their desires, but as I have neither coal-miners nor employees of an explosives factory in my electorate, I can take an entirely unprejudiced view of this matter; and as one who desires to foster Australian industry, and so to provide new avenues of employment for our own people, I shall support the amendment. </para>

          <para>.- I offer no apology for rising to address the Committee at this late hour. I have endeavoured to ascertain what procedure is followed in regard to the testing of explosives. I find that explosives are manufactured in Australia in accordance with the British formula; that the manufactured article is sent to Great Britain for testing purposes, and that analyses are made there to determine whether they are in accordance with the formula which has been supplied. A test is made, and if it proves satisfactory the explosives are passed. The same course is followed in regard to all explosives, whether they are to be used in the United Kingdom or Australia. There can be no question that the Australian explosives are the product of white labour, whereas for the most part the imported explosives are made by coloured labour. For something like sixteen or eighteen years. I was a representative of the coal-miners on the Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales, and from what I know of them I am convinced that they would be prepared to give a preference to the product , of white labour, even if that would involve the payment of slightly increased prices for their explosives. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. As Protectionists we have said over and over again that the imposition of a duty in respect of any commodity, does not necessarily mean an increased price for that commodity. We have been penalized by importers in the absence of local competition. Did we not try a few years ago to get the people of Australia to give this Parliament power to deal with monopolies ? Was not one of the reasons which we gave at that time for seeking power to deal with monopolies that Aus tralia hadnot advanced sufficiently to make it self-contained ? I feel that if the question of coloured labour is involved I must vote for a greater measure of protection in order to give work to the Australian people. I know the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> is naturally sympathetic with the cause of the miners. He is human, and is subject to votes. I also am subject to votes. The vote I will give, and I think the vote that should be given should be designed to keep within Australia the production of explosives, and to exclude the products of coloured labour, with which Australia cannot compete. I do not speak disrespectfully of a man because he is coloured, but I am afraid that if Australia encourages him to send his products here, the workers of Australia may have to come down to his level. Instead of that, it should be our object to lift him to our level. I feel that the Committee should not hurry this matter through. The Government should give members at least an opportunity to consider whether miners should have cheap explosives the product of coloured labour, or should pay a little more for the product of Australian white labour. My feelings are very strong on the point. It is now more than fifty years sinceI first struck out in favour of Protection and a White Australia. I felt then that I was doing the right thing, and I feel now that I did the right thing. I cannot vote except to make Australia self -contained and to continue the White Australia policy. . This bold policy has made Australia famous throughout the world, and I think the people of other countries are in agreement with us on this point. </para>

            <para>- I am not at all satisfied from the information I have been able to gather since this matter first came up that the wool in Australia would be a satisfactory substitute for kapok for bedding purposes; on the contrary, I think it would in all probability be found very unsatisfactory. I do not think that the proposal of the Senate would assist materially in utilizing the surplus coarse wools for which there is now no use. Under the circumstances, the duty would, in my opinion, merely prove a heavy tax, which would result in the collection of a considerable amount of revenue; and this is not an item on which we ought to collect revenue.For that reason I move - </para>

            <para>- Honorable members know what the real intention of the proposal is. It is to prevent our superphosphate works and deposits on Ocean Island and Nauru Island being subject to Japanese competition. That is the whole story. I have been perfectly frank with the &#34;Committee. We have large deposits in those islands, and we wish to see our Australian works there using up those deposits, because it is only by Australia taking her full quota from &#34;the islands that we can reap the true benefit we ultimately anticipate from the possession of them. </para>

        <para>Mr.GREENE. - Even if produced within the Empire, provided the rock phosphate itself was won from without the British Empire. I am satisfied that the Senate did not intend to make other manures dutiable, nor do we. It is therefore necessary to make the modifications of the Senate&#39;s request which I have mentioned. &#39;Some honorable members have raised doubt as to the possibility of superphosphates being imported from places other than those within the British Empire. I can give figures of the importations in 1913 before the war. In that year the United Kingdom sent us 184,273 cwt. of superphosphates, Japan sent us 221,231 cwt., and Germany 114,600 cwt-. </para>

            <para>- I am quoting from the official statement of imports, item 685, page 221 of the document, table No. 2, importations in 1913 into Australia, and these figures are given under the heading, &#34; Superphosphates.&#34; There can be no question that these importations were superphosphates. I propose that importations from Britain should be admitted free; but I admit that, under my proposal, superphosphates imported from Japan or Germany would be dutiable. That will be the position under the modification of the Senate&#39;s request, to which I am asking the Committee to agree. We have two objects to serve in this connexion. Honorable members are no doubt aware that the arrangements made cover the working of the phosphatic deposits in both Nauru and Ocean Island. We desire to secure that, as far as possible, superphosphates used in Australia shall be drawn from those sources. The greater the quantity we draw from those islands the greater the benefit we shall reap from them. At present the Commission operating them have to carry heavy amortization charges, and it will be some time before they will be worked off, and we can obtain the full benefit of the possession of the islands referred to. The greater the quantity of superphosphate we get from outside, the smaller will be the extent to which we shall draw upon our own deposits, and the longer it must be before we can secure the full benefit of their possession. The Government are anxious, naturally, to protect our position in Nauru and Ocean Islands. The Commission handling the rock phosphates of the islands has to pay interest and sinking fund on the purchase, and it is to-day, in addition, building up a reserve fund from which it is proposed toerect improved handling appliances, which will result in the rock phosphates being delivered into the. ships very much more rapidly than is possible under existing </para>

This is very desirable, because the greater the demurrage on ships in loading, the more the expense of bringing the rock phosphates to Australia. The more custom we can throw in the way of the Commission by drawing all our supplies of rock phosphates from those islands the better, and everything is being done to secure that end. I repeat that to all intents and purposes the only superphosphate that will be really dutiable under the item, if modified as I propose, will be Japanese superphosphate, and, possibly, also German superphosphate. As we renew trading relations with Germany there may be a certain amount coming from there. With the exception of superphosphates from those two countries, I do not think any imported will be dutiable. Reference has been made to basic phosphate, and I am satisfied that that will fall under the proposed sub-item which will cover manures, n.e.i. </para>

        <para class="block">Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> would give us a clean sheet on this item. He has admitted that there is no fear that this country will be rushed in the future, any more than it has been in the past, with foreign superphosphates. He proposes to put up a wall in anticipation of something that is not likely to occur, but behind that wall Combines that are already receiving much more than they should receive for the manures they supply to Australian farmers will be able to reap further  advantage. I want a division on the motion, because I am expecting the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> and the honorable member for Hunter (Mr: Charlton) to vote with me. I could quote a schedule of arguments which they have used in support of the position I take up on this item. They would be very interesting. The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> should sympathize with us in this matter, because a little while ago he was flogging  a  dead horse ; though he is not often in that position. There is nothing of more importance to the primary producers than a supply of superphosphates, which is the foundation of successful agriculture. We were told, when the duty on explosives was being discussed, that it had the effect of increasing the price of explosives; that these were purchased by the miner, and therefore the increase in the price affected him and not the coal-owner, and he was not disposed to hear it. Similarly, I say that the farmer is not disposed to bear the proposed increase in the price of manures. Japan has been too sensible to send manures here. Her territory is much smaller&#39; than Australia., and her population very much larger than ours, so that she needs all the manure that she can put into her soil to increase its productivity. When Australia secured an interest in Nauru, it was expected that our primary producers would obtain superphosphates more cheaply; but we have never been told at what figure the phosphatic rock is broken down, or what are the shipping freights, or the interest and sinking fund charges. We should have information on these matters, and everything possible should be done to give the farmers cheaper manure. Before the war. superphosphates cost &#163;4 2s.  6d. per ton in Western Australia, and today they cost &#163;6 15s. a ton, and have no more manurial value. </para>

            <para>- The produce grown by the farmers who use these superphosphates is now being sold at pre-war rates, so that their margin of profit is very much lower than it was. The farmers might rightfully look for a decrease of &#163;2 12s. 6d. in the price of superphosphates, but if the proposed duties are imposed, the Combine which controls the trade will penalize the men on the land by keeping the price of superphosphates at what it is now. When this market was open to Japan and to Germany, our farmers did not deal with those countries for superphosphates, but got their supplies from local companies, and they could be trusted to continue to do so. When the division takes place, it will be seen who are the real Australians. No industry is more important to this country than that of the primary producer. Fertilizers are used not only for the growing of wheat and oats, but also for the growing of other crops, and they can be appliedwith advantage to grass fields. We hear of the ships that are lying idle&#34;. Why cannot some of them be used to reduce freights and to bring down prices ? If superphosphates were cheaper, our land would produce more. Cheap manures would be the greatest blessing Australia could have. In my opinion, there should be no duty on manures. </para>

          <para>. - Apparently it is desired by some honorable members that this country shall be subjected to the same kind of competition in regard to superphosphates as it has to meet in regard to explosives, the competition of the black-labour product of South Africa. There are in Australia eleven superphosphateworks,two being in New South Wales, four in Victoria, three in South Australia, and twoin Western Australia. About &#163;3,000,000 has been invested in the business of making superphosphates,which gives direct employment to 2,000 men, and about 400,000 tons of superphosphates are produced annually. It is proposed that superphosphates manufacturedwithin the British Empire shall come here free, and, as honorable members are aware, South Africa is within the Empire. The production of superphosphates in Japan in 1914 was equal to 514,000 tons, and the capacity of their production in 1921 is equal to 1,100,000 tons per annum. According to information supplied to me, the Cape Explosives Works are completing a factory capable of producing 70,000 tons of superphosphates per annum, although the local requirements are approximately less than one-half of that quantity. What are they to do with the remaining 35,000 tons? </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is a Free Trader, and I am surehe realizes that there is every possibility of superphosphates produced by black labour coming into competition with the local product. If the Minister is in possession of this information he is not acting fairly in the interests of Australia. It is just as bad to use superphosphates manufactured by black labour as it is to use axplosives, and it is just as bad to utilize a product of South Africa in this direction as it is the superphosphates produced under cheap labour conditions in Japan. Our superphosphate manufacturers have no protection in this connexion, because South Africa is within the British Empire. I do not know whether the proposed Tariff Board will make certain recommendations to the Minister in the hope of rescuing some of our industries from competition with cheap labour countries. Up to the present there has been a number of promises, but very little action. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member heard me state that the works are only in course of erection, and he surely knows that coloured labour enters very largely into the production of any commodity in that country, whether it is in mining coal, gold, diamonds, or in the manufacture of explosives or superphosphates. We have a right to protect the manufacturers of superphosphates in Australia, and the workers engaged: in those factories from the cheap labour competition with South Africa. This aspect of the question should be very carefully considered. I do not know what the Minister intends doing, and I do not know whether he has been primed with these facts. It seems extraordinary that information of this character should be available to a. private member, and that it should not be in the possession of the Minister. If he has been informed, and <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> face of these facts1 is prepared to give the local manufacturers away to this extent, he is recreant to the best interests of the community. During the war, Australian manufacturers sold superphosphates at an average of &#163;6 per ton, whilst other countries were selling at from &#163;15 to &#163;20 per ton. </para>

The honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> said certain manufacturers did not treat the Australian public as fairly as they ought to have done; but, notwithstanding the figures he quoted, I believe the phosphate manufacturers did treat the users of that commodity justly. This new factory in South Africa is not being established for fun. It may be connected with&#39; a company already established here, or it may be another name for the De Beers Combine. According to the Minister&#39;s proposition, manures manufactured within the Empire are to be admitted free, irrespective of the labour conditions. As far as practicable, I intend to support the policy of trading within the Empire; but, if there are conditions in any part of the Empire which are inimical to the best interests of the Australian workers, I shall fight strenuously against such competition. </para>

            <para>-  The arrangement will practically mean throwing the industry open to competition from abroad, which will prevent the phosphate companies in Australia from taking any undue advantage. At the same time, we shall get security from competition from one or two sources, which, if it developed, would materially affect our own deposits at Naurn and Ocean Island. </para>

            <para>- The Farmers Co-operative Company is not afraid of outside competition. Australian labour is as efficient as labour in other parts of the world ; we are prepared to pay white labour at white labour rates, and to install the best machinery and handling plant. We believe we can compete with the outside world, and are not afraid of the Japanese or any othercompetitors. In answer to inquiries we made recently, we were informed that Japanese superphosphates cannot be landed in Australia at less than &#163;10 per ton. Japanese manufacturers have no earthly chance of competing at that price. </para>

          <para>. - I would like to have some information with regard to the 20 per cent. duty suggested as the general Tariff. The fact that machinery of this class is necessary in educational institutions and public hospitals should surely relieve them of being asked to contribute to the revenue of the Commonwealth, no matter from what source the machinery comes. I have in mind special forms of electrical apparatus, which are in many cases patented, and are manufactured only in certain countries, not being obtainable from any. other countries. </para>

          <para>. - There are quite a number of items that have been treated in this way. The reason is that, during the war, it was found that Great Britain&#39;s supply of scientific apparatus was deficient, and also during the war she built up her industries in this regard to a very material degree. It was decided, in view of the great difficulties Great Britain experienced, to endeavour under this Tariff to do something to further develop the manufacture of scientific instruments and machinery. This amendment does not go quite so far as one or two others have. The Senate has added public hospitals to sub-item  a,  but there is a further sub-item c, which reads - </para>

          <para>. - Deferred duties have generally been imposed in anticipation of the establishment of an industry, but the shipbuilding industry, commenced practically at the invitation of the Commonwealth Government, has already got a footing in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania. When the Commonwealth Government laid out its shipbuilding programme, the New South Wales Government spent thousands of pounds in fitting up one of the best yards and workshops in Australia for the purpose, and was thus able to meet the demand for ships during the war ; but now, with the discontinuance of Commonwealth orders, those yards are, as far as shipbuilding is, concerned, idle. I understand that practically the same conditions apply at. Williamstown, in the Commonwealth yards. We brought expert shipbuilders here and trained our own workmen in the art of shipbuilding. The work they have done on the vessels already completed compares more than favorably with similar work done elsewhere. It has also been carried out very expeditiously, six 5,000-ton vessels having been built in New South Wales in two years. It is true that there is at present a slump in shipping, and that tonnage can be bought cheaper than it can be built in Australia, but the workmanship in the vessels so acquired will not be of the quality that has been put into vessels built by our own workmen in Australia, who are now at the mercy of the competition of the world. I do not wish to bring under the drag-net of Customs taxation any vessels ordered prior to this date, but I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is making a mistake in fixing the date at 1924 before making it operative in respect of other ships. </para>

          <para>- If we are not going to build any more ships, then the fixing of the date does not matter at all. Ships are laid up all over the world. The Commonwealth Government encouraged outside business firms to spend huge sums of money in establishing shipbuilding yards, and even if the Government are not going to build ships themselves, these people have a right to consideration. The various companies whose ships are trading around our coast, and who get their trade from Australians, should be patriotic enough to provide employment for Australian workmen who have been trained in the business. I trust that the Minister will adhere to the original date, 1923 </para>

          <para>. - If the duties are imposed there will be an addition of 5s. in the &#163;1 in the cost of all vessels. The statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that 11,000.000 tons of shipping are lying idle in different parts of the world, but chiefly in Great Britain and America, is no exaggeration of the position. I agree with the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> that the quality of work on vessels built in Australia is of the very highest order; but the cost of these ships is roughly &#163;30 per ton, whereas first-class boats may be bought to-day at from &#163;7 to &#163;10 per ton. </para>

If honorable members will peruse Lloyd&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Shipping Register,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Motor Ship, Fairplay,</inline> or any other publication dealing with the shipping of the world, they will find that fully 11,000,000 tons of shipping are hung up in various parts of the world. We have  a number of Commonwealth ships lying idle in our own ports, and may I interpolate here that, whilst our own shipping is held up for want of cargo, the Wheat Corporation have not yet been able to secure freightage in any of the Commonwealth vessels? </para>

            <para>- No man in his senses would think of investing his capital in a business venture for the construction of ships, which will take at least twelve months to get into commission, at a capital cost of about &#163;30 per ton when very good vessels may be bought at up to &#163;10 per ton. Owing to an unfortunate set of circumstances during the last couple of years all round the Australian coastline, a large number of small trading vessels have been lost. The capital cost of our own boats to-day, compared with&#39; pre-war rates, shows an increase of 285 per cent.; and if we further increase the price by imposing duties that are equivalent to another 5s. in the &#163;1, we shall be doing an in jury to those who use the ships. The effect of continuing to build ships at the price which one is compelled to pay to-day is practically to impose a levy by way of unduly heavy freights upon produce shipped from Australia and goods imported. Such a policy is a mistake. Honorable members must be convinced that the imposition of the proposed duty will not encourage the laying down of one keel in Australia. An error will be committed, therefore, if this 25 per cent. is added to the capital cost of ships, which must continue to carry the extra burden during the whole period of their running in commission. If there is one thing Australia requires to-day it is cheap freights; but we cannot have low freights and high capital costs, with heavy running charges. We are not in a position to deal with running charges ; but if capital cost is added to by the burden of this uncalled-for duty, the position becomes more than ever serious for the Commonwealth. It is a bad state of affairs that Commonwealth vessels should be gathering barnacles and their crews paid off while Australian produce is being shipped away in other bottoms. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is misjudging me. Does he think that the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent. will encourage the laying down of a single keel? The building of a vessel in Australia will cost about &#163;35 per ton, and will take many months to complete, but any one can cable to England and purchase a ship at less than half the cost and have her placed in commission forthwith. This item of the Tariff is intended  to secure revenue, pure and simple. 1 emphasize that the effect of the 25 per cent, duty will be simply to add that proportion of cost to freight charges. </para>

            <para>- I challenge the honorable member&#39; to try to run one of them around the Australian coast. He would not secure a crew. These cheap and worn-out craft scarcely conform to the requirements of our Navigation Act. But if boats can be purchased at &#163;10 per ton or less, the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, would still make them relatively so cheap that they could be run here. That is to say, in actual cost, they could successfully compete in securing Australian freightage. Our own &#34;Austral &#34; Line is almost obsolete, but these other cheap ships are comparative- hulks. I think that an error was committed* in not imposing the duty from the date on which the Senate made its request. The outcome has been, no doubt, that the cables have been busily at work, and options have been secured over vessels in the Old Country in order that the duty may be evaded. </para>

            <para>- I did not say that, but that if they were purchased for as little as &#163;10 per ton it would pay the buyers to bring them out to secure Australian trade, even in the face of a 25 per cent. duty. As . a matter of fact, the lowest price at which they will be able to secure vessels will probably be in the neighbourhood of &#163;25 per ton. I cannot understand the purpose of the Government in fixing 1924 for the imposition of the duty. It is- not necessary that vessels should arive here before 1st January, 1924. They may come in free at any time, after that date, provided that they have been ordered before to-day. Is that not so? </para>

I know that it is useless to fight against the Minister&#39;s proposal, because he can defeat us, but I thought that an earnest effort was to be made to encourage shipbuilding in Australia. If the Ministry are not in earnest, then we must, perforce, accept what they offer us. I am, however, very much, disappointed. It seems to me that by the time this duty comes into operation such shipbuilding yards as we have carrying on operations to-day will have been closed down. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene),</inline> having regard to the position of ship-owners in Australia, and their relation to war services, has made a fair proposal. It is unnecessary, at this stage, to talk about the ships that are tied up, because I gather from the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that in the course of the next few days we shall have an opportunity to discuss that matter. I should have been dissatisfied if the Minister had been&#39; less generous in his treatment of local shipowners. Having regard to the position occupied by them, not of their own choosing, but because of conditions that were forced on them owing to war responsibilities, and accepted generously, the Minister would have been unfair had he given them no opportunity to restore their fleets to their normal strength. In the interests of Australian shipping, the Minister has met the position. </para>

The necessity for the extension proposed by the Senate is revealed by an examination of the service of the North Coast Shipping Company of New South Wales, with which the Minister is familiar. That company serves a system of rivers and districts which have not been joined up with their markets by any railway, but are entirely dependent on steamer traffic. </para>

            <para>- I do not think we shall have a North Coast Railway before 1930. With the exception of a couple of roadsteads, all these rivers are cursed with bars, and this has necessitated a very special type of boat construction. Many attempts have been made to secure a satisfactory class of vessel for the service, but many that have been ordered have proved unsatisfactory for the work required of them on these rivers. The practice of the steam-ship company in question, as a result of the trouble it has experienced,has been to place its orders with special firms of shipbuilders in Scotland. At the present time the bulk of its fleet is largely worn out. It was unable to replace any of its steamers during the war, and it had the misfortune, a few months ago, to suffer a serious loss by the wreck of the <inline font-style="italic">Wollonbar.</inline> With these duties, combined with the huge increase in the cost of shipbuilding; the replacing of those of the company&#39;s steamers which need to be replaced within the next three or four years will entail a capital expenditure in excess of its total capital and reserves. The company cannot raise in these difficult times that additional capital within the short space of time fixed under the Minister&#39;s proposal so as to be able to proceed immediately with its building programme. It will take it some three years to place its orders. As an illustration of the increased cost of shipbuilding, I would point out that whereas the <inline font-style="italic">Wollonbar</inline> cost &#163;83,000 to build some few years ago, a tender received recently for the construction of a similar vessel amounted to &#163;163,000. </para>

            <para>- Tenders obtained from Scotland for building a vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Orara</inline> type fixed the cost at &#163;120,000. Ten years ago the vessel would have cost &#163;32,000 to build. A tender was also obtained from Walsh Island, which the company would be loath to accept, even at the same price as the Scottish tender, because of the difficulty that has been experienced in getting a proper design for building these vessels. The Walsh Island tender was &#163;180,000, or &#163;60,000 more than the cost in Scotland. That represents much more than 25 per cent. duty. The duty could not prevent the order being placed in Scotland. The cost- of the construction of these two boatsalone is equal to the present total capital of the company, which is regarded as being in a fairly large way of business. In addition, many other boats are necessary for the smaller rivers. The company&#39;s fleet is wearing out; some of the boats are twenty years old, and the bulk of them are fifteen years old. In these circumstances I would like to see the time for the imposition of the duty extended to 1925, or, at any rate, that some provision should be made whereby, if orders are placed before that time, the vessels will be allowed to come in. free of duty. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister will give us his assurance to that effect I think it will meet the case. Everybody in Australia is desirous of seeing the shipbuilding industry encouraged to the greatest possible extent. Unless some relief is provided the increased price caused by the duty will be a permanent charge during the life of each vessel not only on the producers and inhabitants of the Northern Rivers district, but on the consumers of the big industrial centres, and the imposition of the duty will not cause vessels to be built in Australia. The cost of the building of the <inline font-style="italic">Orara</inline> in Scotland, plus the duty, is &#163;30,000 less than the tender received from Walsh Island. There is no possibility of work being done in Australia in these conditions. </para>

If there is one particular industry that should receive special consideration at the hands of this Committee it is the shipbuilding industry. Surely our experience during war-time ought to have been sufficient to make us realize the perilous position that we place ourselves in by being dependent on other countries for ships to take our products to the other side of the world. The Minister, last March, very clearly indicated the necessity for the Commonwealth encouraging the local shipbuilding industry. </para>

          <para>What was it that led to the waste of enormous quantities of primary products here? Was it not the fact that Australia had no shipping, due entirely to our past neglect to establish the shipbuilding industry, one of the greatest of the industries that any insular community should do its utmost to build up? Our neglect in this respect led to the parlous position in which Australia found itself, and caused our primary producers to suffer the loss of millions of pounds through being unable to ship their products to the markets of the world. Had we been in a position to build our own ships, and send our wheat abroad independent of the tonnage we could induce the British Government to send to us from time to time, the wheat-growers of Australia would have secured an infinitely better price throughout the war, and all the waste that took place would have been avoided. </para>

        <para class="block">After the experience that was gained at so great a cost during the war this Committee ought not to fail to take heed of the lesson and to rectify what has been proved to be a serious oversight on the part of the Government. The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McWilliams)</inline> said that there was obtainable to-day cheaper tannage than could previously be secured, and that it was possible to buy ships at a less price per ton than it was possible to build them for in Australia. To a very large extent these circumstances prove the fallacy of many of the provisions in the Peace Treaty, because the handing over of a number of vessels by Germany to the Allied countries meant that these vessels were left on the hands of the Allied Governments, who had to dispose of them at a cheaper rate than the price chargeable in the various ship-yards. As a result the German shipbuilders are going full steam ahead and are employed full time, while British and&#34; Australian shipwrights are having to walk the streets. The honorable member for Franklin also made a suggestion that there was to-day a boycott of Australian freightage. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister did not say it was ridiculous; and &#39;I have no doubt the Combine has been able to exact its demands. We should, as far as possible, endeavour to protect the Australian people, and especially the primary producers, from the undue impositions that are possible because of the complete monopoly which is enjoyed under present circumstances. If we are to have a Government Line of Steamers we should not be dependent on shipbuilding yards abroad to contract for the tonnage we require. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. There is invested in Australia, in the shipping industry, over &#163;3,000,000, and there are about 5,000 skilled men employed, many of whom, to my own knowledge, left good, positions in the Government Service to undertake their present work. They gave up the privileges and emoluments of the Public Service in order to devote themselves to the promotion of this new&#39; industry, and they have made themselves experts. This has been the case in South Australia; and it will be nothing short of a scandal if we, at this moment, forsake them, and thus fail to carry out our part of the compact. Any .one who has foresight in public affairs is at a -loss to understand the attitude of the Government. </para>

        <para>There is one anomaly to which I should like to call attention, for, perhaps, it has been overlooked by honorable members. The parts and fittings required for the construction of a vessel have to pay duty; but when they come here assembled as the complete article, they are admitted practically free. Our own workmen have never had an opportunity of taking a hand in the construction of such vessels, but are deliberately denied employment. The Government are seeking to promote immigration, and at the same time absolutely declining to provide means of employment for immigrants. Even at this late hour, the Minister might be prevailed upon to show some consideration for those interested in the Australian shipbuilding trade. I have had the pleasure of visiting Walsh Island, where I saw the most up-to-date plant and accommodation for the largest size of vessels required for the Australian service. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook),</inline> when in South Australia, had the advantage of inspecting an up-to-date plant for shipbuilding, which is equipped with high-grade machinery capable of dealing with all demands for the complete and efficient construction of vessels, and he must have been surprised at the progress made. Where that plant is, accommodation for the building of 12,000-ton vessels is available if orders can be secured. The enterprise of this firm, Messrs. Poole and Steel, is to be commended, and they have the strongest claims possible for ample protection and support in their endeavours to advance this great industry. There seems to . be a prospect of the Commonwealth not pursuing its shipbuilding policy. I hope that that prospect will not be realized; but when we see amongst the Government&#39;s own supporters men who opposed the shipbuilding policy, we realize that there is a likelihood of lack of ardour in carrying on the industry, especially when the pressure of the Shipping Combine is made upon a Government so pliant to its instructions; because, assuredly, the Shipping and Commercial Combines are the true masters of the present Federal Government. If the Government are now less likely to give orders to the various yards, it is our duty to protect the shipbuilders here by making the Combine have its tonnage constructed by them. The Prime Minister&#39;s own constituency shows that the work given by shipbuilding is not confined to the yards; and most of the engineering firms in South Australia are engaged on work for Messrs. Poole and Steele, who are now building vessels for the Government. There are. many allied industries which will be adversely affected if shipbuilding receives a check. Even in the electorate of the Prime Minister, at Gastlemaine, there is a firm, Messrs. Thompson and Company, who make marine engines equal to any produced elsewhere. Messrs. Perry and Sons, of Adelaide, manufacture marine engines for ships built in that State with equal satisfaction. The workmanship in vessels built in Australia will compare more than favorably with that in imported vessels. An added advantage is secured to Australia by all deck fittings, furniture, and instruments used in the construction locally being made within our Commonwealth. I am in a position to say that the riveting in the <inline font-style="italic">Eurimbla,</inline> which was built in the South Australian yards, has not been equalled in. the building of any ship in any other part of the Commonwealth, and even, I may justifiably make claim, has not been excelled even in any other part of the world. </para>

I know that the men engaged in the South Australian shipping yards were previously employed in the locomotive workshops, and the excellence of the riveting to which I have referred is due to the fact that these men carried out in the shipbuilding yards the highly skilled and excellent work which they had previously done in the locomotive workshops, which is among the Highest grades of engineering. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider his proposal. I ask him to have some regard for the shipbuilding industry of Australia, and to give it the encouragement which it deserves, and at the same time givean evidence of prudentstatesmanship. </para>

            <para>- He is a short-sighted person who cannot count the cost, and the primary producer knows how to do so. We have many Government concerns in Australia that are so over-capitalized that neither the present nor the next generation can receive any benefit from, them. A ship built in Australia, or in any other place, at from 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. above the cost at which ships are produced elsewhere is of no use to the primary producer in Australia who is 12,000 miles away from the world&#39;s markets, because of high freights to pay for high capital costs. The vision of certain honorable members is so defective that they lose the substance in grasping for the shadow. They do not mind the burden which the people who must make use of the ships will be called upon to bear, so long as they are built here at any cost. Their purpose is merely to create work without counting the cost, and they do not mind throwing the burdens on other sections of the community. If Australia can produce ships at a price which will enable them to compete in the world&#39;s waters I am prepared to welcome them, . but honorable members opposite, after enjoying the pleasure of creating it, propose to pass their &#34;baby&#34; into my arms to nurse. I object to nursing other peoples&#39; babies. The primary producers of Australia are being asked to carry too many of these babies. It has been the desire in Australia in the past to get plenty of shipping here, and we require plenty of shipping to-day, but honorable members opposite are asking that we should put an embargo on shipping coming here. We have listened to the parrot cry about the trouble we got intoduring the war for lack of shipping. Every other country got into trouble for the same reason. Honorable members <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> make use of this cry now are out &#34;or disarmament and for cutting down the Defence Estimates. They are not axpecting any war, but are expecting other nations to give up war. The honorable member for Hindmarsh expects us to run a ship built at such a cost that she can never quote a reasonable Freight for those who use her. The honorable member is looking forward to another war, and expects us to carry on shipbuilding in Australia regardless of cost on his assumption that another war is coming. </para>

During the war the Go-&#39; vernment promised all who were prepared to engage in shipbuilding that everything possible would be done to protect them. On the strength of that promise, for which the Government were applauded during the war, shipbuilding plants were laid down, not only at Walsh Island, but at other places in Australia. I think that five of the States of the Commonwealth went in for shipbuilding. </para>

            <para>- I do not think they have. There is a difference between the Government not building ships and preventing the building of vessels in private yards. The effect of the Minister&#39;s proposal will be to make private shipbuilding yards, which have cost huge sums to equip, absolutely useless. I could have understood the Minister had he held to&#39; his position; but I cannot understand why, having fixed the date as 1st January, 1923, he should now propose to make it a year later. What he proposes cannot be justified on the ground that orders have been given for ships which have not yet been delivered. Those who have ordered ships knew the proposal in the Tariff and. took the risk. I&#39; do not say that vessels ordered prior to the date fixed should be levied upon. Had the Minister proposed to make the item read &#34; On and after 1st January, 1923, vessels, n.e.i., trading Intra-State, or Inter-State, or otherwise employed in Australian waters for any continuous period of three months, excepting vessels of 500 tons ordered prior to that date,&#34; the position would have been clear. But he is yielding to the prompting of the Senate,  or  of some one outside, in proposing to make the date 1st January, 1924. We have induced a number of persons to equip shipbuilding yards in Australia, and, as the honorable member for Hindmarsh has said, men who were following other occupations have been led to seek employment in those yards. They have done so on the strength of the Government&#39;s promise to foster shipbuilding, and to see that when the war was over work would be provided, as far as possible. I am not now contending that the Government should go on building ships; but Ministers should see that nothing is done to prevent the building of ships by private persons. It is idle to say that &#163;60,000 can be saved by building certain vessels in Scotland instead of in Australia. The conditions in other parts of the world are changing rapidly. Today there are thousands of unemployed persons in Great Britain, and the material for some of the work that is being done there has been brought from Germany, where it was purchased cheaply because of the fall in the value of. the German currency. Shall we allow our workmen to be discharged so that vessels may be made elsewhere of materia! brought from the country of our late enemy ? I have nothing to say against the workmen of other countries, but I contend that they should not be put in a better position than that of our own  workmen who stood by the Empire in its hour of need. Things are becoming worse every day because of the policy of the Government. Not only will what is proposed affect the building of ships, and thus decrease employment in the shipbuilding industry; it will also decrease employment in other industries furnishing material for shipbuilding. I remember when it was proposed that concessions should be given to a certain company to enable it to get the plant necessary for rolling plates for shipbuilding; but, that machinery having been installed, it is now proposed to take from the company the opportunity to use it. That is not fair to those who have invested money in the enterprise, or to the workers in the industry. Shipbuilding gives employment to many other persons besides those in the shipyards. How can this country pay its debts if its workers are thrown out of employment? We have been compelled to levy taxation wherever we can raise revenue, and have obtained a great deal of revenue by taxing companies, like the Broken Hill Company, which provide material for shipbuilding. Last year that company paid to the Commonwealth Government &#163;70,334 in war-time profits tax, and &#163;77,412 in income tax; while it paid to the New South Wales Government &#163;66,784, and to the South Australian Government &#163;28,054, or in all &#163;242,584. </para>

            <para>- In the action that I took in regard to the explosives duty, I was considering first of all the safety of human life, which is of paramount importance. The Government have induced these firms to undertake shipbuilding, under the conditions I have outlined. I quote from a letter from the Government Dockyard, dated 23rd September, 1921, addressed to the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Poynton)</inline> - 12,800-ton Steamers for Walsh Island. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>  I wish to earnestly solicit reconsideration of the question of placing anorder for two or three 12,800-ton steamers at this Dockyard. We are forced to bring this matter again to your attention, because of the extremely serious position which confronts the industry. The sympathetic attitude towards shipbuilding of the Prime Minister, yourself, and the other members of the Cabinet, leads us to hope that you will be so good as to bring this question forward for fresh discussion, particularly in light of the facts which are set forward herein. </para>
        <para>It is fully recognised that the Australian shipyards must look for their permanent livelihood to the private shipping companies, as much as to the Commonwealth Government. There are factors in the general business situation to-day, however, which make it impossible to obtain orders from private companies. For one thing, the Federal Tariff places no duty, as yet, on finished ships. Due to the cheaper raw material available to British shipbuilders (there being no Protective Tariff in Great Britain) the Australianship-owner finds it more to his advantage to place his orders in Great Britain. At this very writing, one of the New South Wales coastal steam-ship companies is about to place an order for a vessel worth some &#163;160,000. It appears as if all this work will be lost to Australia because the 25 per cent. duty is not yet operative. Obviously, the Tariff protection extended to steel, and all materials which we must use in the building of ships, fails of its purpose; while the ships, when finished, enjoy no correspondin protection. </para>
        <para>Your Government, and yourself, have frequently given recognition to the excellent equipment and organization at this Dockyard. In your very pleasing letter of 9th March, 1021, you stated: - &#34; I take this opportunity of complimenting your establishment on the successful carrying out of an extensive programme, which exceeds anything previously undertaken in the shipbuilding industry in Australia, and of tendering my appreciation of the manner in which the work has been performed.&#34; </para>
        <para class="block">All the conferences and correspondence we have had with your officers left with us the strongest impression that it was your intention bo place a further shipbuilding order with us. In this connexion, we would quote a letter, No. 1573, from the Prims Minister&#39;s Department, Ship Construction Branch, dated, 3rd July, 1920:- </para>

        <para class="block">It can plainly- be seen from that communication that that shipyard expected to receive further orders - that was what we were given to understand by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> - and &#163;250,000 was expended in equipping the yard in order to construct large vessels. Notwithstanding this, orders have been placed abroad for three vessels, possibly because they can be obtained at a somewhat lower rate. I doubt, however, whether this arrangement will be of any advantage to the Commonwealth, if everything is taken into consideration, because we have to consider the number of workmen who would be employed here, and the revenue that would be derived directly and indirectly from the workmen and those depending upon them. We have also to take into consideration the advantages that would be derived by other industries which would provide material that would be utilized in shipbuilding yards, and when these, and other points, are taken into the computation it is extremely doubtful if any advantage will be gained by placing orders abroad. I find, in connexion with the shipbuilding industry in Great Britain, the following extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Glasgow Financial Times,</inline> of 11th August, 1921: - &#34;The Safeguarding of Industries &#39;Bill was considered yesterday in the House of Commons. A new clause, moved for the purpose of exempting from the scope of the Act goods imported for the shipbuilding industry, was rejected. Supporters of the clause stated that the Bill as it stood was a serious menace to our shipyards. </para>

I do not think we are. We have to pay an extra price for ships, just as we do for other things, and we have to allow a fair profit to those who invest their capital in the industry. Bates will gradually be reduced, but it will be a long time before we reach normal conditions, because we cannot recover from the effects of the recent great catastrophe in a year or two. </para>

            <para>- I would not do anything to prevent private shipbuilders from accepting and executing orders. Honorable members are confusing the Government shipbuilding policy with private shipbuilding. If the Government have to tie up ships because there are no freights offering for them, nobody would be foolish enough to advocate that they should continue to build vessels when they cannot keep employed those they have already got. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. Even though a great quantity of tonnage is lying idle, why should we take steps to prevent people ordering from a private shipbuilder a special type of boat ? We have encouraged people to invest their capital in establishing shipbuilding yards. The work done by local enterprise during the last years of the war constitutes a fine monument to our people. Many things were produced in Australia which we had not expected to manufacture for very many years. Is it to be said that, the war being over, all the industrial effort put forth during war time is to go by the board ? </para>

            <para>- If the ships are not required, they will not be ordered; but it is possible that somebody may not be able to get a ship up to the standard he requires, and. he will be obliged to place an orderf or the construction of one. There is no reason why we should not provide for that vessel to be built in Australian yards. Repair work is not sufficient to keep in operation the yards which have been established, and unless we take steps to secure construction work for them the men who have been thrown into idleness will continue out of work. I have always advocated that everything possible should be done to provide employment, but the Government are doing all that is possible to permanently cripple the shipbuilding industry. I admit that the prospects of shipbuilding are not good in any part of the world, but that is no reason why we should set out to cripple an industry which we deliberately brought into existence during the war. Three years ago we were ready to applaud anybody who would undertake the local construction of ships. Why the Minister takes exception to my amendment I cannot understand ; it should meet the views of every honorable member, because I deliberately except the vessels exceeding 5.000 tons ordered prior to 1923. They will not be subject to any duty at nil. Of course, if a person orders a boat abroad after that date, knowing that the duty has to be paid, it is right that he should pay it, but he may choose to place his order locally. The Minister&#39;s proposal involves a reversal of the Committee&#39;s previous decision arrived at after mature consideration. If we insert the year 1924, as proposed by the Minister, every shipyard in Australia will be strangled. Local builders will have no hope of getting an order, and they might as well sell off their plant. The action proposed by the Government will be a breach of the promises made by this Parliament, and the Government, to those who were prepared to engage in shipbuilding in our time of need. </para>

            <para>- He has given none. He is compromising with the Senate, but he is doing a wrong both to those engaged in the industry and to the Commonwealth. I want some consideration of the very reasonable suggestion I have made. The matter is too important not to receive fair consideration from the Committee. I am always prepared to compromise when necessary, and my amendment is a compromise. In  consequence  of the exchange position, and other circumstances, dumping is taking place everywhere. It is not fair to quote the price -at which ships can be built in certain parts of the world as compared with Australia. With the exchange position as it is to-day, what is to prevent British firms going to Germany with a little capital, and buying large quantities of shipbuilding material at the low rates prevailing in that country 1 We should see that our shipbuilding yards have a fair deal. I am asking for proper treatment for Australian industries that have been established at our request. I have not yet forgotten the time when we were urging that everything possible in the direction of shipbuilding should be done, because the enemy had sunk many vessels by means of submarines. The shipbuilders in Australia came to our rescue, and did the best they possibly could under most adverse  circum-stances,  at a time when it cost more than prior to the war, and more than to-day, to establish a* shipbuilding yard. Those people did not hesitate. They had an assurance from us that, if they stood by us in our time of need, everything possible would be done to keep their industry alive. Are we now going to act as though there was never such an undertaking ? In the event of further trouble, we would appeal to those people again, and probably they would respond; but in view of the treatment they have received, we could hardly find fault with them if they refused to come to our aid. Hundreds of men have been put off. An order for three ships was placed outside of Australia when the cost of building was almost equivalent within the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased that the honorable member is so interested in the subject. He seems to know a good deal more about it than do many other honorable members. There are, as he says, reasonable grounds for complaining that after having made provision for the building of these vessels the State authorities got no orders for them. However, I am not worrying about that aspect&#39; of the question now, because the boats have been practically completed elsewhere, but I am concerned about the future. Are we to allow our shipbuilding yards to remain idle, or are we to give them the opportunity of taking orders from whatever source they come for the building of vessels? </para>

            <para>- The trouble is that if the&#39; duty is deferred to a later date there will be no possibility of our shipbuilding yards getting any work. It is less costly to purchase material in Germany and Belgium, and perhaps put it together in England. Our yards, therefore, will not get the work of building vessels until a duty is imposed. If my suggestion is adopted, we can do no injustice to any one, and at the same time may provide employment for our own people. </para>

            <para>- There is a good deal in the honorable member&#39;s contention. If a vessel could be purchased  abroad at half the cost of local construction it would still be  15  per cent. cheaper after the payment of a  35  per cent. duty, and, in such circumstances, an order for local construction would, probably, not be given. However, the difference in the cost of construction may not be so great in the near future. It may not exceed  25  per cent. In such a case Australians would probably patronize their own people rather than pay a duty of  35  per cent ; but if this duty is not imposed the local yards will not be likely to get orders. If we impose the duty it will not affect the point just raised by the honorable member. It is true that the purchasers of vessels built abroad would be obliged to pay the duty, but they would still save something after doing so. In the absence of protective duties there will be no hope for Australian shipyards. I do not know why the Minister stands up against this proposal. He has been most reasonable in regard to other matters, but in a simple matter like this he is obdurate, although it is just what he wants. If we leave the door open, as has been suggested, there will be no encouragement to the Australian industry. </para>

            <para>-  There is no chance, as far as I can see, at all events not until things settle down, of an order being placed in Australian shipyards for a ship which these duties would make it possible to build in this country. We must allow reasonable time for conditions to settle down, and that is why I suggest  1924  as a reasonable compromise. </para>

            <para>- The Minister&#39;s argument may be applied to everything that has been done in connexion with the Tariff. If the shipbuilding industry is to be saved, it will certainly be necessary to pass an anti-dumping law. The shipbuilding industry vitally affects the steel position. Therefore, if any dumping of shipbuilding material takes place, the effect upon the Newcastle Works will be very serious. Wo shall probably hear of a thousand men being paid off there. I do not see how the works can expect to keep going, but, apparently, we are to stand idly by until trouble occurs. I trust the Minister will give further consideration to this proposal. </para>

            <para>- I do not know of any circumstances that would justify the Committee in altering the decision arrived at when last these duties were discussed. On that occasion the Minister gave us the fullest information, but the Senate has seen fit to alter the sub.-item, and the Minister is now prepared to compromise on it, though his action, as I am endeavouring to show, is not in the best interests of the shipbuilding industry. We&#39; should do all we possibly can to insure the placing of orders with those yards&#34; that have been established in Australia, because the industry means the employment of a good deal of labour, and from that point of view it is important, so far as the people of Australia are concerned. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> in his Budget statement had something to say about  the increased capital that had been put into Australian industries, but it appears that the shipbuilding industry is to be deprived of the protection necessary for its further development. We have not only imposed a duty on the raw material, but we have said to enterprising private individuals, &#34; Establish your industry in Australia; it is essential that we should have ships built here. But, after having taxed your raw material as heavily as possible, we now intend to leave you to face outside competition without any help.&#34; In South Australia the shipbuilding firm of Poole and Steele have established a yard. They undertook activities at Port Adelaide, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, and with the encouragement and assistance of the State Government. The firm went to immense expense in building up new works, but they realize to-day that they must practically stand &#34; on their own.&#34; Even so, all that they ask is that they shall be given this reasonable degree of protection, and I cannot understand the objection to the proposal. I see no justification for extending the period after which the duty is to come into force. There are certain firms in Australia which, even now, are having vessels built for them abroad. Who can foretell what may happen withinthe next twelve months? What is the purpose of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> in departing from the original decision of the Committee? Either there are other ships contemplated to be put under construction by Australian owners, and it is desired that they shall be given some assistance, or the attitude of the Minister is entirely without reason. The question whether we are to continue to build ships for ourselves as a Commonwealth does not enter into consideration. The matter now is one for the private individual who has put his capital into the industry. </para>

The question of the continued existence of shipbuilding as an industry is of immense importance to Australia.Unless the Federal Government and Parliament do everything possible to encourage ship construction in private yards it is quite possible that the industry may become extinct.

          <para>. - The Government are making a mistake in pressing so gravely important a matter upon the Committee at this unearthly hour. When Australia decided to become a nation she had to accept certain responsibilities. One of these was to provide necessary shipping, both for coastal service and for keeping in touch with oversea markets. The shipping companies, local and foreign, which have been engaged upon these activities, have done well out of Australia. The country has been at their mercy. Now, however, a local shipbuilding industry has been established. Australia has constructed, and is in possession of her own ships. One of the richest and most far-reaching Combines in the world is the Shipping Ring. Honorable members would be recreant to their duty if they failed to endeavour to defeat that Combine. We should make this country independent of it. As the representatives of the people of Australia we should be prepared to meet these Combines. Great profits have been reaped from the sale of our primary products overseas. During the war as much as 2s. per lb. was obtained in the Old Country for Australian meat which, under contract made with the Imperial Government, was sold by us at 51/2d. per lb. We have had the same experience in regard to our wheat and metals. There are some honorable members in this House who claim to be the special representatives of the primary producers, but do nothing in their interests. Would it not be a good thing for the primary producer to know that his produce was being carried oversea by vessels, the freights in respect of which could be fixed by the people? During the war, while the London market was glutted with meat from Australia, Liverpool and other English ports were practically without supplies, but we had no control over the vessels that were carrying our produce overseas. In my opinion, all the shipping on the Australian coast should be the product of Australian workmen. I am a mechanic, and being unable at one time to obtain employment in my own trade I worked for twelve months in a ship-building yard in Australia. I found that the workmanship of the men in that yard was a credit to them. Experts indorsed that view. The Public Accounts Committee, when dealing with the Commonwealth shirbuilding scheme, made a tour of inspection, and many members of it were surprised at what they saw. The honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> who is a member of that Committee, and an enemy of Australian production, putting his foot down on everything Australian, got the surprise of his life when .he saw what was being done in connexion with the construction of marine engines here. We saw magnificent shafting, cylinders, rods, and slides being made. All such work can be carried out in Australia, but the honorable member is not prepared to encourage. Australian industry. </para>

            <para>- What is the good of endeavouring to encourage immigration if those who come here are to be mere hewers of w.ood and drawers of water ? The rising generation is above that sort of thing. Our young Australians are displaying a special aptitude and ability for carrying on the work of a progressive nation. We have some six different shipbuilding yards in Australia where ships can be constructed. In Sydney we have  Mort&#39;s  Dock and the Cockatoo Island dockyard. At Newcastle we have the Walsh Island works where, with a slight addition to the workshops, the keels of six vessels, of 12,000 tons each, could be laid at the one time. The Public Works Committee recommended that the Government, in carrying out its shipbuilding scheme, should lay down at least three keels at the one time. In Maryborough, Queensland, the Government has resumed land alongside Walker Brothers. The river there is very suitable for shipbuilding, and the land purchased will permit a ship to be launched without hindrance when she gets into the water. There is also a yard at Port Adelaide. While there are all these facilities for shipbuilding very little encouragement is given to the industry by Parliament. An endeavour is being made in some quarters, by persons interested in, or who are agents for, shipping interests&#39; on the other side of the world, to&#39; prevent ships being built in Australia. The time must come when Australia - this greater Britain of the Southern Seas - will hold a larger population than she holds now; She must prepare herself for that time, and one of the most necessary things to do at the present juncture is to build up the shipping industry. The shipping on the coast should belong to the Government, just as do the locomotives that run across the continent. This is an island continent, and there is no doubt that we have got to defend it. The first line of defence must be the Navy, and whether we use torpedoes, submarines, surface vessels, or flying machines, we must have the means of constructing them. The men engaged in shipbuilding can readily turn their attention to making&#39; flying machines. We have been told to-night that vessels can be purchased, for the coastal trade. Many such reports are inspired for the purpose of giving an excuse to the Government for not carrying on the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Many of the ships that can be purchased are not suitable for the Australian coast, or for navigating, Australian rivers. Unfortunately, many0 of the Australian rivers are barbound. The Clarence and the Tweed Rivers, at certain periods of the year, are very difficult to enter, mainly owing to the fact that the ships in use are not correctly, designed. Suitable vessels could be built in Australia. The ships that could be purchased do not comply with the Australian Navigation Act, and to alter them would be very expensive. If ships were built in Australia, and were owned and controlled by the Government, a mercantile fleet could be created which would be of inestimable benefit to this country in the event of international trouble occurring. It is impossible to make shipbuilders, like soldiers, quickly, by teaching them the &#34;goosestep,&#34; and how to handle a gun. I cannot understand some honorable members,&#34; who do not seem to realize that they are in a National Parliament, but behave rather as if they belonged to some little mutual admiration society. They have no idea, apparently, that they are here to work for the welfare of the nation. We, as public men, are expected to guide the people on the right path, and for that work we require political vision and energy. Nothing, however, is done; and here we are discussing, at this hour, &#39;business which ought to have been disposed of in half the  time. We should rise to the occasion, and not be timid and puny in the conception of our public duties. If honorable members opposite studied the history of other nations, they would soon see that they are making a great mistake in not supporting the party on this side in our aims and objects. We, from our surroundings and experience, have a firmer grasp of the needs of the country and the people than honorable members opposite. There must be a change of Government, and when the party on this side is in power, the reforms we agitate for will be carried into effect, and Australia will progress by leaps and bounds. Energy is the thing required on the part of public men at this period in our history, because all the ramifications of the relations between Parliament and people must be altered. There is discontent a.broad, and there will be still greater discontent unless Parliament is able and prepared to guide the people to something better ; and no country is better circumstanced for that great work than Australia. We now find attempts being made to prevent shipbuilding being carried on in Australia by throwing obstacles in the way of those who have entered into the industry. When the Public Accounts Committee inquired into this question, the members, of whom I am one, impressed on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat,</inline> of the Broken Hill &#34;Company, who is a man with a greater appreciation of the possibilities of Australia than is possessed by some honorable members, the necessity there was for the rolling mills to be set working so that plates might be provided for the ships to be built; and when the plates came to hand they proved to be better than any sent from. America or Great Britain. We ought not to be at the mercy of America, who, during the war, &#34; bled &#34; us in a way to make one shiver, although we hear so much about the peoples of both countries belonging to the same race. Wheat, which we&#34; sent to America at 3s. 4d., was sold there at 13s. and 14s., and so with other commodities. All this shows that we could not do better than construct our own shipping for our own trade on our own coast, and for carrying our products to the other side of the world. There are some honorable members who do not appear to have given much attention to these subjects; and, although the facte are there for all who care to look for them, we find it proposed, even at this time of day, to send money abroad to buy ships, although we have designers, material, and workmen superior to any elsewhere. I am an Australian, not by birth but by adoption, and my ambition is to make Australia the model for other countries. When the Labour Government, in 1910, established the Australian Navy the news created a sensation all over the world. There is no doubt that Australia is highly regarded for her democratic government and adult suffrage, and we can do good by showing that we refuse to be at the mercy of mercantile people, whom we cannot blame for bleeding us, seeing that we give them the opportunity. What I am trying to impress on my fellow-legislators is that we ought not to allow that opportunity to be given. In my opinion the Government have no fixed policy, and are not unanimous on the shipbuilding question. What was said in England of the Lloyd George Government may be said of this Government, namely, that it was not created by a solid party outside, but by circumstances which, here, were connected with an unfortunate incident in the party to which I belong. Owing to that incident Australia has suffered. Had the Labour Government been returned in 1913 with a working majority, Australia would have been saved millions of money. I shall be able, in discussing the Budget, to show that millions of money have been wasted by the Government in connexion with repatriation, in the building of War Service Homes, and in, other ways that are not creditable to them. We should build the ships necessary to conduct the trade around our coast, and to carry our products to the other side of the world, and should be no longer in the hands of the shipping people who treated us so badly during the war. If the present Government will not take this action, they will be replaced by a Government from this side, who will take good care that the shipping of Australia shall not be left in the hands of the people to whom I have referred. We have all the machinery and plant necessary for successful shipbuilding. Honorable members will find the most up-to-date machinery at Thompson and Company&#39;s works at Castlemaine, at Walsh Island, and at Walker Brothers&#39; works at Maryborough, in Queensland. In addressingmyself to a subject likethis, I may appear to be excited, but I am as cool as a cucumber, because I know that I am giving expression to Australian sentiments, and my opinions on this subject are shared by hundreds of thousands of intelligent Australians. As soon as the session is at an end, I shall make it my business to direct attention to the position into which this Parliament, and especially the Government, have fallen. &#34;When I look at the members of the Government, I am reminded of a minstrel troupe to which I belonged as a young man. I was principal cornerman of the troupe, and the other members were merely chairwarmers, and did what I told them. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is the cornerman of the Government, and until he comes into the chamber nothing can be done. I believe that if he were here to-night he would agree with the views I have expressed. &#34;We must have progress in Australia. We cannot be satisfied with what has already been done. The world moves, and we must move with it. </para>

          <para>,During the last years of the war and the period which immediately followed it, the shipwrights of Australia - Government and private - showed that they could build vessels which would compare in quality and in price with any built elsewhere. I, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, was fortunate enough to visit all the shipyards of Australia, and the work which I saw there was a credit to every one concerned. As only a small percentage of the men employed in those yards had had previous experience in shipbuilding, that was the more remarkable. The world then was prosperous, or seemingly so, a false prosperity having been induced by the free expenditure of Government money. Since then, however, conditions have changed. But the changes have not been so great in Australia as elsewhere. Consequently, to put a vessel in the water from an Australian shipyard now costs as much as, if not more than, it did two years ago. Overseas, however, men are working for lower wages than they were paid two years ago, and materials are costing less; so that these ships can be constructed at a lower cost than imme diately after the war. Still, it is not the cost of a vessel which decides its value; this is determined by its earning capacity. Freights have fallen the world over, and, the question we must ask ourselves is to what extent can we fulfil the promise - for it was practically a promise - under which we induced men to embark in shipbuilding. Men. were got to put their brains and their money and their labour into this industry, and to-day we have in Australia a number of shipbuilding yards that are well equipped. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and so longas Australia remains as prosperous as she is to-day, while our men are earning the wages that they are now receiving, and materials cost as much as they do, ships cannot be built here for less. The Committee is now asked to determine whether a duty upon ships built abroad shall lake effect in the beginning of 1923, 1924, or 1925. None of us know what conditions will prevail in any of these years, but, remembering the promise that we gave to those who have been induced to embark in this industry, and knowing that unless it receives encouragement, many yards must be dismantled, and the men employed in them lost to the industry, I am of the opinion that we should abide by the original determination to make the duty operate on the 1st January, 1923. If when that date arrives conditions have not changed for the better, it will be competent to still further defer the operation of the duty. I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> to stand by the first decision of the Committee. </para>

          <para>- As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts which investigated the shipbuilding industry, I had the opportunity of visiting all the shipyards engaged on the construction of vessels to the order of the Commonwealth Government, and, remembering the definite expressions of opinion of the then Minister for the Navy(Sir Joseph Cook) and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> it seems <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> if this Committee is in the act of deserting the men whom they urged to indulge in a shipbuilding programme by depriving them of that protection which is essential if the industry is to succeed. On 12th July, 1917, the Prime Minister pointed out the advantages to Australia of promoting shipbuilding, and said that his Government &#34; would take all the steps necessary for the immediate launching of the enterprise.&#34; I know that some honorable members will say that it is unreasonable to hark back to 1917, and that it is unfair to institute comparisons between the conditions then existing and those prevailing at the present time. It has been mentioned in this and in other debates that Australia is an island continent, and that the future history of this great Commonwealth will largely depend upon what Happens on our shores. We must of necessity become a maritime people, and if such is the case, why should we not embark in an industry so essential to any maritime power? Had it not been for my calm consideration of the feelings of honorable members, I would have endeavoured to have erected a stone wall round another item that was under discussion earlier in the debate. I believe in protecting every industry, and have endeavoured throughout the whole of our discussions on the Tariff to be consistent. We have now come to the second to the last item in the requests submitted by the Senate, and although I have been interested in most of the items, I know of no other industry that we have had to consider that should receive a greater measure of protection than that of shipbuilding. The cry has been raised by same members of the Country party that vessels can be purchased abroad at from &#163;7 to &#163;10 per ton, and that we have been paying up to &#163;30 a ton. Why do not those honorable members be fair in their criticisms, and quote the evidence submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts by experts, in which they said that we were actually constructing ships in Australia cheaper than they were being built in Great Britain? </para>

            <para>- That is quite possible. Many points have to be considered in instituting a comparison. It has been admitted that the workmanship on Australian vessels is equal, if not superior, to that performed in any part of the world. The Government have taken a prominent part in establishing this industry, and Parliament has supported them by voting money for carrying on the work. Leading hands have been brought from the other side of the world and have been placed in Government and private shipyards to train the younger men. Is this industry to tumble down likea house of cards? Are we to permit the grave injustice or make the awful blunder of allowing this great work to fall to pieces? I say, in all earnestness, God forbid that this Parliament should be guilty of such an act. We are not urging the Government to vigorously proceed with the shipbuilding programme, but this Parliament should certainly be urged to support the continuance of the industry. Honorable members on this side of the Chamber, including the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton),</inline> have said that the time may come again when we may have to request these people to come to our assistance. </para>

What is the Victorian State Government doing to-day? Only in last night&#39;s paper I read the reply of the Minister of Public Works to a deputation in regard to proposed im-provements at Westernport, where it is intended to expend a considerable sum in constructing a slipway. What for? Because it is understood that the shipbuilding industry is permanently established in Australia. The Committee of Public Accounts reported - </para>

          <para>Men skilled in shipbuilding were very scarce in Australia at the commencement of this undertaking, and a considerable proportion of the dockyard hands had to learn the work as they went along. But witnesses were unanimous as to the aptitude shown by the workmen employed, and the quick way in which they became expert. Inspectors and supervisors with experience in British yards unhesitatingly affirmed the quality of the work turned out by Australians. </para>

        <para class="block">These works have been established, and a fine band of workmen has been assembled. Arewe to listen to the doleful predictions of the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> and by adopting his suggestions throw all these men out of employment and destroy the industry? Let us consider the position of the industries which supply the raw material used in the construction of ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Delprat&#39;s name has been mentioned as one who did not require protection to carry on the iron and steel industry. He has now changed his mind. I can look on quite a number of honorable members who a few years ago were pronounced Free Traders; but the recent great world catastrophe has convinced them that Protection is absolutely essential in the interests of the Commonwealth. Why has this change been brought about? When we commenced shipbuilding we found that British rolling mills could not supply us with the necessary plates, because all they produced were required in the construction of the vessels being built in British ports. Certainly the United States of America came to our rescue, and we were able to import plates from there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat,</inline> the then general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, told a Committee of this Parliament that his company had established rolling mills for the production of rails, angle irons, and other steel products, hut up to that time had not incurred the expense of installing a plant to produce plates for shipbuilding. The intention of the company was to lay down the latest type of plant for that purpose, and thus make Australia selfcontained in regard to the construction of shipping. </para>

            <para>- What a blessing it would be to the Commonwealth if it were self-contained in this respect. It is the first duty of members of this Parliament to do for the shipbuilding industry what is essential, and what has been done in America and other coun tries. Does the honorable member for Swan imagine that, without help from the Government, the shipbuilding industry of the United States would have been able to go ahead to such an extent that American ships now carry a big proportion of the world&#39;s commerce? The honorable member for Grampians <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jowett)</inline> has complained of the producers being in the grip of the Shipping Ring. The position created by the shortage of shipping may be modified for the time being, but wipe out the Australian shipbuilding industry, dispose of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and withdraw the Commonwealth from the building and operation of ships, and the day will be not far distant when, not only the producer, but every man, woman, and child in Australia will be in the cast-iron grip of the Inchcape Combine that owns such a big proportion of British bottoms to-day. Are we to be sorecreant to the principles we once espoused as to desert an industry that to-day is upstanding andbecomingmore firmly established as the months go by? Are we imbued to even a limited extent with the idea of Australian nationalism? If we are we shall stand by an industry which may be said to be practically indigenous to the country by reason of the fact that the raw material required for it is produced locally. I confess that when a Committee of this Parliament visited the shipping yards of Walkers&#39; Limited, I and other members were pleasantly surprised by the magnificent specimens of workmanship which were shown to us. This Parliament has not yet given the shipbuilding industry a fair chance. </para>

          <para>, - This is a matter which should not be lightly dealt with. Coming from a city where 6,000-ton ships have been built for the Government, and where the work has been splendidly done, I wish to say that the contractors have been encouraged to take up the work in the belief that the Government would do everything possible to protect their industry, just as was done in connexion with the steel and other trades. It would not be fair to defer the protection until 1924, seeing that the shipbuilding yards have been established with heavy over-head expenses. In the meantime the staffs would be disbanded, and the works for some time rendered absolutely useless. I was informed by the manager of the steel works at Newcastle that, as there was every prospect of shipbuilding being continued, his company intended to spend &#163;200,000 in the erection of the machinery necessary to manufacture steel plates, which is, I understand, being done. We must realize the importance of shipbuilding, because we still need a large number of vessels either to be built here, or purchased outside Australia, to make up. the number engaged in the coastal trade previous to the war. We have not as many vessels now as prior to the war. </para>

There is nothing to prevent these business people ordering years ahead.

Yards have been established in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, but I am afraid there will not be much chance of having many ships built in any of them for many years to come. There is no formality about fixing upon the 11th November as the date before which vessels must have been ordered to escape the payment of theduty. There is no reason why we should not revert to the date on which the Senate made its request. It is certain that if we leave the date as the Minister proposes to fix it we shall be laying oursolves open to certain charges. However, I want to reply to some of the arguments that have been advanced by the other side. I admit that they are very thin, but nevertheless one must reply to them. Why does the Minister adhere to the 11th November as the date from which the duty shall operate? </para>

I do not know if any orders have been placed between the two dates mentioned, but, if so, the only effect of the duty would be to make the ships more costly, and to that extent we should be penalizing the community, because the increased cost would affect the overhead charges and be passed on to the community. </para>

            <para>- The Government have a right to extend the period of a deferred duty. If the circumstances are such, in July, 1923, that we cannot start building vessels here, the Government will he empowered to extend the period. That is to say, if the position is such that there is no chance of any keels being laid in Australia, no object will be served in penalizing people who may desire to purchase ships abroad. There is nothing I want more ardently than to see the shipbuilding industry established and flourishing in Australia. It is a vital national necessity, and we should do all in our power to assist in its thorough establishment. I believe that that objective will yet be achieved ; but, with the enormous amount of shipping tied up all over the world, it cannot be looked for today. No one can say what will happen by the 1st July, 1923; but, if the Committee will accept my proposal, with the qualification indicated, I will bring it forward at once. </para>

          <para>. - There is not anything acceptable in the Minister&#39;s &#39; offer. If he had not added his qualification, I would have been prepared to accept the amendment without reserve. The argument has been advanced that a duty should be imposed after a given period in order to provide local builders with an opportunity to catch any orders that may come along. The Minister is prepared to defer the imposition of the duty until July, 1923, provided that the Committee accepts the responsibility for a further extension of the period, if deemed necessary. If the Minister would undertake to shoulder the responsibility &#39; for that qualification rather than place it on the Committee, I would be more impressed. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Greene)</inline> is now proposing only to extend by six months the time within which it will be possible to bring in vessels free of duty. I think that extension may prove to be too short. As I pointed out when discussing this question at an. earlier hour, the raising of the capital necessary to purchase vessels for the north coast trade of New South. Wales has yet to be considered. I do not think that honorable members of the Labour party have sufficiently appreciated the point that the only effect of bringing this duty into operation earlier than is proposed by another place will be to add to the cost of bringing vessels here, because, as has been pointed out, the cost of building in Scotland, plus the duty, will probably be less than the actual cost of building in Australia. </para>

            <para>- And a new Parliament will review them. I would point out to honorable members that the inevitable result of increasing the cost of the vessels which carry the bulk of the produce from the. north and, south coasts of New South Wales to the various industrial centres for consumption will be an increase in the cost of living in those centres. Freights at present are very high, and if they are raised there will be a consequent increase in the cost of living in these industrial centres. I have been astonished to hear so many honorable members say that they cannot foretell what will be the position in regard to shipping twelve months hence. If there is one thing that indicates accurately what those engaged in the shipping industry may anticipate, it is the drop in the shares of shipping companies throughout the world. For instance, shares in the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company within the last eighteen months have fallen from &#163;700 to &#163;250, and are practically going down every day. </para>

            <para>- - They have had an opportunity to purchase hundreds of new ships at prices far below what they could hope to build them for, and their capital position is very much stronger than it was. The drop in shipping company shares has occurred practically throughout the world, so that it is easy to foretell what will he the position a year hence. I do not wish to delay the Committee any longer. In default of getting anything better, I am willing to accept the proposed modification of the request, bringing the duty into operation on 1st July, 1923,with the qualification stated by the Minister. </para>
