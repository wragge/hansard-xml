            <para>- I have read, with much regret, the press report that the Senate of the United States has decided to take a course in regard to the Panama Canal which seems clearly at variance with the treaty between that country and Great Britain, and affects our interests. I do not think that this is the time to discuss the matter. This Government has already expressed the views of the Commonwealth to the Mother Country, and asked to be associated with it in any protest that might be made. What has happened since serves to emphasize the opinion then expressed. We wish to be publicly associated with the Mother Country in a protest against the action taken, and we indulge the hope that the matter may not end with the decision of Congress. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that the value of the Panama Canal is in question! As the Senate&#39;s decision affects treaty rights, it cannot very well be discussed here. This Government will congratulate any and every Government that may open up the waterways of the world, and promote commerce. Undoubtedly, whatever may happen, the opening of the Panama Canal will be an advantage. </para>

            <para>- I have received from the Chamber of Commerce, at Cairns, a telegram in which it is stated that the new regulations appeared in the local news columns, were at once enforced, without regard to existing arrangements between labourers and. farmers, and that the bounty is withheld from farmers who were unaware that the new conditions existed. My correspondent says that the local Customs officers are unable to inform the farmers whether the regulations are applicable to both harvesting and ordinary work, and that, consequently, there is confusion among the labourers, and dismay amongst farmers. Will the Minister tell us how he proposes to end this confusion ? </para>

            <para>. - A notice of motion stands in my name to the effect that the representatives of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper should be excluded from the press galleries of this House until such time as an apology is made for misrepresentation. I gave notice of the motion when I was smarting under what I thought to be a grave injustice. Since that time, the journal in question has apologized through its columns. The matter of which I complained appears to have been inserted in consequence of a mistake. Since I arrived in Melbourne to-day I have also had an interview with a representative of the newspaper, and can plainly see how the error crept in. As the mistake was committed unintentionally, I have to request that I have leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

              <para>- This matter has been considered by two Conferences of  Deputy  Postmasters-General. It was reported that the expenditure incurred in sorting English mails between Fremantle and Adelaide would be very much greater than if done on the trains, and that the only advantage to be gained, even when the weather permitted the proper sorting of the mails between those places, would be a slightly earlier delivery in Adelaide, the sorting on trains giving quite as expeditious and satisfactory a service as could be gained by sorting at sea. In these circumstances, I do not consider it advisable to make any alteration in existing arrangements at present. </para>

              <para>Officers of all Divisions of the Public Service who are wholly or in greater part employed on indoor duties are required to work forty-four hours per week before overtime payment can be claimed. Payment for overtime is made at the rate of time and a quarter based on a day of eight hours. This is slightly lower than the hourly payment computed on a week of thirty-six and three-quarter hours, but overtime computed on the above hours, which are the minimum number per week, is not considered equitable. Officers have always been required to work extra time daily before being entitled to claim overtime, and on the weekly limit fixed, namely, forty-four hours, the payment per hour for overtime is not less than that received per hour for ordinary work. </para>

Quite recently a considerable quantity of it was sent away in an unsalted condition. That butter will be bought up by blenders on the other side of the world, and milk, and probably water, will be pumped into it.

          <para>.- There is a general impression, which I hope as unfounded, though there appears to be good ground for it, that the military authorities have not much sympathy with rifle clubs. That opinion is held very strongly by riflemen in Western Australia. They have complained bitterly that they do not even receive the same consideration which is extended to members of rifle clubs in other States. They complain especially that in the matter of rifle ranges they are treated with scant consideration, and generally have to take what is left after all other branches of the Defence Force have been attended to. I think that these Estimates show that there is something which justifies this complaint. I hope the Minister of Defence will give his attention to the matter. It will, I think, be agreed that this very desirable and useful branch of our Defence Force, composed as it is &#39;of mature men who take an enthusiastic interest in accurate rifle shooting should be encouraged to the utmost extent. I notice that, taking the Estimates as a whole, last year ,&#163;61,376 was voted for rifle ranges, and only &#163;22,504 was expended ; &#163;16,943 was voted for drill halls, and only &#163;3,799 of this amount was ex pended. In connexion with these two items, no less that &#163;52,016 was unexpended out of a total vote of &#163;78,319. Referring especially to Western Australia, included in the subdivision now under consideration, &#163;49,328 was voted last year, and only &#163;18,780 spent. Honorable members will see that the votes for rifle ranges and drill halls count for a considerable proportion of last year&#39;s vote. Under the subdivision, ;&#163;3&#176;&#62;548 of the amount voted last year was unexpended. For rifle ranges, &#163;11,665 was voted, and only &#163;801 spent, leaving &#163;10,864 unexpended. In the circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that riflemen should be discontented, and should feel that they are not receiving the consideration to which they are entitled. For drill halls last year there was &#163;5,531 voted, and of this amount &#163;5,156 was unexpended. I see that only &#163;3,783 is asked for this year under this heading, or less than the amount which remained unexpended from the vote for last year. We pass Estimates in this House, and that seems to be about the end of the matter, for the Department apparently does nothing. Last year &#163;2,700 was voted for three items - &#163;1,300 for a boatshed, &#163;800 for medical field equipment, and &#163;600 for a port war-signal, and not a penny of this money was spent. Then there was an item of &#163;1,409 for command telephones at Fremantle, and only &#163;89 of this vote was spent. In spite of this fact, only &#163;100 is asked for this purpose on these Estimates. It is evident that some one must have blundered. I see that &#163;1,029 was voted last year for a storeroom at the Tammin Railway Reserve, and only &#163;28 of this vote was spent. The Departments ask for money, and do not spend it when it is voted. They then ask for much smaller votes for the same purposes in the next year, and this shows that those concerned really do not understand what they are about. They do not appear to know what is wanted. I was told the other day that it is intended that all the rifle clubs in Australia shall be treated in the same way. All I can say is that they have not been treated in the same way up to the present. In some States members of rifle clubs receive railway passes, while in my own State of Western Australia they do not. A good deal is done to make provision for rifle ranges in some places, and very little in others. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to see that money is spent when it is voted. Nothing is so unsatisfactory as to induce people to believe that they are going to be given something and then not to give it to them. Rifle clubs should be treated with great consideration. They represent a branch of our Defence Force capable of great expansion and usefulness. Our defence system . is a system for the youth of the country up to the age of twenty-one, and to a smaller degree up to the age of twenty-five; the mature manhood of the country has no obligation for any service except in time of emergency. The mature manhood of the country must, therefore, be encouraged to take up the rifle club system and practice shooting. We know, however, that the riflemen are enthusiastic, and enthusiasm should be encouraged wherever and whenever found - in rifle clubs or in any other direction which tends to the good of the country. The Boy Scouts, for instance, are looked at askance by the military authorities; but those boys are enthusiastic, and will, I hope, eventually merge into the military system. I urge the Minister to take into consideration the matters to which I have drawn attention, and to see whether he cannot to a greater extent than in the past year see that the money voted for any year is expended in the directions intended during the year. </para>

          <para>. - I am glad that the honorable member for Swan has called attention to the question of rifle clubs. Some months ago an enthusiastic supporter of these clubs spoke to me about what he considered the damper that is. thrown upon them in South Australia by the military authorities, who do not seem to give the support that might be expected to what I think can be shown is a very good associated body in connexion with our Military Forces. I made a few notes on the matter at the time, though I do not intend to refer to them now except to say that it is somewhat significant that MajorGeneral Hutton, when he went back to England, after telling us that 45,000 troops in time of war and 25,000 troops in time of peace were sufficient, expressed his belief in the compulsory training of cadets as likely to lead to voluntary enlistment. In a speech which he made at the Isle of Wight, and which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 10th March, 1906, he recommended that the rifle club system should be encouraged as a means to the creation of a solid system of national defence. He believed that a national militia army provided the best means of defence under our Anglo-Saxon form of government ; and to this end he particularly recommended theencouragement of rifle clubs. I took the trouble at the time to consult the statistics relating to rifle clubs, and I found that in 1901, when we had a militia and volunteers of the total strength of 28,812, there was a rifle club membership of 32,833. We seem to have gone back by 1905, owing to the fact, if my memory serves me aright, that when we commenced our Fede1ral Defence Department with an expendsture of about ,&#163;890,000, we struck off &#163;196,000 the first year, without the slightest regard to the possible objective either of defence or offence, or to the proportion that should exist between the naval&#39; and land forces. In fact, we did this, as I mentioned at the time, in blind disregard of the fact that we had not settled on anydefinite policy. In 1903-4 we had almost reached the nadir in connexion with military matters, when the military expenditurewas only &#163;458,000. By 1906 there seems tohave been a little encouragement given to/ the rifle clubs, because the membershipthen was 37,000. In 1907, the then Minister of Defence, who was, I believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing, expressed the opinion that we ought to prepare for an armyreserve of 800,000, to be reached in nineor ten years by the annual training of 200,000. Subsequently this estimate was: brought down by Lord Kitchener to about 120,000 men. I have my own opinion on this question of conscription, but I do not intend to enter into the matter now, though I may have an opportunity on a subsequent occasion. In that year, when the Deakin Government was in power, some encouragement was given to rifle clubs; and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Ewing stated that the total force, including .rifle clubs then amounted to 68,000 men, including a club membership of 48,000. My purpose is served if I call attention to the fact that there is an opinion abroad that the military authorities desire uniformity to the exclusion of everything else. This is characteristic of military men, though it does not follow that they will stick to the one line of development they have adopted, because none vary so much as they. Without speaking too strongly, we may say that the military authorities do not seem to be affording that enthusiastic encouragement to the youth of the country to join rifle clubs that ought to accompany the development of our Military Forces. </para>

          <para>.- The question of rifle clubs is one that should be earnestly grappled with by whatever Government may be in power. This is not a question of making grants to clubs in the general expectation that increased grants will bring increased political support. It is a question of what is owing to the country as well as to the rifle clubs - of how to properly encourage Australia to take an interest in rifle shooting, and, at the same time, to make the rifle club organization fit in with the general purposes of the Defence Department. My own view is that the riflemen of Australia are only too anxious to fit in harmoniously their skill and patriotism with the necessities of the Department; to help in the training, especially in the direction of musketry, of the levies that are being made under a system of compulsory training. But the Defence Department is not treating the rifle clubs well ; it is not even treating them fairly. The Department is, apparently, coquetting with them ; and, at the same time, ignoring them when they come half way to meet the Department. For instance, a week or two ago - since when I have been absent through ill health - I gave some information to which I once more direct the attention of the Minister. I cited instances where the Defence Department had been, on two separate occasions, in communication with rifle clubs ; and in one of these cases when the rifle clubs actually came forward and enthusiastically agreed to do what the Department desired, the whole matter was pigeon-holed and left in abeyance. That is not the way to encourage and bring within still more useful confines an invaluable movement like that of the rifle clubs - it is the way to kill it. The present Ministry is, in my opinion, deserving of a certain amount of censure, inasmuch as they have either permitted this state of affairs, or have not taken sufficient steps to prevent such things occurring. I suggest that the Minister take an early opportunity to go into the whole matter. </para>

            <para>- As the honorable member knows, in Defence matters I have no regard for party. What I say is that, in this particular case, the Ministry is to blame for either one thing or the other ; cither they have connived at the present state of affairs, or they have not been keen enough to prevent it arising. I hope it may be found to be merely a lack of keenness ; and that some real anxiety will now be shown by the Department to avail itself of the patriotism and skill contained in our rifle club organization. </para>

        <para>I take this opportunity to refer to a matter on which information has been, I am afraid, denied to me and the country. I refer to the item of &#163;80,000, under the head of &#34; Various States and Federal Territory,&#34; for the acquisition of sites for and the erection of mobilization store buildings and drill halls for the Defence Department. I think I may properly refer here to a piece of departmental maladministration during the course of the present year with regard to a proposal to transfer the Victoria Barracks from Paddington to Double Bay. For a long time the Paddington Municipal Council have wanted - and every honorable member who has studied their case must sympathize with ft - the Commonwealth either to shift the Victoria Barracks from the municipality or to make them some payment in lieu of the rates which the Commonwealth would have had to pay for municipal services rendered, but for its constitutional exemption from taxation. The Government said, in reply to the municipality, that if they could be given a site in some other place equally suitable for military purposes, and at equal cost, they would be delighted to make the desired transfer. The next thing we know is that General Gordon, whose opinion was asked on the matter, strongly resisted any proposal to leave the Victoria Barracks. He stated that the site was one of really very great value.  His  exact words appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I do not wish to weary honorable members by quoting them again. He pointed out most clearly, and in the most unequivocal language, that, from the departmental view, it was absolutely essential to retain the Victoria Barracks at Paddington. Then there appears on the papers which I hold in my hand a minute from the Minister directing General Gordon to inquire about a site for barrack purposes in Double Bay. The Minister&#39;s direction was very vague. It gave no indication of how the matter originated. It simply directed General Gordon to make a report on this question. He took his orders from the Minister - he looked into the matter. It is very singular that on a matter of such importance, involving, according to those interested, an expenditure amounting to  &#163;120,000,  but which, with proper esti mates of depth of water, and so on, would have landed the Commonwealth in an outlay of at least  &#163;250,000,  General Gordon, forgetting his previous report, with the greatest expedition recommended this new proposal. What are -its advantages? The Minister, who is taking upon his own shoulders now the whole responsibility in order to shield a man prominent in the Labour movement outside, says, and wishes the House to believe, that he had himself set before General Gordon the advantages of this proposal, and possibly that is <inline font-style="italic">why</inline> General Gordon changed his opinion with extraordinary speed - in a fortnight ! The alleged advantages beggar description they are ludicrous. Let me give some of the advantages for which the Minister wishes to take the fullest responsibility. He says that we will save rent. How shall we save rent if we incur a capital expenditure of  &#163;250,000?  It means that the interest on this enormous charge is going to be the rent. The Minister says that offices and other places will be concentrated. _ They are already concentrated in the Victoria Barracks, far more so than the exigencies of the Department require, because it is decentralization more than concentration which is needed under the area system. The next alleged advantage of this proposal is that it will provide access to the forts by water. Why, every fort in Sydney already has access to the water ! An expenditure of  ^&#163;250,000  in Double Bay is not required to give access by water to the forts surrounding the heads in Sydney. Other alleged advantages of the proposal are said to be the saving of expense on cartage, wharfage, and handling, the better supervision of a number of things, and that all stores for camp can be lightered to the various places. Why can they not be lightered at the port in&#34; Sydney, instead of being lightered to Double Bay, handled, and put back on board a train in Sydney? Again, we are told that in the event of an expedition to the Northern Territory stores can be placed directly on board the steamer. Did any one ever hear anything so ridiculous as that ? The great city of Sydney, with a population of half-a-million, and the biggest shipping south of the line, is unable to provide sufficient wharf accommodation for ships bound to the Northern Territory, and it is, consequently, necessary for the Commonwealth to Buy private properties in Double Bay, and reclaim land at an expense of about  &#163;250,000.  We are also told that drill grounds can be obtained at Double Bay, and that the site is handy to the forts. A number of places are handy to the forts, but we do not wish to obtain them. It is stated, too, that the site is equally close to Sydney as the Victoria Barracks. It is also claimed that it is safe from bombardment j so is Yass-Canberra. Now, that stamps the reply of the Minister as a piece of humbug - endeavouring to take the responsibility on his own shoulders, because we know that he is a sensible man. He would not, looking at the thing from the Commonwealth p6int of view, himself put forth anything so utterly ridiculous and silly on behalf of the site. </para>
        <para> The plans and estimates give this proposal a still more sinister appearance. In estimating the cost of reclamation, the depth of water is, of course, a matter of enormous importance. But what do we find here? The depths of water given in the plan are actually less than the depths of water shown on the Admiralty chart, and, to my knowledge, a great deal less than the depths of water in the bay. I was bred there, and, as a boy, I sailed boats there very often. The depths shown on the Admiralty chart are the lowwater depths. When a man thinks of reclaiming land, it is necessary to go some 5 feet above high-water mark in order to get an estimate of the amount of filling-in which will have to be undertaken. That item is grossly underestimated, and, remembering the secrecy with which the whole matter has been covered up, I consider this most sinister. The Committee is entitled to the fullest information as to how and why the proposal originated. Whoever got it carried into effect would have made a bit of money. The properties that were to be resumed are of great residential value, among them being one belonging to my own family. It was largely because a person - myself - interested in a place known to be for sale came to the Department of Home Affairs, and told them that the thing was a swindle, that it was stopped. That the Minister has practically admitted in this chamber, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Now, when a man has a large residential property for sale which cannot be sold easily, he is prepared to give a pretty high commission to any one selling it. For that reason I have asked - and I have been refused - -information as to the prices put upon these properties by their owners. If a property can be bought by a private individual for, say,  &#163;16,000,  and is under offer to the Commonwealth for  &#163;30,000,  it is a matter of considerable public importance that the fact should be made known. Why should Ministers keep these facts secret? </para>

          <para>Y. - I only want the information. There would have been some large commissions had this project been carried out. Furthermore, there would have been occasion for a vast amount of filling in, which would have necessitated the use of a number of dredges, which would have had to be bought from some one who sells dredges, who would have made money in that way also. I know as well as the Minister who it was originated this proposal which the honorable gentleman, with his hand on his heart, says originated in his own brain. If the connexion with this matter of the most prominent man in the Labour movement for many years, of the man who was leader of the Australian Labour party a few years ago, is one of which my honorable friends are proud, why cannot they say that he brought the matter before them ; that the proposal originated in their ex-leader? </para>

          <para>Y. - The Minister of Home Affairs did not know anything about it. He told me that he had not seen the papers when I first went to his Department about this matter. There was such despatch that, no sooner had the papers reached his Department, than they were sent to Sydney, before he had even seen them ! The Minister of Home Affairs had nothing to do with the matter ; it was a Defence Department job. </para>

          <para>Y. - I doubt whether he would care to explain it now, since the Minister of Defence, in an effort to shield a brother politician outside Parliament, has taken the whole responsibility on his own shoulders. The Minister of Home Affairs does not wish to give the Minister of Defence the lie on a matter involving such an immense expenditure of public money. </para>

          <para>Y. - He has made, through his representative in this Chamber, the statement that the proposal originated &#34;in his own mind, as the result of private inquiries he made in Sydney. This is a very important question, and I do not labour it simply to put my honorable friends in a difficulty. I asked for the information in the first place, and expected to get it, but it has been denied. The Minister now says that he has given all the information that he will give as to the origin of the proposal. I have made public the information which has been denied, and I challenge Ministers -to give me a Select Committee to inquire on oath as to the origin of this proposal. </para>

          <para>Y. - The proposal to expend ^250,000 on the most ridiculously foolish and dangerous project that has ever been put forward by a Works Department in Australia may well be characterized as funny. It is useless for Ministers to say .that the Minister of Defence thought of this stupid thing himself. Considering his knowledge of Sydney, of the properties for sale there, and of their value, it is useless for him to say that he thought of this thing himself. He must say who did it. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> was interested in the early stages of this proposition. Whether it originated with him, or with the owner of the property, is another matter. </para>

There is not a single person an Sydney who would suspect for a moment that the Minister of Defence would be aware of what properties were for sale there, or of what depth of water was available in the hundreds of bays to be found in Sydney harbor. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> was interested in the earlier stages of the proposal.

It emanates from the Department of Home Affairs, where there does not appear to exist the same extraordinary desire for secrecy. The Director of Works in New South Wales was asked to submit a report in a paper headed &#34; Confidential.&#34; When that report gofto the Department of Home Affairs the matter became above-board, and this paper is consequently on the file.

Will the Minister tell us what has already been spent, and to what extent the proposed expenditure goes towards the completion of buildings? What is the total expenditure up to date ? A third item bundles together a number of details - &#34; Naval colleges, naval barracks, submarine depot, naval, gunnery and torpedo school, naval training schools, sites and buildings.&#34; On what sites are these buildings proposed to be erected? A footnote informs us that the expenditure of  &#163;50,000  is in addition to  &#163;40,000  contributed from the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> fund. I presume that the Naval College at Jervis Bay is included, but I should like to obtain details. </para>

          <para>ON.- But we may reasonably object to the expenditure of a large sum of money upon a place which is ostensibly intended only for the temporary &#39; housing of the trainees. When a naval expert was appointed to designate a suitable place for the establishment of a naval school Osborne House was not reported upon favorably. I think that sound objections were made to it, and that the site considered most advantageous was at Burraneer Bay, Port Hacking. Osborne House was considered unsuitable. </para>

          <para>ON.- I shall have an opportunity of re-perusing the report to refresh my memory. I know that reports were made by Captain Chambers on several suggested sites, and that the one at Burraneer Bay was preferred over all others. The Minister of Home Affairs also spoke in the most eulogistic terms of that site. Everything was going on swimmingly and  Colonel Miller,  or some other officer, was sent to inspect the place. All the reports were most favorable. The Prime Minister, when questioned, also referred to it as the best site in the Commonwealth. Notwithstanding all these eulogies, the site was ultimately turned down, because of the pressure of Victorian members supporting the Government, and others outside. </para>

          <para>ON. - The statement I made was that the site at Burraneer Bay had been approved, and every honorable member knows that that is so, and the honorable member himself knows it, and can see it recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of a few short months ago. The negotiations had actually gone to the extent of valuing the territory for the purpose of its acquisition. The Minister of Home Affairs told us that he was going to acquire the site, and the Prime Minister said that the Government were going to&#39; take it over. Then some of the owners of the land objected to its being taken from them, and their action assisted the Victorian section in an agitation against the selection of any site that was not in the Federal Territory. They urged that the College must not be established anywhere save in Federal Territory, and that was the plea on which the site at Burraneer Bay was turned down. At that time there was no talk about the Geelong site. It was urged that the College should be established in the Federal Territory, and a site was selected there, but that was not what the Victorian members wanted. Notwithstanding all their talk about &#34; a broad national outlook,&#34; notwithstanding their contention that all Federal establishments should be erected in Federal Territory, they really desired that they should be established in and around Melbourne, and, after all, Geelong, figuratively speaking, is only a biscuit&#39;s throw from this city. As soon as the Government, taking these honorable members seriously, decided ultimately to turn down the New South Wales site, and to establish the Naval College in Federal Territory at Jervis Bay, what happened ? By some peculiar process of working unknown to the Opposition </para>

          <para>ON. - We have heard a good deal of the undergrounding of the telephone wires, and I think that some wireless communication must have reached the Government through the same channel, inasmuch as it was suddenly announced that they were going to establish a temporary Naval College at Osborne House, Geelong. When that announcement was made, did we hear anything from these honorable members regarding the necessity for taking &#34; a broad national outlook &#34; ? Not a word. Did we hear any of them say that the College must be established in Federal Territory ? Not one. As long as it was to be established in Geelong they were satisfied. The Government could erect every factory and institution required by the Commonwealth at Geelong without hearing a word from these honorable members about the necessity for taking a &#34;broad national outlook.&#34; &#39;The more money we expend upon these temporary premises, the stronger will be the argument later on for their permanent use as a Naval College. The honorable member for Bourke, speaking in this House on  7th  November last, said, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Vol. LXI., page  2295- </para>

        <para>That was a reference to the site near Port Hacking, to which I have already alluded. Although that site was reported upon as the most suitable for the purpose, the Government, yielding to the various opinions expressed by some of their supporters, and the .pressure of Victorian criticism from some other quarters, turned it down, and said that they would establish the College at Jervis Bay. The last thing that these Victorians desired, however, was the provision of this, or any other Federal requirement, in Federal Territory. What they desired was the spending of money in Victoria. The present proposal was then brought forward. Certain influences were at work, the result of which was that Osborne House was ultimately selected on the plea that it was necessary to establish a temporary College. On that plea, the Geelong site was selected, and the Government now propose to spend more money on it. The Estimates do not show how much is to be spent. </para>

          <para>ON.- When this money has been expended to fit this building for the use to which it is to be temporarily put, we shall find that, as soon as a proposal is made to remove the trainees, honorable members who are so ready to declare that this expenditure should be in Federal territory will argue that it would be a pity, since so much money had been expended on this building, to allow it to go for nothing. That will be used as an argument to keep Osborne House in permanent occupation as a Naval Training College. I have no doubt that is what is intended. I shall oppose this item. We have had no reasons submitted for the expenditure of this money on premises of a temporary character. It would be far more to the purpose to vote the amount asked for to secure the more rapid completion of the permanent Naval Training College at Jervis Bay. Money must be spent for this purpose, and it should be spent where the College is ultimately to be established. We should not fritter away thousands of pounds on temporary establishments in and around . the temporary Seat of Government. Another matter about which I should like to have some information is the works at Westernport. I understand that some of this money is to be expended at Westernport. </para>

          <para>ON.- It would be very much more satisfactory if the detailed items were set out, so that we might know what we are voting for. I think that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence should be supplied with a statement of the details of this proposed expenditure. Apparently the honorable gentleman has not the information which honorable members require to justify their action in voting the large sums of money required for these works. If, when our constituents ask us what this money was voted for, we are unable to tell them, we shall be placed in a very unsatisfactory position. They have sent us here to represent them, and they will be justified in saying that we have been very careless in dealing with the finances of the country if we have voted money for purposes of which we are entirely ignorant. I do not say that we should have details of every item of expenditure proposed, but we should know the nature of the works upon which _ the money is to be spent. There is another item to which reference might be made - &#34; Woollen Mills - Acquisition of Site, and Construction of Building - Towards cost, &#163;8,000.&#34; Where are these mills to be established ? There is nothing in these Estimates to supply that information. The item is included under the heading &#34; Various States and Federal Territory.&#34; Are we to have woollen mills established in several of the States and in the Federal Territory, or are they to be established at one spot in a particular State? </para>

          <para>ON.- I ask the Minister to say whether that is so. Will he tell the Committee what is the estimated total cost of the aquisition of the site and the erection of the mills. The vote now under consideration is only a vote on account, and gives no hint of what will be the ultimate cost under this heading. These woollen mills, again, should be established in Federal territory. Why does not the honorable member for Corio, who views these matters from a &#34;broad national standpoint,&#34; raise his voice against the establishment of these mills at Geelong? Here is the honorable member&#39;s opportunity. I should have expected him to say, in dealing with this vote, &#34; I had not the slightest idea that this item \v.as on the Estimates. I am amazed to find that it is proposed to spend this money in my district. I am not a provincialist, but a nationalist. From the broad national point of view, therefore, I ask that this item should be struck out of the Estimates, and the money expended in the Federal Territory, in acordance with my previously expressed principles.&#34; If all the Victorians have a &#34;broad national outlook,&#34; surely the honorable member will not let that outlook be bounded by the confines of Corio Bay. I cannot believe that he belongs to that parish pump type of politician whose views are so circumscribed. Let us see whether there is that patriotism in his composition about which we have heard so much, and whether he is statesman enough to rise to the occasion, and demand that these works shall be placed in Federal Territory. I await with expectancy the speech of the honorable member, in order to learn how far his patriotism and nationalism extend, and how much sincerity there is behind this cry we have heard so frequently and so loudly from the Victorian section about taking a &#34; broad national outlook&#34; in regard to this public expenditure. I have read the report submitted, and it seems to me that there has not been sufficient inspection of the Federal Territory by the expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smail</inline> ; that a number of districts within the Federal Territory which are suitable for woollen mills have net been visited by him. Before this money is expended, there ought to be more complete investigation, in order that we may have a more reliable report on which to form1 a judgment. The claim that there is not sufficient water in the Territory is absolutely discounted by the records of the gauges of the various rivers, which show an abundant supply for electric lighting, the domestic use of a large population, and all other purposes. There is not only one source of supply, but several, seeing that there are six or eight rivers and watercourses ; and to suggest that there is a scarcity is a view which cannot be substantiated by other reliable engineers&#39; reports in possession of the Committee.

            <para>- Those ideas of the honorable member have no foundation in fact. So far as I can gather, the honorable member has been given some information by a certain person, or persons, whom he point-blank refused to name this afternoon when asked. The Ministerial position can be very shortly stated. There are barracks at Paddington, New South Wales ; and the Paddington Municipal Council, for a considerable time past, has been urging their removal. </para>

Much correspondence has taken place, all of which is on the file, and all of which has been in the hands of the honorable member for Wentworth for a considerable time. That honorable member has submitted certain questions, the whole of which have been as fully replied to as it is possible for the Minister ot Defence to reply to them. Some few months ago, when the Minister of Defence was in Sydney, he was, as pointed out in some of the replies given, in conversation, I believe, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Flowers,</inline> a member of the State Ministry; and this question is a public one, all over New South Wales, at any rate. Some third person happened to be present at this interview, and overheard a portion of the conversation; and that person is stated by the Minister to have said in casual terms, &#34; If you are thinking of making an alteration there appears to be a good property known as Redleaf.&#34; </para>

          <para>S.- Not that I know of - no. It was a casual reference to the property. Some report has been furnished by the State Commandant, and is amongst the papers, all of which the honorable member for Wentworth has had access to. There the whole matter ends. I desire to say again that there has been no secrecy, and no withholding of papers. Even confidential papers, which are not generally laid on the table of the House, have been placed at the disposal of the honorable member for Wentworth, and his questions have been frankly replied to. The name of the third person who happened to be present, and casually mentioned Redleaf, has not been given to the honorable member; and the Minister of Defence accepts full responsibility for witholding it. </para>

Not a penny has been expended, no guarantee of expenditure in any shape or form has been made by the Minister. He has not proposed to do anything in the matter up to the present moment, further than in a general sense to say, as I mentioned before, that if the Paddington Council can place the Federal Government in exactly as good a position in respect to sites, barracks, and buildings as they now occupy at Paddington, he will favorably consider the proposal, which has been made for many years. </para>

          <para>S.- I understand all that. The Minister permits me to make a brief reference to some remarks without any connexion with the item respecting drill halls under immediate consideration. On Friday the Ministry were charged with not erecting a sufficient number of drill halls. There was a general complaint about laxity or indifference in this matter. The item before the Committee provides for the expenditure of money on the erection of drill halls. But, as honorable members will understand, it is impossible for us to say precisely where every drill hall will be erected during the next year. At the same time, it is essential that the Minister should be in a financial position to erect a drill hall the very moment that its necessity has been pointed out and a site located. </para>

          <para>S.- It is impossible for me to answer the question. The sites for the drill halls have not yet been selected, but the general policy of the Ministry is to protect the lads from inclement weather, to keep them as far as possible away from the streets, as well as to insure that the drilling shall be more effective and the instruction better given. The very moment that sites are selected, and the necessary specifications and plans are provided, drill halls will be erected in particular places. </para>

          <para>S.- I should say that the Minister necessarily would. Personally, it is of no consequence to him whether a drill hall is erected in Western Australia or in the division of Richmond. If the exigencies of the case demand that the latter shall be given the preference, I have not the shadow of a doubt that the Minister, being absolutely impartial, will readily fall in with an arrangement in that direction. I hope that, in the circumstances, honorable members will recognise that the Minister is not asking for a penny too much for this purpose. </para>

          <para>. - What I do not quite understand about these Estimates is that, while a large amount of the money for expenditure on drill halls is itemized, we are now asked to vote a lump sum of  &#163;80,000  for the erection of drill halls anywhere. I do not suggest that there is anything wrong in the amount, or in the method of presenting the Estimates, but we are asked to vote a sum for a drill hall here and a drill hall there, and then to vote a lump sum for drill halls anywhere. </para>

          <para>K.- It seems to me that the Minister&#39;s explanation does not quite fit the facts. I know one or two cases where there are large improvements asked for in rifle ranges, and all sorts of expenditure have been required and promised There is no allusion here to these matters, but, as to other places, we find the items set out in full detail. It seems to me tobe an unusual way of presenting this large vote. I suggest to the Honorary Minister that he might take a note of this criticism for the preparation of the next Estimates. </para>

          <para>K.- I object to this Government preferring one citizen over another. I say that unequivocally. Every citizen is in this union. Every citizen pays into its funds, and takes responsibility for it, and, therefore, no preference of one member of this union over another member of the same union should be given. As to the criticism of the Honorary Minister of the remarks of the honorable member for Wentworth, I do not hesitate to say that, were I as intimately associated with one of the sites as he is, and were it, in addition, in my electorate, I should feel bound to probe the matter to the bottom. He believes that an examination of the water adjoining the proposed site will show that it is unsuitable, and asks the pertinent question : Who proposed the acquisition of the site? The Minister has produced the papers, but on them there is no suggestion as to who first brought the matter forward. There are one or two points which merit attention. Brigadier-General Gordon would not look at the site at first, but a few weeks later reported it to be admirable for the purpose required. He knew the site all the time and the locality. </para>

          <para>K.- The existence of the Victoria Barracks in Paddington is an old grievance, and if another site equally serviceable can be obtained, the sooner the Paddington site can be given up the better. It is not quite proper that a barracks should be situatedin a populous suburb, where land is extremely valuable, and if equal facilities can be provided elsewhere, it will be the duty of the Government to surrender the present site to the local authorities, so that the development of Sydney may not be retarded. </para>

          <para>K. - No doubt. The Minister is right in saying that the Department must not be put to inconvenience, and its work must not be fettered or hindered by any removal. Those seem reasonable conditions. The. proposal was made that the property known as Redleaf should be acquired. I understandthat the honorable member for Wentworth has mentioned the names of private individuals in connexion with this matter.  His  remarks indicate that the thing is not quite as simple as the Honorary Minister would have us believe. The honorable member for Wentworth would not make statements which he had not ground for thinking to be correct. </para>

          <para>K.- If the facts are as stated, the fullest and most searching inquiry is needed. It all comes of the Minister not having replied frankly, plainly, and fully to the honorable member&#39;s question as to who are at the bottom of the proposed exchange, which would not be to the advantage of the Department. That is what needs probing. For the rest, I commend the Minister for his attitude regarding the barracks. It is the attitude that I and every other Minister of recent years has adopted. We have said, &#34; So long as the work of the Department is not impeded, if a site equally good for our purposes is found, we are willing not to stand in the way of the development of Sydney.&#34; The Minister should keep an open mind. He should not tie himself down in any way to any particular proposal. I know that it is difficult to get a piece of land which is equally good for our purposes. </para>

          <para>K.- That is a matter the final determination of which may very well be left till all the facts are available. The Minister should not commit himself to any course of action until the complete proposition is before him. He will then weigh one fact against another. He will consider the interests of the Commonwealth as the owner of the land, the relationship of the Commonwealth to the municipal authority, and also its relationship to the new site which has been offered. The question of finance would only come into the final adjustment of the matter. It is one of those questions which do not need to be treated in a merely business spirit. So many factors will operate that the Minister will do well not to commit himself beforehand, except to the broad principle that he does not wish to stand in the way of the development of the city so long as the work of his Department is not impeded. </para>

          <para>N. - If the site is to be given to the Commonwealth, where is the necessity for the item? Some explanation other than that we have received appears to be necessary. At Liverpool, in my own electorate, there is a site which is a Commonwealth property, and where the Government could have had water free for all time. I am of opinion that the country could have been saved the expense of sending the expert all over Australia. His inspection has been a farce. Two sites in Queensland were brought under the notice of the Minister some time ago, and the representatives of the districts in which they are located were informed by him that the expert would probably report upon them. They were given that information upon a date subsequent to that upon which his report had been completed, and forwarded to the Minister. These facts justify me in saying that the whole matter appears to have been fixed up beforehand. Consequently, I shall support the striking out of the item. </para>

          <para>T.- Oxford-street is woodblocked, whereas Oatley-road and Green&#39;sroad are merely asphalted and kerbed and guttered on both sides. I assure the honorable member that I can look after the interests of East Sydney without assistance from anybody else. I know the she which has been suggested for the barracks at Double Bay very well. I have no hesitation in affirming that by purchasing a portion of the landed property there, and by reclaiming an area which is now under water, we could make one of the finest parade grounds to be found in any part of the world. Such an undertaking would also provide facilities to persons on the other side of the harbor to cross over to the south side by water. </para>

          <para>T. - The great objection to the proposed site is that it is not in the centre of population. The barracks that we require for our Permanent Forces ought to be as near to a centre of population as possible, because we have also to consider our cadets, the ambulance corps, and the nursing corps, all of whom have to travel backwards and forwards to a particular place to receive their training. If the barracks are to be removed from their present site - and I Know that is the desire of the electors whom I represent - they ought to be removed to a centre of population so as to afford the best possible facilities to compulsory trainees. However, I believe that the Government do not intend to go on with the project which was mentioned by the honorable member for Wentworth, whom I should have liked to have been present. </para>

          <para>T. - I am sorry to hear that, and I regret his absence from the chamber. I am afraid that some are more anxious to devise an electioneering dodge than to look after the interests of the country. Coming to another matter I dare say that many New South Wales members will be astonished at the attitude I take up in regard to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. But I have no hesitation in saying that if I had been in the position of the expert appointed to inquire into this matter I should have reported in exactly the same fashion as he has done. He puts the case very plainly, and no honorable member who is not biased, or actuated by party feelings, will hesitate to come to the conclusion that his report is based on practical knowledge. It is said, that the Woollen Mills should have been located in the Federal Territory. As a man who has&#39;been acquainted with sanitary engineering all his life, I say, without hesitation, that there is no place within the Federal area where woollen mills could have been erected. </para>

          <para>T. - The refuse and drainage from a mill of this description require to be removed so that they may not become a source of injury to the lives of people. What system of drainage is capable of being carried out in the Federal area under present circumstances? Where are the habitations for the workers in the mills to occupy? We shall have to employ numbers of girls and youths who will have to be trained to the woollen industry. We could not get the necessary labour within the Capital area. I give the Government credit for their decision in this matter. They have determined that each of these Federal enterprises shall stand on its own basis. The manager has to show that he can manufacture woollen articles such as are required by the Defence Force, at a cost which is not in excess of that for which they can be manufactured by private firms. I believe the actual cost will be much lower, but the manager could not obtain such results if he has to overcome obstacles in the matter of labour and sanitation. Moreover, if the factory were established at the Federal Capital, there would be no facilities for conveying material to various portions of Australia when made up. No doubt honorable members opposite would be very glad to have the opportunity of showing that this Federal industry was a failure from the point of view of cost of production. But that is not our object. 1 have spoken as one who has been returned to this Parliament to devote such abilities as he has to the service of my country. I believe the people of East Sydney will appreciate a member who looks to the country&#39;s interests first, and does not merely try to fly party balloons which will be pricked immediately after the election. </para>

          <para>T. - The honorable member for Parkes could not get the people of East Sydney to accept him at all events. Would he not like to have the &#34; opportunity of claiming that our so-called Socialistic schemes had proved a failure, as would be the case if the Woollen Mills were not established at a suitable site? The Minister of Home Affairs has shown sound business ability in adopting the expert&#39;s report. No Minister, indeed, with such a report staring him in the face could conscientiously have acted otherwise. Evidently the expert - whom I do not know - is well fitted for his position. He has brought sound knowledge to bear upon the problem, and has reported to the best of his judgment. I am not acquainted with Geelong. I have never been there. I have no personal interest in this matter, because I am well aware that there is no suitable site in East Sydney. But I believe that the Government have come to a wise decision. I am glad to know that the Government are in earnest in reference to the barracks at Paddington. The late Government did nothing in the matter. I have earned credit as being the only live member who has ever represented East Sydney, and who has got anything for the constituency. I believe that the Government are with me in the matter, and that, at the earliest moment, the barracks will be shifted, and the present area turned into one for business or habitations. I regret the exhibition which the honorable member for Wentworth has made over this subject. Those who look at it calmly will realize that what is proposed is wise. The Redleaf site might be made into a splendid one for the purpose without great cost. I know the shores of Sydney Harbor, and know the property well. I am aware that the Woollahra Council are up in arms on the subject, as are also the Paddington Council. Both fear that the roads in their districts will be much injured through the removal of material from one place to another. I quite sympathize with them in that respect. A number of gentlemen who have palatial residences in the neighbourhood of Redleaf are also concerned. The site is one of the most beautiful places in Australia. It is one of the finest residential parts of Sydney, and house-owners there fear that the building of a barracks in the district will destroy the value of their property. They are quite justified in drawing attention to that aspect of the matter, and I am prepared, as I am sure every honorable member is, to assist them. But f cannot use language strong enough to condemn this attempt, on the part of the honorable member for Wentworth, to try to belittle a gentleman who believes that he is doing something in the interests of the country. Presuming that that gentleman believed that he would be doing something in the interests of the Defence Forces by causing the present barracks to be removed to another site, he had a right to take action, and slurs should not be cast at him. Innuendoes should not be made to the effect that he took this action because he thought it would be of some financial use to him. Public questions should not be treated in that way. We should take a broader view of public matters. 1 hope that, instead of casting slurs upon each other in this House, we shall all try to work in the best interests of the people, and that honorable members will deal with possibilities, and not suggest impossibilities, with a view of endeavouring to create the impression that there is something dirty involved in the action of the Government. I am satisfied that there is nothing dirty in this matter, and honorable members ought not to resort to such tactics. Suggestions of such a character should be treated with contempt. If an honorable member has not obtained a truthful statement concerning any public question, he should not set out on a fishing inquiry, with a view of casting aspersions on others who are doing that which they believe to be in the best interests of the community. Parliamentary life would be greatly improved if honorable members refrained from making imputations that have no foundation in fact - imputations the making of which show that they have diseased minds, and are not fit to represent the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>. - I had not the privilege of hearing the speech made by the honorable member for Wentworth, to which such heated reference has just been made by the honorable member for East Sydney. The honorable member for East Sydney, according to his own statement, is so capable of looking after the affairs of his electorate that I do not propose to assist him in that work ; but I wish to point out the miserable failure of his attempt to whitewash his own action and that of the Government in connexion with the selection of a site for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. Although he protests that he is acting in the best interests of the country, and that he does not view these matters from a parochial stand-point, the electors of, not only East Sydney, but New South Wales as a whole, will want to know why various sites in that S:ate. which were submitted to the expert, were not examined by him. The honorable member for Nepean twice stated in this House that the Government expert was &#34; nobbled &#34; before he left Melbourne to make his inspection - that he was not permitted to make a full examination before he came to a determination as to the most suitable site. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; he said twice that the expert was &#34; nobbled &#34; before leaving Melbourne - that the matter was fixed up before he left this city. That is a very serious statement, especially when made by an honorable member supporting the Government. Are Ministers prepared to sit quietly under such a grave accusation coming as it does from one of their own members? The Government cannot allow to go by the board the charge made by one of their own supporters, that they &#34;nobbled&#34; this expert; that the whole matter was fixed up before he left Melbourne; that it was only a farce to send him on tour, and that he did not investigate sites which, in the opinion of many, are superior to that which has been selected. I support the honorable member in the view that it is a disgrace that the expert was not allowed to visit sites that were prominently brought before him. The Government have declared that their policy is to establish &#39; all Commonwealth factories and Federal institutionswithin the Federal Territory itself. It was in accordance with that principle that a site for the Naval College was selected at Jervis Bay. But in this case the Government expert was not even sent to inspect the Federal Territory. It is ridiculous for the honorable member for East Sydney to say that in a territory comprising  900  square miles it is impossible to find a place where the refuse from a woollen mill could be discharged. </para>

          <para>R. - Is it impossible tohave any drainage in the Federal Territory? I cannot understand why the honorable member should do an injustice to his own State and to the policy of his party by declaring that there is not in the whole of the Federal Territory a spot where the refuse from a woollen mill could be properly drained. Such a statement will not bear investigation. The honorable member supports the statement of the expert that he visited the Federal Territory, but I say that he did not do so; he visited only one portion of it. It is true, as the honorable member has said, that the expert visited Yass-Canberra, but he did not go to that portion of the territory which the Commonwealth Government insisted on taking over, with full sovereign rights, from the Government of New South Wales. He did not go within  150  or  200  miles of it, and it is therefore begging the whole question to say that he went to the Federal Territory to look for a site for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. The municipal authorities of Wollongong and the Progress Association at Port Kembla brought before the Minister the suitability of a site for the .woollen mills in that district, yet when the honorable member for Nepean and I saw the expert at the Commonwealth offices, Sydney - at a time when he could easily have inspected the proposed site there - he knew nothing about it. He did not even know that it had been brought before the Ministry. Why was that site overlooked? This fact appears to bear out the strong accusation made against the Government by the honorable member for Nepean, that the expert was &#34; nobbled &#34; before he left Melbourne. The honorable member for East Sydney referred to the difficulty in the way of securing workmen for the Woollen Mills at the Federal Territory, but if that line of argument is to be pursued we shall have no factories there whatever. </para>

          <para>R.- There is a good water supply there, and in the Federal Territory there is one of the best that is to be found. It is all very well for the honorable member, who is another provincial Victorian, to suggest a lack of water in the Federal Territory. Since the Territory came under the control of the Commonwealth, absolute tests carried out by the Home Affairs Department have more than justified the statements of the experts at the time we decided upon Yass-Canberra as the site for the Federal Capital. </para>

          <para>R. - I am repeating the words of the honorable member for Nepean. I have not the evidence on which to make a definite statement. Perhaps the Honorary Minister has evidence to prove that it was a fixed-up job. I have to depend on the statement of the honorable member for Nepean, and on the action taken by the expert. I understand that representatives of Tasmania have a grievance in connexion with this matter also, but I am able to say that when the expert visited New South Wales he did not inspect some of the sites brought under his notice, and he certainly did not visit the Federal Territory to see whether a suitable site for the purpose could be discovered there. </para>

          <para>R. - In view of the way in which the honorable member for East Sydney has given the interests of the State away, it is about time that something was said for New South Wales. The&#34; vote before the Committee covers expenditure for naval colleges, naval barracks, a submarine dep6t, and other purposes. I had not the privilege of hearing the statement by the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, but I understand that he did not refer to the permanent Naval Training College at Jervis Bay. I would ask the honorable gentleman to say now whether any of this vote is to be expended on the permanent Naval College at Jervis Bay, or whether the whole of it is to be expended on the temporary College at Geelong. </para>

          <para>R. - That can not be so, because there are other works included in the vote. I repeat that if none of this money is to be spent on the permanent College at Jervis Bay that will be a gross breach of faith on the part of the Government. In connexion with these matters, Ministers would appear to be merely the creatures of their environment. They are influenced in every matter by the fact that the Parliament meets in Melbourne. In the first instance, Geelong was selected as the site of the Naval Training College, and it was only after the visit of the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Home Affairs to Jervis Bay That that place was selected. They had never seen the place before. They had opposed the establishment of the College at Jervis Bay in the previous Parliament, but after visiting the place they were delighted with it, and considered it the finest site they had seen for the purpose. They would not at the time give a definite answer as to whether the College would be established there. They came back to Melbourne, and a Cabinet meeting was held. I have the result of that meeting in a letter from the Minister of Defence to the effect that the Naval College, both temporary and permanent, should be established at Jervis Bay. But a movement was started again in Victoria, with the result that Victorian influence was sufficiently strong to secure the establishment of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> temporary College at Geelong. So far as I can see, it is not the intention of the Government now to devote any of this money to the establishment of the permanent College at Jervis Bay. This is a departure altogether from the announced policy of the Government. The honorable member for South Sydney is as much annoyed about this breach of faith in connexion .with the Woollen Mills as is the honorable member for Nepean. I hope that these honorable members will not be advised by the honorable member for East Sydney, but will insist that before the Government establish the Woollen Mills at&#34; Geelong the expert shall be required to visit the sites which have been referred to in New South Wales, and also to visit possible sites in other States. I am not speaking specially for New South Wales, but for the Federal Territory. The woollen factory ought to be established within the Capital area ; or, if it be established outside, all the States should have a fair deal in the choice of the site. The expert ought to be so instructed by the Government before this expenditure is entered upon at Geelong, to visit the sites submitted to the Government. </para>

          <para>E. - It is all very well to say &#34;nonsense&#34;; but has the honorable member had the water analyzed or tested? The expert distinctly tells us that the water in the Territory is not suitable, whereas in Geelong it is known to be soft and adapted to the manufacture of woollens. Further, in Geelong there is a permanent supply, not only from a reticulated service, but from the river. Of course, in winter time there is an abundant supply of water at Yass-Canberra, but in the summer the rivers become a mere series of waterholes. </para>

The mills are to be established in North Geelong, on a site which is about a mile distant from the post-office. North Geelong is surrounded by large green paddocks where it will be possible for the Government to build houses and to treat the employ?s in a generous way.

          <para>.- It is not of very much use to appoint experts to report upon various sites for the construction of a clothing factory, or naval college, or anything else, because we find that they are either &#34; nobbled,&#34; or their expert advice is absolutely disregarded. With regard to a site for the clothing factory we are told that the expert was &#34; nobbled &#34; before he left Victoria, and we know, as a matter of fact, that he did not visit many very suitable sites in New South Wales. Many of the arguments which have been brought forward against establishing the Woollen Mills at Yass-Canberra have been quite ridiculous. For instance, the honorable member for East Sydney said that it could not. possibly be established there because there was no drainage. If the plans and specifications are drawn out for the erection of a great city in the Federal Territory surely there must be plans drawn out too for sewerage, and drainage. We know, of course, that a sewerage and drainage scheme must be carried out before the Capital can be built. If we can carry out a scheme for the drainage of a large city there should be no difficulty in providing for the drainage of a woollen factory. With regard to the other expert who was employed, I assume at considerable expense to the Government, to report upon a site for the Naval College, what became of his advice? Was this report ever published, or put before the House? I confess that I have not seen or heard of the report. We do not know even now, and I am not aware whether honorable members opposite know, which site Captain Chambers recommended as a site for the Naval College. Experts are employed by the Government, and honorable members on the other side have told us that either they are &#34; nobbled &#34; or that their expert advice is absolutely disregarded We find that, although Captain Chambers is employed as an expert to report on the various sites, the Government were not satisfied with his report, and appointed a Committee to inquire into various sites, and they selected a site at Burraneer Bay. </para>

Why did they employ experts ; why did they appoint a Committee ; why did they go to all this trouble, if they did not intend to take the slightest notice of the recommendations? I take exception to the expenditure of this large sum, if some of it is not to be spent on the permanent site for the college, and that is at Jervis Bay.- These Estimates are very vague. \Ve are not told whether any portion of this money is to be spent on the per- manent site for the college or not, but I believe that a considerable portion is to be allocated to Osborne House, at Geelong. </para>

We should try to scatter population all over Australia. To do this we might well put up with slight drawbacks, such as the increase of cost in the erection of buildings and transport.

Victorian members want to run the whole show, but it is time that we looked on these matters from a national stand-point. It is time that we did away with this parochialism, and let New South Wales have her fair share. There is a sum of  ?80,000  set down for the acquisition of sites for the erection of mobilization store buildings and drill halls, the voting of which will really commit us to an expenditure of  ?300,000.  We need to spend a great deal on drill halls, but we should be told where they are to be built. </para>

          <para>E.- No doubt; but the Department must know where it intends to erect drill halls. The Honorary Minister said that applications for drill halls were being received every day. The Department should not wait for applications. If drill halls are erected only in places whence applications for themhave been received, matters will not be properly conducted. The Department knows where drill halls are needed, and we should have some information regarding its intentions. We are not told even how much of this money is to be spent in New South Wales, how much in Victoria, and so on. I hope that the Minister will see that the vote is distributed in a national spirit, and that the money does not all go to Victoria. At the present time great inconvenience is felt from the want of drill halls. It is a good suggestion that, in determining where drill halls shall be erected, local rainfall records shall be considered, because there are places where the rainfall is not half as great as it is in other places. The sum of  &#163;50,000  is set down for Naval Colleges, Naval Barracks, Sub-marine Dep&#244;t, Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, and Naval Training School, and, in addition,  &#163;40,000  is to be contributed from the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> Fund and credited to the Trust Fund. How many Naval Colleges are there? </para>

I understand that the Geelong Harbor Trust offered the Government a site of  10  acres of land free, and also undertook to provide it with water for five years free of charge. In such circumstances, why does this item appear on the Estimates? The Honorary Minister has assured us that it was placed there before the woollen expert had recommended the Geelong site? </para>

          <para>Y.- The. mere fact of  &#163;8,000  being placed on these Estimates is an indication that the Government are not prepared to establish the factory in the Federal Territory. I do not blame the expert in this matter. Had he been told that it was the policy of this Government to locate all its factories in the Federal Territory, I am sure that he would have been able to select a suitable site for woollen mills there. In his report he does not find fault with the quality of the water that is obtainable at the Federal Capital. It is of a soft character. Indeed, it is the softest water that it is possible to get, because the stream there is fed by the snows from the mountains. The honorable member for East Sydney must imagine he is talking to a lot of children when he speaks of the want of a sewerage system there. Some time ago I had the pleasure of visiting Brisbane, and I found that there is no sewerage system there. </para>

            <para>- I remember visiting the clothing factory of Messrs. Vicars and Sons, in Sussex-street, Sydney, over twenty years ago before that city could boast of a sewerage system. When the honorable member for East Sydney endeavours to mystify the Committee with his expert knowledge upon sewerage matters, he is absolutely lopsided in his argument. He affirmed, for example, that we cannot get the necessary labour in the Federal Territory. If that be so we had better abandon the Capital, because his argument will apply with equal force to the building of the city itself, the construction of railways, and all other public works. The district from which I come produces the best wool tops in the world - I refer to Botany. Nevertheless, I desire to see the Woollen Mills established in the Federal Territory. If we are going to locate our factories in different States, the Seat of Government will not grow as we should like it to grow. We have 900 square miles of territory there, and how are we going to make it valuable except by means of population ? If we are to spend &#163;8,000 upon a woollen factory at Geelong, and &#163;15,000 upon machinery which is to be installed at Clifton Hill, we shall only be adding to the value of the private lands at those places. T quite concur in the statement of the honorable member for Nepean that, it is time a strong protest was made against the policy of establishing factories in different parts of the State. I shall vote against the Government locating the Woollen Mills at Geelong. </para>

          <para>.- The Government may very well give serious attention to several of the points which have been raised during this discussion. Honorable members are, I think, unanimous that, as far as possible, we should avoid the centralization which is going on in Australia at the present time. Population is crowding into our big cities, and we are creating enormous vested interests there. When, therefore, an opportunity presents itself of adding to the value of the lands of the Federal Territory by attracting a population there, it is our bounden duty to embrace it. We must not forget that these enhanced land values may be used very serviceably in connexion with the building of the city itself. These are very cogent reasons why we should, as far as possible, endeavour to draw into that centre all those Federal activities and utilities which it is possible to attract there. </para>

I noticed in the report which the Inspector-General of our Forces made a little time ago a complaint that it took fifteen contractors, drawing supplies from as many .different points in the Commonwealth, to clothe a single artilleryman in Western Australia. If the Government are determined to establish all these factories, they should endeavour to centralize them at one point ; and if there is one point where it is to our interest to centralize, it is in our own Federal Territory. </para>

          <para>E. - It is. in this instance. I wish to say a word as to drill halls. I have drawn the attention of the Minister to the fact that there are a number of districts in Australia where the rainfall is very heavy indeed, and where the cadets have to face the possibility of a wetting every time they go out to drill, especially in certain seasons of the year. T should like, therefore, to have an assurance that in allocating this vote of &#163;80.000 the climatic conditions of various districts will be taken into consideration. My district is one in which there is probably the heaviest rainfall in Australia. </para>

          <para>E.- Probably there are more wet days in the Minister&#39;s electorate, but I doubt whether the rainfall is So heavy there as on the north-east coast of New South Wales. Another point to which I wish to draw attention is that as to every item in this subdivision, the amount that we are asked to vote is &#34; towards cost.&#34; In only one instance are we given any idea of the expenditure to which we are finally committing ourselves. As to other votes we have not the faintest idea as to the ultimate sum that will have to be expended. I have gone through the Estimates pretty carefully, and I am inclined to think that the sum of &#163;4,000,000, which we are asked to vote, will commit us finally to not less than &#163;16,000,000. In every, case the Minister ought to give us a clear and detailed estimate as to the ultimate sum involved. There is at the present time a greater reason why this should be done than there has ever been before, because the Government are pledged to carry out the greater part of these works by day labour. We have no check whatever as to whether the works will be conducted on a reasonable basis, or whether they will be finished at a cost anywhere near the departmental Estimates. In every case where an amount is voted &#34; towards cost &#34; we should be supplied with an estimate showing the utmost expenditure contemplated. </para>

        <para class="block">I should particularly like some information in regard to the sum to be voted for the Military College. Last year we expended  &#163;&#91;68,454,  and this year we are asked for another  &#163;45,000,  making a total of  &#163;113,454.  I should like to know how many of the permanent buildings of the Military College will be completed when this money is spent? I understand that the greater part of the expenditure, so .far, has been upon temporary buildings, which will eventually be supplanted. How much will the Military College cost when completed? </para>

          <para>.- I quite agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Richmond in regard to the Military College. We ought to know definitely to how much expenditure we are to be committed. As he has observed, we have already spent  &#163;68,454,  and we are now asked to vote another  &#163;45,000.  There is no guarantee that even this will be the final expenditure on the College. I admit that it is necessary that the buildings should be erected. But at the same time our military expenditure is growing too rapidly altogether. While it is growing in one direction there are others in which there is not sufficient expenditure in the interests of those who are compelled to serve. It is not fair for honorable members to be expected to vote money for this purpose year after year without knowing whether next year and the year after another  &#163;&#91;50,000  or  &#163;100,000  will not be required. How much will it cost to complete the College? </para>

            <para>- If we are spending this money on temporary buildings we are wasting a good deal of it. We ought to know the estimated cost of carrying out the complete plans. I enter my protest against this sort of thing, and hope that the Minister will be able to explain how much the Military College is expected to cost altogether. As to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, I agree that, as far as possible, Federal works should be established in the Federal Territory. I have asked myself, however, whether it is possible at present to erect these mills upon a satisfactory basis in the Federal Capital, and I have come to the conclusion that it is not. It has been contended that if we do not establish Commonwealth works in the Territory, we shall never populate it. It is well known, however, that provision cannot be made to-day in the Territory for employes, and especially for the class of employes that would be required in a woollen mill. Boys and girls rather than adults are required, and where, I ask, should we be able to obtain them ? The Federal Capital has no railway communication. It is in its infancy. The formation of its streets has only just been commenced, and those who go there at the present time have to camp in tents. In such circumstances, what hope is there of establishing the Commonwealth Woollen Mills in the Territory. </para>

          <para>N.- The .question we&#39; have to consider is whether it would be profitable to delay these works for five, eight, or ten years, as the case might be, until we could obtain facilities to establish and carry them on profitably in the Capital. To my mind, we ought to be able now to provide the requirements of the military, and, in fact, of the whole Commonwealth service, so far as woollen goods are concerned. I therefore think that the Government are acting wisely in proposing to erect the Woollen Mills on the site recommended by the expert appointed to make a selection. The question with me is not whether they should be in this State or that, but whether they should be established, and whether the site chosen is the best for the purpose. I cannot say that it is, or is not. I have to be guided by the expert, who has no reason for recommending &#39; any particular site, other than the belief that it is the most suitable for the purpose. After all, the main point to be considered is that we should establish these works where they can be carried on as profitably as possible. If we were to erect them, either this or next year, in the Federal Territory, I venture to say that they would be a failure. The* product of the mills would cost considerably more than it would, perhaps, in any other part of Australia, and the result would be that we should have the cry that a Commonwealth venture - something savouring of Socialism which had been taken in hand by a Labour Government - had proved a distinct failure. If we were to erect the Commonwealth Woollen Mills in the Federal Territory before the provision of the necessary facilities for carrying them on, they would be doomed to failure. For that reason, and believing, as I do, that it is necessary to establish them in the interests of the Commonwealth, I am going to support the Government proposal. </para>

          <para>Y.- They will have a thirty years&#39; life. Then there are three barrack blocks for cadets, cadets&#39; renovation room, gymnasium and fittings, rifle range, magazine, observatory, two other buildings, and provision for lighting and heating. All these works will have to be carried out in conformity with what we have already done. After all,  &#163;113,000  is not so much to spend on a great Military College for 4,500,000 people. So far, I think, we have been very economical,, but there can be no doubt that we shall have to spend money on the College almost every year if it is to keep pace with the growth and prosperity of Australia. After we have laid the foundations, however, the expenditure will not be large. During the consideration of these Estimates, several members have complained that we do not spend money fast enough - that during last year too many votes lapsed. To-night, however, the honorable member for Richmond seems to fear that we are committing the country to some enormous expenditure. </para>

          <para>Y. - I am glad of the honorable member&#39;s interjection. Time after time, during the last two years, complaint has been made of the failure to build drill halls, particularly in districts where the rainfall is heavy. On the north-west coast of Tasmania, the rainfall is not very heavy, but on the west coast, I believe that the annual fall ranges from 7 feet to  10  feet. It is often impossible for young men to drill there at night time. </para>

          <para>Y.- I am trying to explain why we did not do so. Sometimes a vote cannot be expended for the reason that an agreement cannot be arrived at in regard to the price asked for a particular site. In several places where I thought we should have no trouble in securing a site for a drill hall, the price asked was so high that it was impossible to go on unless we engaged in litigation, and made a lot of trouble. We do not wish to take citizens into the Law Courts in regard to every little question that may be raised, and, that being so, we have often to refrain from purchasing a site, with the result that work for which provision has been made has to be postponed. I desire to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that we have now decided to have in readiness a large sum on which we can draw without keeping people waiting when a drill hall needs to be erected. I agree with the honorable member for Richmond that we ought to spend this money in those parts of Australia where the rainfall is heavy, because in such districts it is often impossible for young men to drill at night time. On the west coast of Tasmania, I have seen young fellows take shelter under verandahs until a shower has passed, and then resume their drill. If we are going to make the compulsory training system a success, we must not be afraid of spending a few pounds. A few pounds for the defence of this great country is nothing. This item of.  &#163;80,000  is part of a total of  .&#163;300,000,  which will, we think, complete the drill halls throughout Australia. </para>

          <para>Y.- It is as good a calculation as can be made in regard to the drill halls that will be required. We shall have  &#163;80,000  to start with, and as we have our own Works Departments in New South Wales and Victoria, those States, more especially as they have the largest population, will probably secure the greater part of this vote. We shall be able now to go right on, wherever a hall is required, to build it by day labour, but honorable members should remember that we cannot do everything in a day. We received  ,&#163;40,000  from the people of New South Wales towards the establishment of a Naval College at Jervis Bay. </para>

          <para>Y.- Now with respect to the Woollen Mills. I may say that we went into that matter very carefully. No one was more anxious than I, if it were possible, that the mills should be established at Yass-Canberra. I wish to see them a great success. But we had to take into account the cost of transportation to and from the Federal Capital if the mills were established there. We had to consider exchanges also, and, dealing with the matter as a cold business proposition, we found that that could not be done at present, though it may be possible later. If we were indifferent as to whether it paid or not, we might, of course, adopt the suggestion that has been made. If it were a failure, as the result of our mistake, it would only be like many other propositions that did not have the advantage of a good start. I hope that honorable members opposite will now see the necessity of Letting, these Estimates go through as quickly as possible. </para>

          <para>.- This kind of debate in Committee has its advantages and disadvantages. It is an advantage to some honorable members to be allowed to skirmish over a great many subjects, but the disadvantage is that the views expressed are of a superficial character, and we do not seem to get at the root of any matter. I recognise that the Minister of Home Affairs is willing and anxious to give the House information. I think he has proved that by the publication of his periodical hand-book, in which he undertakes to give in a readable and portable form information as to the progress he is making in the different branches of his Department. But the Committee would like to know a great deal in connexion with some very important items in these Estimates which the Minister has not yet told us. One of the most important is the progress of the Federal Capital. We have heard a good deal about what ought to be established there, the plans of railways, and so on, but we have been given no idea of even the approximate time within which we may hope to see this Parliament settled there. Some six years ago the Government Architect of New South Wales .informed me that he was not only prepared to place before Parliament plans of all the Parliament Houses in the &#39;world, but to undertake to erect what he called the kernel of a Parliament House to accommodate the Senate and the House of Representatives, buildings for the public servants, and a residence for the Governor-General with- in two and a-half years, at a total expenditure of  &#163;250,000.  I brought that before the House some years ago. </para>

            <para>- There is a reference to the proposed Woollen Mills, anc it has been contended that they should be established in the Federal Capital. .One of the arguments which has been used against that contention is that there has been so little progress made with the establishment of the Capital that there would be no habitations and no sanitary provision for those who would require to be employed in connexion with the mills. It is altogether impossible to start an enterprise of this kind in the Federal Territory under existing conditions. I want to know why the existing conditions are such as to prevent that? If the Government had made some attempt to carry out the designs upon which so much money has been spent, honorable members would not have been able to use as an argument against the establishment of the Woollen Mills in the Federal Territory that it is at present a wilderness, and that there is no provision made for the people who would be employed in connexion with them. It is on this account their establishment in Victoria, in temporary premises, at the cost of about  &#163;9,000  is justified. Two years ago I asked the present Government to take into consideration the suggestions of the Government Architect of New South Wales, and begin what that gentleman had called the kernel of the Parliament House. Directly that is commenced and occupied, habitations will spring up, notwithstanding that the land is leasehold ; and we shall immediately have the nucleus of a city which will enable us to place an  enterprise of this sort within it. I feel that, instead of investing money in a place from which we shall eventually have to remove it, the factory ought to be located in the Federal Territory. Is the Minister doing anything towards the erection of the Federal buildings ? </para>

          <para>H.- I totally disagree with the argument of the honorable member for East Sydney to the effect that it would be impossible to have these factories in Federal Territory owing to the absence of sanitary provisions. We were told that Geelong affords the sanitary facilities that the Capital area does not ; but we have just learned from its own member that Geelong itself possesses no sanitary arrangements except those old-fashioned, antediluvian arrangements to be found in any advanced country town. Notwithstanding the advanced character of the honorable member who represents Geelong, and who is never tired of advertising the place, we find that it is an unsewered area. </para>

            <para>- I now desire to say a word or two in regard to the question of the removal of the Victoria Barracks, Paddington, to a piece of land which is known by the name of &#34; Redleaf.&#34; Those barracks cover an area of, I should say, 5 to 8 acres, which represents an enormous property in the centre of one of the most populous neighbourhoods of Sydney - a neighbourhood as populous as Collingwood, in Melbourne. This area at present is devoted entirely to barracks purposes. If the Commonwealth Government are prepared to make some arrangement, I know that the municipal council of Paddington would be very glad to get rid of the barracks, for the simple reason that they would like to see the ground covered with houses, from which rates could be obtained. I do not agree with the honorable member for East Sydney as to the roads. The long road which runs on one side is the main road, and carries a tramway, and it is a road which will exist when the barracks are forgotten. The other two roads at the end are filled with terrace houses, and entail no more expense to keep in order than do the roads of an ordinary suburb. The lower road has not much traffic, because on one side is a reserve, and on the other side the barracks. However, the primary cause of the desire of the municipality to get rid of the barracks is that they may be able to  obtain  rates from the area. The proposed substituted land known as &#34; Redleaf &#34; is a private &#39;house on the margin of a beach, with &#39;Other private houses to the right and the left. </para>

          <para>H.- No : it is one of the most beautiful suburbs in Sydney. I do not suppose &#39;the honorable member has ever been allowed to go there ; but, if he were. I have no doubt that, in his more ambitious moments, he would like to have a residence there. However, to talk of Redleaf as a substitute for the barracks area at Paddington is to compare a pockethandkerchief with a. sheet - it is an absur dity. Unless it is proposed to resume  the houses  to the left and the right, in order to utilize a point stretching out into the harbor, I can only say that the scheme will be useless. 8 </para>

My own opinion is that the Paddington area is worth nearly &#163;&#91;250,000. It was obtained by the Government of New South Wales in exchange for Garden.

          <para>H.- That is my recollection, and the Minister will be able to learn for himself  whether that is not the case. I think that these Estimates contain an item which will allow me to refer to the question! of Sydney Government House. It has been referred to during this discussion. The Prime Minister has been to Sydney in order to see whether he could make an arrangement by which the building could be occupied by the Governor-General. </para>

            <para>- Then 1 want to touch upon another question which I think has been discussed very fully, and that is the site for the temporary Naval College at Geelong. I wish the Minister to tell us how it is that we have been informed again and again that the Harbor Trust of Geelong undertook to give up a site for nothing if the Naval College were placed temporarily in Geelong, and that at the same time there is an item of  &#163;8,000  on these Estimates in such a form as to suggest that some purchase is necessary. I want to know whether the Harbor Trust ever made such a promise, and, if so, whether they are carrying it out, and, further, why we are asked to spend  &#163;8,000  on something which they undertook to give us for nothing. If the Minister will inform us on that point, with which several honorable members have dealt, I think that the Committee will be much more satisfied. </para>

          <para>. - The more I think over these Estimates the more it seems to me to be an amazing fact that the Ministry have asked us to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds without even submitting a sketch plan of the expenditure. In no other Parliament in Australia do honorable members consent to vote money away in chis reckless fashion and without having first submitted to them some plan of the proposed expenditure. Here, for instance, is an item of  &#163;80,000  towards an estimated expenditure of  &#163;300,000  for the acquisition of sites for the erection of mobilization store buildings, and drill halls. Where are these store buildings and drill halls to be erected? Surely there is some plan or purpose in the mind of the Minister&#34; when he asks for the expenditure of this huge sum ! Let it be remembered that in voting this item of  &#163;80,000  we shall commit ourselves to the expenditure of  &#163;300,000.  I am not complaining of the amount of the expenditure, but of its purposelessness and its planlessness. In New South Wales, and I believe in Victoria, any public work involving an expenditure of  &#163;20,000  is first of all inquired into by a Public Works Committee, and the details of the -expenditure, together with plans and -almost specifications, have to be laid on the table of the House. But in this case we have the bald statement that a sum of  &#163;80,000  is wanted towards building mobilization store buildings and drill halls. Where are they to be placed, when are they to be built, and of what material ? Have we nothing to do with these matters ? Every other Parliament insists upon being furnished with information of this description. We have nothing of the kind here, but are asked to vote the money, and put our blind trust in the Government. It is a case of &#34; Open your mouth and shut your eyes, and see what King O&#39;Malley will send you.&#34; &#34; Pay up and look pleasant, and do not ask any questions &#34; seems to be the idea dominating these Estimates. It is about time that honorable members awoke to a sense of their responsibility as trustees for the expenditure of the public money. I submit that we will not discharge our duty unless we get from the Government a broad plan of this expenditure indicating to us where, how, when, and under what conditions it is going to be incurred. Questions have been asked tonight about the erection of a woollen mill and a temporary Naval College at Geelong. The Minister does not know anything about these matters I am sorry to say. </para>

          <para>K.- The Government expect to spend ten times that amount. I shall now give the Committee some information which I happened to get the other week for quite another purpose from the Minister of Defence, who is responsible for the erection and control of the woollen mill at Geelong. He estimated the cost of the building at  &#163;&#91;70,000,  and the cost of the machinery at  &#163;40,000,  making a total of  &#163;&#91;110,000.  The Minister of Home Affairs has been trying to bluff the Committee to-night, for it was nothing but bluff when he told us that the woollen mill is going to cost  &#163;8,000. </para>

          <para>K.- Is it not beyond a joke when we are asked to fool away money like this without being told anything about the details? We are asked to vote  &#163;&#91;8,000  towards the cost of woollen mills. When are they to be erected ? The sum of  &#163;&#91;8,000  will not pay for them. If you are going to clothe your army - and that is a very urgent matter - is it not time that a serious proposal was put before Parliament? The sum of  &#163;8,000  is asked for towards an estimated expenditure of  &#163;110,000.  Were I a Ministerial supporter, believing in the Socialistic enterprises which honorable members opposite believe in, I should not allow this bunch of carrots to be&#39; dangled before my nose. Then, whereas the Minister of Home Affairs has assured us that the temporary Naval College at Geelong will cost about  &#163;8,000,  the estimated cost of establishing and equipping the College is given under the hand of the Prime Minister at  &#163;13,000.  My point, however, is that Parliament is being asked to vote money without being given details of the proposed expenditure, and no other Parliament in Australia would think of consenting to. these huge commitments without the fullest explanation. We are asked to commit ourselves to an expenditure of  &#163;300,000  on mobilization store buildings and drill halls alone. Should we not be told where the drill halls are to be placed, in what States, and districts, and with what objects? </para>

          <para>S. - The condition of boys drilling in muddy streets while it was raining, and going home to their mammas in wet clothes, was pictured in most pathetic language by members of the Opposition. While on the one hand they declaimed against the Government for its reckless extravagance, unparalleled expenditure, and other superlative misdemeanors, they, on the other hand, rated us for not having undertaken a larger expenditure than is proposed. Wherever it has been decided to erect a drill hall, the site is named, and the estimated cost stated in separate items, as will be seen by a perusal of the Estimates. Having entered on the policy of constructing drill halls; that policy cannot be stayed in any one electorate. We cannot say that the little boys of Parramatta, the future electors of that constituency, shall have drill halls, but that money shall not be spent on drill halls elsewhere. But having embarked upon this policy, it follows as a matter of course that where drill halls are required, they will have to be erected. As the whole system is entirely new, and as we are quite unable to say where drill halls are needed, or how many of them are required, it is impossible for the Government to set down either the places at which they will be erected, or what will be their cost. But, in keeping with the general policy of this Parliament, and with the desire of the Government that our boys shall be provided with sufficient shelter&#39; to be drilled under, we have set down  &#163;80,000  upon these Estimates- </para>

          <para>S- And for mobilization store buildings. When we were discussing a previous item, and before this particular item had caught the eagle eye of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, he loudly exclaimed, &#34; You are not spending half enough on drill halls. Look at these trivial amounts. They are absurd. Spend more, and more, and more.&#34; But the moment he finds an amount of  &#163;80,000  set down in connexion with drill halls - that is the sum estimated by our military experts as likely to be required during the current financial year - he reverses his atti tude, and cries, &#34; This is a huge amount to spend in the absence of details.&#34; I tell him frankly that I cannot inform him how many weatherboards will go into a drill hall, how many square feet its area will embrace, how many doors or windows it will contain, how many men will be put to work upon it, and whether it will take them a week or a month to erect it. In these Estimates, we have followed the form in. which Estimates have been submitted to the Committee for a number of years. I hold in my hand a copy of the Estimates for  1909-10,  for which the honorable member for Parramatta was responsible, and thereI find the various &#39;items set out in precisely the same way as they are set out here. In some instances, Parliament was asked to authorize votes for buildings at particular places. In others the expenditure of a lump sum was sanctioned without any details being given. </para>

            <para>- I repeat that in the Estimates for  1909-10  there is a vote which reads, &#39; &#39; Lithgow Small Arms Factory, towards cost of site and construction,  &#163;6,016.&#34;  In the present instance, we have an item which reads, &#34; Towards the cost of site and construction of woollen mills,  &#163;8,000.&#34;  The position is precisely similar. There is scarcely a line, letter or comma of difference. When the honorable member was responsible for Estimates, they were perfect, but when similar Estimate.1 are submitted by another Ministry, there is not a line, letter, or comma in them which is perfect. It seems to me that we ought, to be fair to each other no matter upon which side of the chamber we may sit. Even if we are opposed to each other, there ought to be some moral sense in debate </para>

I say that theEstimates which we are now considering in their general construction, and in the information which they give to the Committee, are identical with the Estimates which have been submitted in previous years. Each year, as the result of experience, Ministers supply a little more information in connexion with the Estimates of their Departments than has previously been supplied. </para>

          <para>S. - Yes, the estimated expenditure was set down at &#163;25,000. So that three years ago we were asked by the honorable member to vote &#163;6,000 towards a total of &#163;25,000 for a small arms factory. But as evidencing how utterly unreliable was that estimate, I find that before it was completed the factory cost &#163;68.690, or nearly three times what we were informed would be its total cost when we were asked to agree to the vote of &#163;6,000. </para>

          <para>S.- The Minister of Defence is anxious that honorable members should have the fullest possible information. If there be some details that I am not now in a position to give, and that honorable members require, they have but to submit their requests, and the particulars will be supplied to them to-morrow, either publicly or privately. Let them put their inquiries in the form of a question, and the information will be given openly. As far as the woollen mill is concerned, it is impossible to say precisely how many bricks, stones, boards, and other material are going into it. We are asking, during the financial year, for &#163;8,000, in keeping with general methods. At the present time the plans are only being prepared, and it is estimated that that sum of money will be spent during this year. The whole of the details are not yet forthcoming. Under the circumstances, I submit that it is scarcely fair to make charges of a general character, alleging an absence of information of which honorable members ought to be in possession. </para>

            <para>- Two such strong fighters may very well be left to battle it out for themselves. But with regard to the assertion of the Minister that it is impossible for the Department to give anything like an approximately correct estimate of what the cost of any particular structure will be, I have to say that it has always seemed to me that one of the defects of our system of carrying out public works is that no proper estimates are made as the first step in the process of erecting public buildings. lt is well known that in connexion with private contracts, when plans have been completed and specifications prepared, contractors can estimate the cost to a nicety. They can say how many bricks, how much mortar, how much timber, and what quantities of other materials will ba required. They can calculate the cost to a few pounds, even in a very large sum. I contend that the business of the Commonwealth will never be conducted on a satisfactory basis until something of that sort is done in connexion with every undertaking that is proposed to be carried out. </para>

          <para>R. - No doubt there are, but even as to extras a margin can easily be specified. I may say, also, for the benefit of the honorable member for Corangamite, that extras are very often attempts made by contractors to squeeze a few more pounds out of a job than they are entitled to get, and a competent architect or valuator is able effectively to checkmate a great many of them. At any rate, nothing seems to be estimated with respect to the carrying out of Federal contracts, and, consequently, work is not conducted on a satisfactory basis. If this debate has the effect of causing our officers to pay more regard to this phase of their duties than they have done in the past, the time will not have been wasted. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to enter my protest against this method of bringing forward estimates. The Minister has not satisfied me with his explanation in connexion with the Military College. The sum of &#163;68,454 _ has been expended, of which between &#163;12,000 and &#163;13,000 was spent on permanent buildings, leaving something like &#163;56.,000 to be spent on temporary buildings. I go a long way with the honorable member for Parramatta in thinking that there should be some estimate of the cost of a building, showing also its size, the specific purposes for which it is required, and its character. These particulars should be laid before honorable members when they are asked to vote money. At present we do&#39; not know where we are. I object to voting money without knowing what the total expenditure on a particular work is going to be. The Government architects ought to draw up complete plans, and we should know the anticipated cost of every building. I do not say that they can esti mate the cost to a pound, or even to a few hundreds, in the case of big buildings ; but we should have some guide. At the present time we drift along from year to year, and do not know what we are doing. This year it appears &#163;45,000 is to be added to the &#163;12,000 already expended on permanent buildings for the Military College. That makes &#163;57,000, in addition to the &#163;56,000 spent on temporary buildings. I think it is a fair thing that we should be informed whether the &#163;56,000 ir likely to be sufficient for present requirements. I should say that that sum ought to&#39; be enough to provide all the accommodation necessary in the initial stages of training officers. </para>

            <para>- We have spent quite enough on temporary buildings, yet we are asked to spend &#163;45,000 more. Perhaps next year we shall be asked to spend another &#163;80,000, or even. &#163;100,000. It is only right that we should have an objective in view. We should know what we are making for. We ought to know the departmental estimate for a given time, and money should be asked for that purpose., and that only. At present we have no guide as to finality in expenditure. I enter my protest against this method of voting money. It is not a proper way of carrying on the business of the country. When any extension of the buildings is required Ministers should submit to the Committee the necessary plans and we should then bc able to consider whether we ought to vote any money in excess of the expenditure for which provision had already been made. To go on in this slipshod manner is very unsatisfactory. T hope that next year a better system will be introduced, so that we shall know the amount of money that we have to vote for any particular purpose. If that is done we shall be able to keep a curb on the expenditure. </para>

          <para>.- I think that the Honorary Minister was hardly fair to the honorable member for Parramatta. He tried to score considerably by referring the Committee to page 276 of the Estimates for 1909-10, where there appeared only a small item of &#163;6,000 odd in connexion with the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, whilst the footnote showed1&#39; that the total estimated expenditure was &#163;25,000. He then flourished before the Committee figures to show that the total expenditure came to over &#163;60,000. Had  the honorable member been fair, he would have pointed out also that at page 294 of the very Estimates from which he was quoting, there was an item of &#163;49,000 also in regard to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. As a matter of fact the honorable member&#39;s statement was absolutely inaccurate. </para>

          <para>M. - The honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable member for Richmond put a question which has been repeated by the honorable member for Hunter. Their action is not taken in any spirit of antagonism. Their desire is to help both sides. That is generally the spirit in which the honorable member for Parramatta speaks, and the object of the criticism is generally to assist honorable members opposite. As to this, particular item, the point made by him is perfectly clear. . He says that we have here an item of &#163;80,000, which purports to be a commitment for &#163;300,000, and that neither the Minister of Home Affairs nor the Minister representing the Minister of Defence can mention one district in which it is intended to expend any of that money. If the Minister is to have a blank cheque for &#163;80,000, I shall be very much surprised if he is not inundated with requests for drill halls. </para>

          <para>M.- I will look after the interests of Australia. I know that whatever benefits Toowoomba must benefit Australia. Apart from that matter, however, I think that this objection ought to be seriously entertained. We are asked to authorize an expenditure of &#163;80,000 in respect of this item, yet the Minister has not given us the slightest hint as to what proportion of that sum will be required in respect of sites, how much will be required for mobilization stores, and how much for drill halls. The Minister ought to take it for granted that this Committee is prepared to vote all that is necessary to make the compulsory defence system absolutely efficient, but at the same time we want to know that we are working according to some definite plan and system. If we are to have these mobilization stores, surely they are to be built according to a definite system. Surely their location is not to be fixed in some haphazard way. Our contention is that before these proposed vor&#60;-s are agreed to, the Minister should give  the  Committee some information as to the lines on which this expenditure will be made. That was the point made by the honorable member for Parramatta, but instead of being given the information for which he asked, he was subjected to extraordinary criticism. The Minister said with perfectfrankness that he did not know what it would cost to put a piece of mortar here or a bit of timber there; but surely those who are advising him have before them a definite scheme. They must know the lines on which they intend to work. If they do not, there will be chaos in the Defence Department. I hope that the Minis-  ter will show us that the money is to be expended according to a definite system. The Committee, I am sure, is willing to vote all that is necessary for the Military College, but we ought to have from the Minister an assurance that these so-called temporary expenditures are to be limited in some way. As regards the College it is about time that we had some idea of the permanency of its design, so that we may know that the money now being expended in connexion with it will be devoted to the establishment of permanent buildings in accordance with a definite plan, even if the work is being carried out&#39; piecemeal. It will be a costly matter for the Federal City itself if the Government spend a lot of money upon temporary wooden buildings, which they will have to pull down later on. I believe that the Minister will keep his eye upon all expenditure on the Federal City so that what we are building now may become part of the permanent buildings of that city. Our desire is that the city, when completed, shall be something of which Australia can be proud ; but we certainly do not wish to see a large sum wasted there. As to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills I am not going to raise any question in reference to the site, but I should like to obtain some information. Will the hands who are employed in these mills be on the temporary or permanent staff of the Commonwealth &#34;Public Service? </para>

There never has been a Minister in this House who could give so little information upon any matter connected with the Department with which he was associated. Of course, the honorable member for Adelaide makes up for this in theatrical gasconading.  His  rhetoric was very fine indeed, and his acting perfect ; but I complain of his singular lack of knowledge concerning public matters about which we should be informed. I am still wanting information. I am representing the great taxpayers of Australia. The Government are at present proposing to spend the taxpayers&#39; money. </para>

          <para>K.- My honorable friends have adopted a refinement of the &#34; gag.&#34; They move the adjournment of the debate. They have not the pluck to impose the &#34;gag&#39; straightforwardly as we did. We have had the Estimates for 1909-10 flourished this evening. I have been told a score of times in this House, by the Attorney-General amongst others, that we never did anything on those Estimates. But the Honorary Minister was busily engaged for ten minutes in pointing out that we really did something after all in connexion with the new scheme of defence. I will take an opportunity later of referring to those Estimates more in detail, because they will answer a great many of the reckless statements recently made by members  01  the present Government. In the meantime, by this vote for mobilization store buildings and drill halls, we are asked to commit the country to an expenditure of  &#163;300,000.  No details are forthcoming - the Minister has none. </para>

          <para>K.- I see there is art item in connexion with a hospital, other items for a shed for bicycles and a cricket pavilion, and an item the details of which are not decided. The last is very illuminating. It is not my intention, however, to criticise these items ; my point is that, when we are asked to vote these large sums, we ought to have some plan of the complete building ; and that remark applies to every item here. We are committing ourselves to an expenditure of nearly  &#163;500,000  without any plan or specification showing the total expenditure. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to know when the wireless station at Pennant Hills is to be taken over by the Government and completed. Last year &#163;5,800 was appropriated, and only &#163;2,881 was expended. There seems to be almost a fatality about these wireless stations. For a year or two everything was almost in a matter of scare as to the urgency of these buildings, but somehow or other matters have fallen into a state of strange quietude during recent months. I think it is time that the Minister was able to tell the House that some of these buildings have been completed, and that soon we shall have them in working order. How long the erection of the station at Pennant Hills has taken I do not quite know. I know that a year ago it was being built. Why, at the end of a year, has it not been taken over? </para>

          <para>K.- This is supposed to be part of our Defence scheme, and a very useful and integral part of it, too. I do not think that a mere squabble with the contractor ought to prevent this wireless station from coming into use at the earliest possible moment. It seems to me that all he has to do is to keep on picking a quarrel with the Department, and it may be years before we take over the station. I should like to know what is the cause of this continued delay in connexion with the completion of wireless stations, and why we cannot get them properly under way.&#39; Is it because of some faulty specification in the first instance? Is it because the contractor is unable to complete his contract satisfactorily, and make the engines run as they should do? What are the prospects of this trouble being remedied and the service being brought into use? </para>

          <para>K. - I dare say that the ex-Postmaster-General can tell us what the trouble is in connexion with the contract. Is the machinery wrong, or what is the trouble? Surely the wireless station is not to be held up until some houses are completed, and the country is drained ! Those are works which could proceed at any time while the public were getting the benefit of the wireless machinery. I do not want to know when the erection of the houses or the drainage will be completed, but when the machine itself will be working, and when wireless messages can be sent by the public in the performance of their daily business. I think it is time that the Committee got from the Minister a statement of what really is the trouble with the contractor. </para>

          <para>. - Last year for post-office buildings in Western Australia  &#163;38,136  was voted, and only  &#163;18,254  expended, leaving a balance of  &#163;19,882  unexpended. I have spoken about this matter before during the consideration of these Estimates, and now that we are dealing with the Works Estimates for the Department I must refer to it again. I cannot understand why a number of post-offices which people are very anxious to have, and for which money was available, were not constructed during the past year. For the Swan electorate, which sends me here, there are no less than nine post-offices on this small list. </para>

            <para>- I may mention that the Swan electorate is bigger than the whole of Victoria. The rule applies in Western Australia as in Victoria, that before a post-office is granted the existence of a certain amount of revenue must be shown. The sum of  &#163;&#91;8,787  was voted for the erection of nine post-offices in my electorate, but not one of them has yet been begun. Were I not very generous minded, I should ask if this comes about because I am a member of the Opposition. </para>

        <para>Great dissatisfaction is felt in Western Australia at the delay in opening for public use the wireless station at Fremantle. When I saw it some time ago it seemed to me an excellent piece of work, well constructed, and in every way suitable for its purpose,, and I understood from those in charge that it was almost ready for use. That was four or five months ago, and only the other day I heard that it is possible to easily and satisfactorily communicate from the station with Sydney. In the meantime the people of Fremantle are unable to use it to communicate with the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental, Orient, NorddeutscherLloyd, and other steam-ship companies trading with the port. The Pennant Hills station, near Sydney, is still unutilized ; and we are not told from what cause. If there are any legal difficulties making it inadvisable for Ministers to give us information, I do not wish to complicate the position, but if Ministers have information that they can give us, I should like to know for the satisfaction of the people of Western Australia when the station will be open. &#34; Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,&#34; and we should like some assurance that the station will be open for business within a short period&#39;. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that it is necessary to refer to certain matters relating to the postal, telegraph, and telephone services, in the absence of the Postmaster-General ; but, no doubt, the Minister of External Affairs, who preceded him in office, will have some information to give us, and there may not be another opportunity for saying what I wish to say. It is not with any satisfaction that I criticise unfavorably the administration of this Department, because I recognise the magnitude of its work, the complexity of many of its problems, and the difficulty of keeping abreast with its vast business. It is the duty of honorable members to take an interest in this great, valuable, and important service, and to bring under the attention of the Postmaster-General matters of which he ought to be cognisant. By so doing, the public may be granted the increased postal facilities to which they are entitled, especially in view of the fact that we have now reached a period when no plea of insufficient funds can be put forward. The time was when Postmasters-General, upon being confronted with numerous demands, were obliged to give the stereotyped reply that, owing to lack of funds, those demands could not be granted. Today, however, there is an abundance of funds available in this connexion. Yet the Department scarcely keeps abreast of the improvements effected in other parts of the world. In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall endeavour to summarize my complaints as much as possible. In the first place, I wish to draw attention to certain suggestions which I made to the PostmasterGeneral on the 27th October last, shortly after my return from England. They were to the effect that the Department should institute inquiries into a number of improved and progressive telegraphic and telephonic instruments which are in use in London. As will be seen by reference to page 1950 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I asked the PostmasterGeneral whether he would cause inquiries to be made and official reports obtained respecting the practicability and advisability of introducing, in connexion with the Commonwealth Telegraph Department, a number of telegraph instruments, said to embody the latest improvements in telegraphy. Among these were the Creed receiver and attachment, used to translate electrical signals sent by Wheatstone methods into printed messages ready for delivery. This Creed receiver is really a wonderful instrument, and it is strange that in a Department like our Post Office no attempt has been made to introduce such a time and labour-saving appliance, which would greatly add to the efficiency of the Wheatstone instrument. It is an appliance which actually prints the messages from the tape as it emerges from the Wheatstone instrument. I also asked the PostmasterGeneral whether he would inquire into the Hughes telegraph instrument. This appliance is fitted with keys corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, and these are worked like the keys of a piano. The instrument is capable of printing messages as they are received from the tape, and forms one of the marvels of the Central Telegraph Office in London. But an even more wonderful instrument is that to which the third paragraph of my question relates, namely, the Baudot instrument. This is fitted with five keys, and is capable of sending four messages each way at the same time along one and the same wire, and of printing each message asit is received. All these appliances have been demonstrated by experience in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and India, to be of great value, and ought, therefore, to be utilized in all great Departments, such as the Postal Department in Australia. Fancy an instrument which is so wonderfully constructed that eight messages can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, and these messages actually come out of the instrument printed ready for delivery. When I saw these marvellous demonstrations, it struck me that, despite all our boasted progress, we in Australia were not sufficiently up to date. I could not but wonder what our officers had been doing that they had not directed attention to these scientific devices, by which not merely time and labour, but money might actually be saved. I was informed that when the Baudot instrument was introduced into India, it resulted in the saving of thousands of pounds, which would otherwise have been absorbed in the construction of telegraph lines, because of the possibility of utilizing one wire to send four messages each way simultaneously.- I invited the attention of the Postmaster-General to these matters on  27th  October last year, and I was informed that - </para>

They cannot plead poverty or want of funds ; and, particularly in connexion with the building of new lines, such as the proposed transcontinental railway and other means of communication to our distant outposts, the Postmaster-General should insist on these new instruments and devices, which have been demonstrated to be successful in England, India, and on the Continent of Europe, having a fair trial.

            <para>- I hope that the Postmaster-General will place himself in communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hesketh,</inline> and insist on something being done. The head man in the Central Office in London told me that there would be no difficulty in introducing these machines into Australia ; that if our Department required advice or assistance, or the loan of some of their experts to teach our officers to use these delicate and, it may be, complicated instruments, men would be lent on the same terms as they were lent to India, without any premium. I hope that the Postmaster- General will devote his best judgment to this matter. I shall be happy to place at his disposal the report which I have received from the Central Telegraph Office in London. I have no desire to worry or nag at him, but I do think that the time has now arrived when I might reasonably expect an answer to a question that I put last year. I think that if the Postmaster- </para>

        </continue>
        <para class="block">General gives special attention to this subject, he will be forced to give these improved machines a fair trial, and not allow Australia to lag behind any longer. The result will be a saving in money, and also in working expenses, which will fully justify any extra expenditure incurred in procuring these instruments, and bringing them into action. I wish now to draw attention to a matter which requires explanation. Although Parliament last year placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General a very liberal grant for erecting telephone and telegraph lines in various parts of Australia, the Department has not seemed to be able to avail itself of the money that it applied for. Upon referring to page  239  of these Estimates, honorable members will find that  &#163;700,000  was actually appropriated last year for new telephones and telegraphs. Below that sum is mentioned an amount of  &#163;600,000,  which was ordered to be placed to the Trust Fund for telephones and telegraphs, constituting special works. It was pointed, out that that procedure might result in difficulties, and consequently the  &#163;600,000  was included in a special Appropriation Act. The Act is to be found on page  95  of the Volume of Statutes for  191 1.  It contains a schedule, appropriating an amount to special works. So that this sum was set .aside under a special Act of Parliament in addition to the  &#163;700,000  contained in the Appropriation Act.

          <para>.- I can mention several works that have been delayed, not from want of material, but through extraordinary and unexplained delay. I know of two lines that were authorized two years ago, and are not finished yet. One was a telephone line between Kangaroo Flat and Laanecoorie. The Minister will be interested to know the particulars, and will Form his own opinion as to whether there is not reasonable ground for criticism. This case is typical of the delay that occurs. Thje work was authorized in 1910. The money was voted. There was a delay of three inonths in the preparation of the bond and of the maintenance agreement, and on inquiries <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> another  line. That brings us to September, 1910. From that time onward, there was adelay  of ten  or eleven months in the execution of the bond and maintenance agreement. </para>

          <para>.- Perhaps so. This brings us up to September, 191 1. Since then I have received official information from the Minister in this House that ten months have been occupied in laying out work, preparing details, calling tenders for poles - iron-bark poles having been tendered and rejected - and calling for fresh tenders for cheaper timber not to exceed the estimate. This brings us up to 25th July last. Ten months have been absorbed by these extraordinary delays. </para>

          <para>.- I do not think it has been started. The line in question is to extend from Kangaroo Flat to Laanecoorie, a distance of 20 miles, and the estimated cost is &#163;300. In regard to this small work there has been a delay of two years. As another example of delay, let me point out what has happened in regard to a proposed telephone line from Raywood to Kamarooka, a. distance of 12 miles. The estimated cost of this line, which was authorized two years ago, would not be more than &#163;250. I asked the Minister recently to give the reasons for the delay. I had no desire to refleet on any one, and I made my request as polite as possible. The official statement as to the causes of the delay is set out in several paragraphs. First of all, we have the statement that the delay was due to failure on the part of the residents concerned to execute the maintenance agreement until a period of nine months had elapsed from the time they were notified of the terms upon which the line would be constructed </para>

          <para>.- But since July, 1909, when I took office as PostmasterGeneral, there has been plenty of money available for the Department. There was plenty in my time, and there has been plenty ever since. We have been granting between  &#163;800,000  and  &#163;900,000  a year for telephones and telegraphs, and one would think that the Department ought by this time to have accumulated a fair stock of wire. </para>

          <para>. - No ; evidently the sum of  &#163;600,000  has not been expended. Surely some of it should have been spent in securing a supply of wire. That would not have involved the employment of a large staff. Honorable members generally complain of the delay in carrying out these works, and one of the causes assigned is the want of material. This expenditure of  &#163;600,000  was authorized last year, and one would think that the Department could have obtained a supply of material from the Old Country within six months. I ask the Minister to inquire what orders for material have been sent to Londonsince the Department have had money available for the purpose, and why this shortage of material has occurred. It seems to be to a large extent inexcusable. Even the occurrence of the shipping strike extending over three months is not a sufficient ground for the extraordinary delay that has taken place. A further cause of delay in constructing this line was stated as follows: - </para>

          <para>.- I was; but I think it of sufficient importance to bring it again under the attention of the Minister. These delays, which may be occurring in other directions, show the necessity for Ministerial scrutiny and vigilance. If these matters are not closely followed up by the Minister, the Department may get behind with its work, and there is sure to be a slackness which will lead to criticism. I offer this criticism with a view of placing before the Minister information that will give him a more commanding position in his Department. Unless he is informed of the facts, he cannot rectify a grievance. Something ought to be done to speed up the Department, and to induce it to obtain a ready stock of material for carrying out small works of the kind to which I have referred. If I were in office, I should insist upon an ample supply of such material being available. If the trouble were due to a lack of delicate telegraphic instruments, one could understand that there might be delay in securing them; but there cannot be any scarcity of wire&#187;in the great markets of the world such as would justify the plea of the Department. I hope that as the result of these suggestions the Minister will be able before long to announce that the Telegraph Branch has been equipped with some of the up-to-date instruments that I have specified, and that the departmental resources have been brought up to the demands of the public. I could enumerate complaints of the character to which I have referred, which have come from various districts, but I do not desire to do so. Complaint as to delay in carrying out small works is general. Only to-day I received from a constituency which I do not represent, and shall not mention, a letter complaining of delay in carrying out ordinary telephonic extensions. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to indorse what the honorable member for Bendigo has said with regard to what appears to me to be  the  altogether unnecessary delay in making telephone extensions. Just before the close of last session the Postmaster-General was asked how many country telephone lines were approved,  how  many lines the Department expected to construct during the year, and how many were under consideration. Speaking from memory, I think that the answer was that ninety-six lines were approved, that fortyeight were expected to be constructed during the financial year, and that  132  were under consideration. The work of telephone construction has been going from bad to worse in the last twelve months. There is a gross lack of ordinary business management evident. If the Department were run on business lines, it would not be in the position in which it was placed in New South Wales, when it had not a coil of wire to carry on necessary telephone extensions. </para>

        <para class="block">I Can mention the case of a rather long line, from Tabulam to Tenterfield, a distance of 49 miles, the construction of which has been approved, for a long time. The first excuse given for delay in construction was that the Department could not get the necessary labour. After consultation with the mayor of Tenterfield, and some residents along the line, I had all the necessary labour promised, and expert labour at that. When I sent this information to the Department, they sent back word that they had no wire. I went to Sydney, and discovered not only that they had no wire, but that the quantity under order would not have kept them going for more than a fortnight. I believe that in due time some wire did come to hand, and when I made fresh application for the construction of this line, I got the reply that the Department had no insulators. So we get one excuse after another. The figures given by the Postmaster-General, in answer to the question put to him last session, were a sufficient indication that the Department were getting behind with their work. The Postmaster-General told me here, two days before the session closed, that he was ashamed to give the House such an answer to the question. But since that time matters have gone from bad to worse. Necessary work that has been approved is piling up, and people have been waiting for years for necessary telephone lines. </para>

          <para>E. - That may be so, but it was not upon country telephone lines. The money was spent in undergrounding city lines, and I have no doubt that the work cost a good deal more than was anticipated. There are two centres in my electorate where butter factories have been established, and have applied for lines which have been approved. The population is increasing, and there is any amount of business waiting for the lines. Any one who knows anything about a butter factory will know that it must be in direct communication with a shipping centre, so that the managers may learn exactly when to ship their butter. This is particularly the case in the district to which I refer, where shipping is somewhat uncertain, owing to the state of the harbor. I hope the Government will endeavour to carry out these works expeditiously. They have the money, and all that is required is  a  little ordinary business management, to see that supplies of the necessary stores will be kept on hand. I can assure the Government they will have no difficulty in securing the necessary labour, if they will provide the material and a man to supervise the work. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that, but money might very easily be provided for the purchase of necessary supplies of material. One branch of telephone construction which should be encouraged is the trunk-line branch. I know of three or four trunk lines in my own constituency which have been- delayed, not because the Department have not been able to carry on the work of erecting the necessary poles, but because they have not had a sufficient supply of copper wire. I should- like the Minister to take note of a phase of telephone construction that requires more attention than has so far been given to it. I refer to the building of party, or private, telephone lines. We should encourage farmers and residents of sparsely-settled districts to erect private lines, and have them connected with the public lines in a district or with the local exchange. </para>

          <para>N.- Quite so. I am in a position to state that in quite a number of instances there have been undue delays on the part of the Department in having necessary agreements signed, arrangements made, and sanction given for the undertaking of works of this kind. There is another phase of telephone construction which requires reforming. I refer to the case where residents are prepared to contribute a certain proportion of a total cost of a line, either in material or cash, if the Department find that they are not justified in constructing the line under the guarantee system or as a public line. The Department declines to make any refund even when a line becomes payable, and earns full interest and working expenses ; and this seems to me to be an injustice. Every possible encouragement should be given to the construction of private lines; and this is a matter of serious import which should not be treated lightly. </para>

          <para>N. - Doubtless the Department has had a Herculean task in connexion with the construction of telephone lines, owing to the great number of applications from all parts of Australia, and it was only in  1909  that the honorable member for Bendigo,as Postmaster-General, initiated a bold policy of construction in connexion with the Post Office. The present Government have done much in the way of voting large sums of money, the bulk of which, I believe, has been properly expended in country districts ; but it is, perhaps, impossible for them to keep pace with growing requirements. Private telephone lines mean that money has not to be paid out of the Treasury, and that, in the future, so much money will not have to be borrowed as might otherwise be the case. I certainly think that, as the residents are prepared to take the risk to the extent of one-third or one-half of the cost of construction, there should be a refund in the case of the success of the line, for the Department derives the whole of the benefit of the revenue. There is no necessity for a subsidy from the people, for, in other cases, where a line shows an immediate prospect of paying, the Government bear the whole of the cost. Some time ago, when this matter was under discussion in connexion with some lines in Sydney, the Postmaster-General said, when I unsuccessfully moved an amendment, that he would like to look into the -matter, and try to liberalize the conditions. The amendment I then moved was to the effect that in the case of all those lines where a contribution had been made to the cost of erection by private persons or public bodies, and the lines had subsequently become paying lines, the Governor-General in Council should refund the full amount contributed. The request I make is a reasonable one, and I think it ought to be granted. </para>

          <para>K.- There is nothing in the Estimates to show that this  &#163;234,000  is for the purpose of providing silent telephones. Some ten years ago a Royal Commission, or the Public Works Committee of New South Wales, submitted a report showing what the cost of this conversion would be. I think that the cost was estimated at about  &#163;140,000.  We have spent, I should think, millions in Sydney alone in construction work of one kind and another since then, and the system is not as silent now as it was at that time. I know that it is a much bigger and more complex system, but it will not get any easier year by year unless a definite move on a bold scale is made to convert it at some point or other. I should like to know what is in the mind of the Department, as they go on from year to year putting down this new plant. Is it all done in preparation for a complete conversion of the whole system at some time or other? </para>

          <para>R.- As the Minister has promised to get the information I desire, I must be satisfied. I want now to refer to the answer which was given to me this afternoon by the Prime Minister, when I sought information regarding what is now known everywhere as &#34; the manonthejob.&#34; I, in common with other honorable members, was anxious to obtain from the right honorable gentleman information regarding this matter, which he considers as settled, simply because he read a report to the House, although he mentioned in a statement last week that it was the result of reports furnished by different inspectors. He takes it for granted, that because the report he read bears the signature of the  Deputy  PostmasterGeneral for Victoria that absolutely settles the matter. Surely we are entitled to know the names of the inspectors who made the reports on which that officer based his communication. I can easily understand that in diplomatic matters it might be advisable to suppress names in connexion with reports, but not where we are asked to vote the people&#39;s money in this way. Although accusations of a very strong character had been made by one of the leading journals of Melbourne, and also by honorable members supporting the Government, yet the Prime Minister refused to give the House the information on a matter which he contends is settled. That is, I think, slighting Parliament, to say the least of it. Surely the representatives of the people are entitled to know the basis of the report of the  Deputy  Postmaster-General. I object very strongly to being treated in this fashion. I hope the Prime Minister will see that we are as much entitled to know these names as he is. </para>

          <para>R. - The Prime Minister admitted sufficient to whet the appetite of honorable members for a good deal more information. I have reason to know that the Department concerned has in its possession written statements by inspectors and officers responsible for the conduct of this work which justify the allegations that were made. On the first opportunity to-day I asked ihe Prime Minister that the written statements of inspectors and other responsible officers in the possession of the Department might be laid on the table. The honorable member for Parkes, and, I think, another honorable member, urged the same request, but the right honorable gentleman refused to lay the information on the table. During twenty years of parliamentary experience, I have never known a Government to refuse to lay on the table documents relating to a matter on all-fours with this. There may be papers respecting negotiations not completed, which a Government is justified in withholding temporarily, but I have never known a refusal on all-fours with that under discussion. It was stated in Saturday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that a representative of that newspaper waited &#34;on a member of the Government, and asked to be allowed to see the papers, but was refused. The Prime Minister may plead justification for withholding the information from the press, though, in my view, his action was evidence of weakness ; but honorable members, in their representive capacity, have an absolute right to see these papers, and to know what complaints have been made, and how they have been dealt with. Why are Estimates submitted to Parliament if it is not for analysis and criticism, and how can the representatives of the people justify their election if Ministers will not inform them fully and clearly of the actual position of affairs when allegations are made such as have appeared in the press? What must be the result to the taxpayers of inefficiency in connexion with the public expenditure? We are asked to vote upwards of &#163;4,000,000 on public works, and I protest against the action of the Government in refusing our requests for information, which is unprecedented in the history of British Parliaments. </para>

There must be a curious reason for refusing this information. Evidently we are to have government by secret methods.

The Honorary Minister appears to think that it is a complete answer to the complaints which have been made regarding &#34; the man on the job &#34; to remind the honorable member for Darling Downs that some years ago a Government of which he was a member refused to reveal the proceedings of a Conference at which secret questions of finance were discussed. It has been said again and again that the charges have been looked into and explained. They have never been explained. Honorable members upon this side of the chamber have asked that the reports written by officers of the Department, and addressed to Ministers, should be laid on the table of the House in order that we may see what truth there was in the scandal which was pointed at the Government in connexion with this matter. They have refused to put those reports upon the table. </para>

They are afraid to do so. because, after repeated contradiction, they will stand condemned by their own officers. I am not talking without knowledge. I know from persons who&#39; have seen them, that there are in the Department reports which, if their contents were disclosed, would condemn the Government, and support the charges made.by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus.</inline> I again challenge the Government to produce them. In my thirty years of parliamentary life I have never heard of a Ministry refusing to lay public reports on the table of the House. I know that they are afraid to do so.

            <para>- That seems to be a reflection <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the Acting Government Whip. He did his best, under the circumstances, and if the honorable member for Newcastle had been present he could have done no more. But if we are expected to finish these Estimates to-night all I have to say is that there is no honorable member opposite who can stay here longer than I can. I think that the request made foi the production of the reports relating to the charges made by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is a reasonable one. I have never known official reports to be laid on the table of the House without the signatures of the persons who made them being attached to them. But what have we in this case? A covering letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright,</inline> the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, who is technically, but only technically, responsible for these reports. </para>

            <para>- I am addressing myself to these Estimates, and pointing out that the working man has to foot the bill. He is, therefore, interested in seeing that he gets full value for the money he has to pay, just as he has to give full value for the money he earns. That is a sound principle. We are entitled, in view of what has taken place, to have the reports of the responsible officers, with their names attached. Moreover, we are entitled to have the reports of the officers who were engaged in the supervision of the work in question at the time the alleged offences took place. They are the only men who can report responsibly. If the reports are favorable to the Government, why does not the Government make a triumph for itself by presenting them ? </para>

If they cannot be got out by the Select Committee asked for by the honorable member for Wakefield, they will come out some other way, I have no doubt. Facts like these cannot be kept back, however much the Government and their solid supporters may try to blink the matter; I say that we have a perfect right to know what the facts are. I have that right as a member of the public, and as  a  representative of Australia. When I ask for information concerning the expenditure of public money, I have a right to get it from the Government. It is said by honorable members who appear to know that there are reports in the office which condemn the work in question - </para>

          <para>K.- As a rule the Minister in charge of Estimates does give explanations on items. But during the consideration of these Estimates there appears to have been nothing of the kind. When things get a little sultry and awkward honorable members opposite put up one of their party to make a political speech, and to indulge in fireworks without reference to any particular matter. Honorable members opposite applaud, and there the whole thing ends. They do not desire any explanation. They do not care how the money goes as long as it does go, and is spent. They do not desire that the country shall have any information on the subject. They, therefore, applaud when these small political speeches, are being made, but the fact is that there has never been a Ministry that has furnished so little information as the present Government have done concerning a proposed expenditure of millions, such as that to which the Committee is now asked to agree. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to protest against the way in which the Committee has been treated in connexion with this matter. The Prime Minister has not only refused to give the information which hie has been asked again and again in this House to supply - he has not only refused to lay certain reports on the table of the House - but has read to us only portion of a report, and has suppressed a large portion of it. He did not read the whole of the report, and when he was requested once more to supply the information he walked out in a cavalier fashion, and, while in the gallery, said, in a loud tone of voice, &#34; I will leave someone else on the job.&#34; ,He should not treat the Committee in this way. </para>

          <para>E. - Yes, suppressed. It is quite evident that the publication of the reports would be against honorable members opposite, or against the Government; otherwise they would have been given to us at once. Very serious allegations we&#39;re made by a responsible newspaper - the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - allegations about workmen getting drunk; allegations of workmen assaulting those in authority over them, and other charges. In that part of the report read by the Prime Minister those allegations were not denied. Part of the report read by the Prime Minister bore out the charges made by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> but we have been refused full information upon the subject. The Prime Minister&#39;s action will reflect, not only upon him, but upon the Government, and the public will want to know as 1 do what is in these reports. </para>

          <para>ON.- It is. It shows that: our system of parliamentary government is being undermined, and that some other system unknown to responsible government, as the term is understood in the British Empire, is being substituted for it. I have never known or heard of an Opposition being treated as we are being treated by this uncouth Government. VVhen an honorable member on this side of the  House&#39; asks for information respecting any item of expenditure he is treated with contumely by Ministers, and is received with jeers by Ministerial supporters. How would honorable members opposite like to be treated in the same way if they were on this side of the House, and what sort of a time would a Government, no matter what its majority might be, have at their hands if they were in Opposition? I wish to institute a comparison between these items. The first item to which I refer reads, &#34; Construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduit and placing wires underground -  &#163;234,600.&#34;  We ask where these works are to be carried out, and we can get no reply. The next item is, &#34; New trunk lines,&#34; for which  &#163;20,600  is asked, and no information is afforded as to where they are to be erected. Because we request this information we are treated with scorn, and as if we were guilty of gross impertinence in asking how the money we are; asked to vote is to be expended. There is another item, &#34; Metallic circuits in existing single- wire networks -  &#163;&#91;17,850.&#34;  This is the amount asked for this service for New South Wales, but for the same service in Victoria no &#34;less than  &#163;98,500  is asked, although the population to be served in New South Wales is certainly very much greater than the population in Victoria. Surely it is reasonable that we should ask how this money is to be expended? We should be given some information also as to when the Government propose to establish silent telephones in New South Wales. The Minister who is supposed to be in charge of these Estimates is not paying the slightest attention to a word that is being said, and as a protest against this disgraceful way of dealing with, public expenditure I move - </para>

            <para>- I do not know how long the Government are prepared to accept the extremely humiliating position in which they have been placed. The Prime Minister has refused to lay on the table the reports of inspectors which have been asked for. The honorable member for Parkes has made a direct challenge to the Government. He says that he is in possession of information which enables him to say that if these reports are laid on the table the Government will stand condemned by their own officials. The Minister of External Affairs, with the supercilious air which he has so much affected recently, nods his head, but very few men occupying such a position would be content to nod their heads in that selfsatisfied fashion as the only answer to the direct challenge of&#34;the honorable member for Parkes. This is only on a par with the action of the Government when one of their own supporters this afternoon charged them with having &#34; nobbled &#34; an expert before he left Melbourne. </para>

There is the direct challenge, and if it were not true we know that the first thing the Government would do would be to lay the reports oh the table, in order to put the honorable member for Parkes in the position which he would deserve to occupy if his statement was not correct. If members of the Government had any sense of the dignity of their position they would not remain passive under such a challenge, but would see that the matter was sifted to the bottom. </para>

          <para>-  I rise to a point of order. In connexion with this very vote, the Prime Minister has read a report in this Committee, and the complaint is that that report is an inadequate one. I submit that the honorable member for Illawarra is perfectly in order in criticising the Prime Minister&#39;s action, and in contrasting it with that of Ministers who have held similar high office, and adopted a different attitude in relation to the expenditure of the people&#39;s money. If that be not fair debate, I should like to know what fair debate is. It is the complaint of the honorable member for Illawarra that the Prime Minister has given us no information concerning the amounts we are expected to vote. I submit that the honorable member for Illawarra is quite in order in instituting a comparison between the present Prime Minister and the State Premiers in connexion with the expenditure of public money. </para>

In the face of the deliberate and direct accusation of the honorable member for Parkes, any man who had a sense of responsibility and dignity, such as ought to be possessed by the Prime Minister of this country, would not hesitate for a moment to say that the matter must be probed to the bottom, if only for the sake of protecting his own honour. </para>

          <para>. - I appeal once more for a little information in regard to this huge item of &#163;800,000, or nearly &#163;1,000,000, in regard to which we have not heard a syllable from the Government.I desire to know what is the policy of the Department in regard to metallic circuits, a matter to which I referred last year, and the year before. At what period may we expect a big installation? The telephone system in Sydney gets worse every year ; it is more difficult now to get a satisfactory conversation than ever it was. I should be perfectly satisfied to hear that Ministers expect to bring about some radical alteration. Surely that is a matter on which we may very reasonably ask for an explanation of some sort or other. With what object are these huge sums being spent, and at what time may we expect a complete transformation of a system which is so unsatisfactory ? We are asked to vote &#163;17,850 for metallic circuits in existing singlewire networks for New South Wales. In many of the other States I believe they have this system. In </para>

        <para class="block">Queensland only a few pounds are to be spent in this direction ; a small amount is set down for South Australia, and a less amount for Tasmania; but in the worst place of all, so far as the utility of the telephone is concerned, there is practically nothing being spent to bring about the desired change. I should like to know from the Minister whether one of the bigger items in this subdivision is intended to achieve the result. There is nothing to indicate that that is the case, or what is being done by the Department in respect to making a reasonably silent system in Sydney in the near future. </para>

          <para>- I moved that this item be reduced by &#163;1 because there is a number of things which still require to be explained. I have been informed that the Minister himself will not give us any information. A sum of &#163;830,000 is involved, but we cannot get a word of information from the Minister in regard to any of the details, or even a general statement as to what the proposed expenditure covers. That is a most extraordinary position. Such a free-and-easy, slipshod way of dealing with public finances would not for a moment be tolerated in any public company or business concern. I do not think that in any other Parliament it could be possible. An honorable member informed me that he had reason to believe that a good deal of this expenditure, so far as Victoria is concerned, is intended to take place in the district of Wannon, whose representative sits behind the Minister perfectly silent, and who, I suppose, knows all about the matter. It was the honorable member for Bourke who gave me the information which I have imparted to the Committee. I do not think that he meant his communication to be regarded as confidential ; at any rate, he did not say so. I think that, if the honorable member for Wannon knows anything about the matter, he might come to the assistance of the Opposition, who are endeavouring to do their duty by the country, and give them the information which the Minister refuses to furnish, and, in order that he may have an opportunity to do so, I shall most cheerfully resume my seat and listen to his explanation. </para>

          <para>S. - Yes. There are metallic circuits connected with the big central exchange. What is needed in Sydney is the transfer of wires from the poles to the conduits, the work there being somewhat backward as compared with the Melbourne position. This year &#163;234,600 is asked for in order that the undergrounding of the telephone wires may be carried on more energetically and extensively. The undergrounding of the wires will materially improve the system. </para>

Six months for the mere binding and delivering of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is an unconscionably long time, and this delay occursevery year. When may we expect to have it remedied? Are we still relying on the State Govern ment to do the work of publishing <inline font-style="italic">Han sard,</inline> and, if so, is any step being taken to make us independent of it ? We have been told by the Minister that the reception of the redistribution scheme for New South Wales is being delayed because the printing of the maps is being done in the Sydney Government Printing Office, which is a State concern, where State work takes precedence. </para>

            <para>- I have personallyand so have other honorable members - referred to the delays which take place in the printing of particular information. An inquiry is now proceeding into the general methods of working the Department, and a report will be shortly furnished to the Ministry upon which possibly they may take some action. But it may be that they will decide to wait. Attention has previously been called to this delay. I recollect one occasion upon which it was necessary to obtain printing ata more rapid rate than it could be executed at the Government Printing Office, and accordingly the work was given to an outside office. An inquiry is now being made with a view to ascertaining the reasons for the delay, and of placing the whole position before the Ministry. Whatever the report of the Committee may be, I hope that more expedition will be shown in the future; if not, presumably the Minister will have to seriously consider the position in respect of printing generally. </para>

From official returns, I learn that in 1905 there were 686 rifle clubs in the Commonwealth, with a membership of 40,842 ; in 1909, there were 1,075rifle clubs, with a. membership of 53,926 - an increase in four years of 13,000; whilst in 1912, there were 1,120 rifle clubs, with a membership of 50,615 - a decrease of 3,300. I very much fear that this decrease in membership may be due to want of encouragement by the Government of these clubs. I do hope that the Ministry will this year remove the impression which exists that our rifle clubs have not the sympathy of the military authorities that they ought to have. </para>

            <para>- It is useless to inflate the Estimates if there be no prospect of expending the money. These miniature rifle ranges are very important, especially in view of the small amount of practice which our Junior Cadets are likely to get until they become older. As a matter of fact, nothing has been so neglected as the provision of facilities for rifle shooting. If our Cadets cannot shoot over the . big ranges, they must make the best possible use of the small ranges. Why is it that only &#163;154 was expended last year out of the &#163;4,090 appropriated, and is there this year a prospect of the whole amount of &#163;6,100 being spent? I wish also to know what is the meaning of the item &#34; Grants to rifle clubs for ranges.&#34; Are these private ranges which the Government subsidize ? I note that the item &#34; rifle ranges &#34; crops up everywhere in these Estimates. I should like an explanation as to whether this is money voted to the associations which control rifle shooting in the various States, or whether it is the usual grant made by the Government to rifle clubs direct. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to assure the honorable member for Wakefield that so far as I can gather as the result of investigation, there is really no antipathy on the part of the military authorities to our rifle clubs. The Minister of Defence is distinctly sympathetic, and desires to assist them to the very best of his ability. The item &#34; Grants to rifle clubs for ranges &#34; relates more particularly to clubs formed in country districts, where members of the Military Forces do not engage in rifle practice, and where, for all practical purposes, the clubs control the whole business. Whilst last year only &#163;4,259 was expended in this direction, we are asking this year for &#163;8,200, and the Minister has assured me that he is hopeful that the whole amount will be spent. The honorable member for North Sydney knows that there are many thousands of cadets in the Commonwealth, all of whom have rifles, and it is necessary that we should provide racks for the reception of these weapons when they are not in use. The fact that the cadets are required to put them away in these racks is indicative of a certain amount ofdiscipline and order, and  reminds  me of the saying of the old sailor who declared that there was a place&#39; for everything, and everything should be in its place. With the more accurate knowledge which we have gained since last year, we think that the expenditure of another &#163;1,000 will fully equip theForces in this particular direction. With regard to miniature rifles for cadets. I regret that only &#163;154 was expended last year. The reason for that was that what were considered to be more important features in the development of the cadet movement were given first consideration. As to miniature rifle ranges, the Department was somewhat at a loss to know precisely where they should be placed, and how they should be controlled.  Now it has been decided that they shall be at the schools, and the Minister is desirous that they shall be established at the earliest possible moment. The boys themselves are also keen. I hope that the money to be voted will be expended before the financial year expires. </para>

Is it intended to rely entirely upon that establishment for rifles this year? Last year  &#163;4,000  was put down towards the establishment of an aviation corps. Can the Minister inform us what steps are being taken this year in that direction ? Is any money proposed to be spent on aviation ? </para>

          <para>- The Lithgow Factory is at present manufacturing rifles, and many thousands of parts have already been finished, though none have been assembled. It is not expected that any rifles manufactured at Lithgow will be ready for use by the troops during the current calendar year; but by next year some may be ready. As far as I know, cadet rifles are not being manufactured at Lithgow. It is estimated that  &#163;&#91;1,000  will be sufficient for cadet rifles this year. As to aviation, the Minister of Defence has been successful in securing the services of two experts, and they have been appointed. The reports concerning them are excellent. They are believed to be able men. The Minister has not yet undertaken the purchase of machines. He will obtain the advice of his experts before doing so. </para>

          <para>. - I observe that  &#163;&#91;300,000  is to be voted for harness and saddlery, with other war-like stores. Does that mean that we are going to purchase harness and saddlery from outside sources? We have established a factory for the manufacture of such equipment, and a considerable sum of money has been voted for the purpose. I do not know how far the Government propose to supply accoutrements for the troops. If it is intended to buy harness and saddlery, we ought to have an explanation, because the understanding was that we should manufacture our own. We have a building and plant. Why, then, is this item required? </para>

          <para>. - I am not aware that an item for saddlery and harness appears twice over: There was an item in connexion with the Home Affairs Department, but it had to do with the building in which saddlery and harness is to be manufactured. The item now referred to deals particularly with the purchase of harness and saddlery. Even if we manufacture our own it has to be accounted for and paid for in the ordinary way. Moreover, contracts are in existence with outside firms for the supply of these accoutrements, and those firms are still fulfilling orders. Payment has to be made to them. This item is a portion of an item required to equip the whole of our Forces up to a war standard. Nearly  &#163;300,000  was spent last year. We ask for a similar amount this year, and it is estimated that about  &#163;100,000  will be required next year, by the expenditure of which the whole of the Forces, so far as arms, accoutrements, ammunition, stores, &#38;c, are concerned, will be placed upon a war footing. </para>

            <para>- It would be necessary to have this depot completed before immigrants were brought out, yet the item is only &#34;towards cost&#34; of building it. Why not complete the immigrants&#39; depot if it is proposed to bring out immigrants for the Northern Territory during the year? If that is not the intention of the Minister, why does he ask for this vote? My own impression is that there will not be an immigrant for the Northern Territory during the present financial year. Much remains to be done before the Government attempt to invite immigrants to go into these tropical latitudes, and to begin to push them up there before we wereready to receive them would be to invite disaster. </para>

          <para>. - Those who have visited Port Darwin must realize that it would be useless to ask people to go to the Northern Territory unless we had at that port some place in which they could be housed until they went inland. There is practically no accommodation at present, because, although there are two or three hotels at Port Darwin, they are always full. Our idea is to erect a building where people - whether they come from the southern States or from any other part of the world - can be housed until they go inland. I think the work will cost more than &#163;2,000, but I venture to say that we shall not be able to spend more than that amount during the present year. I should be very glad if we could, but I am afraid that, owing to the difficulties intimately associated with the Northern Territory, we shall not be able to spend more than the amount for which the item provides. </para>
