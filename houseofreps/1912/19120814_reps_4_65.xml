          <para>. - I hope that in acknowledgment of: this generous treatment by the Opposition, Ministers will, when the Bill is before us, have a little more information to give than we were able to get last night, when I had to protest quite a number of times about the paucity of the information available. Never in my parliamentary career have I known Ministers to have so little information to give in explanation of Works Estimates. If Ministers themselves possessed the information, they suppressed it; but in some cases I had to correct misleading statements made by the Minister at the table. </para>

There never before has been so full a discussion as has taken place on the present Estimates. I do not seriously object to that. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the paragraph referred to by the honorable member, and, if its statements are correct, there is some misunderstanding in New South Wales regarding prosecutions. Instructions were sent out some time ago to the District Commandants, directing that prosecutions be shaped in conformity with the provisions of the Bill that has passed the Senate and is now before honorable members. The instructions were clear and definite, and to the effect that where a lad had put in fifty-four of the sixty-four hours required for the year&#39;s drill, and would give his personal undertaking to do the remaining ten hours, no prosecution of any kind should be commenced ; though, if he would not give that undertaking, some action was necessary. Where cadets were more than ten hours short, prosecutions were to take place, but in such cases the magistrate was to be specifically requested to accept the personal assurances of the lads that they would put in the necessary time, and then no punishment or fine of any description was to be inflicted. In addition, it was an instruction of the Minister that no legal assistance should be given. Furthermore, the Attorneys-General of the States were asked <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> our Attorney-General to communicate the wishes of this Government to their magistrates. The AttorneysGeneral of five States agreed to do this, but the Attorney-General of South Australia refused point blank to convey any such message to the magistrates of that State. </para>

              <para>- There is no obligations so far as the magistrates are concerned;: what was done was merely as an extra precaution. The instructions to the prosecuting officers in the various States were most clearSo far as expediting the passage of the legislation is concerned, my answer is that the Minister is <inline font-style="italic">most</inline> anxious that this should&#34; be done. I may say that I have been almost bursting with the desire to. speak on this question, but I have been prevented owing; ta&#39;thaiei&#39;rgtb-ofs time occupied. bythe,Oppo&#62; sition on the Works and Buildings Estis mates. </para>

          <para>. - I desire the Minister of External Affairs to give some information with respect to an item incidentally mentioned at an early hour this morning. It had reference to the question of the adoption of the gauge for railway construction in the Northern Territory. A small sum of four thousand pounds odd appears in the Estimates tor the survey of a railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, and when it was asked on what gauge the survey was to be based, the answer was &#34;the  4-ft. 8J-in.  gauge.&#34; At present there is a direct railway line from Port Augusta as far as Ooodnadatta on the  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge. The Commonwealth has taken this over with its liabilities, and it represents to us a value in all of  ,&#163;2,242,000  of loan money. There is also a line from Darwin to Pine Creek, in the Northern Territory, representing in all, with the harbor improvements,  ^1,184,612.  These two lines represent a very large sum of money ; and the alteration of their gauge will be a very serious proposition for the Commonwealth. The  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge has been adopted in Queensland. Very large railway extensions are being made in Queensland at the present time, and it is also suggested that the New South Wales Government should run a line out west, towards the Queensland border, where it would connect with the line to be constructed by Queensland, which will run from the south of that State right away to the north. If that scheme be carried out, then, when the line running through western Queensland to the South Australian border is completed, and the Northern Territory line is constructed, we shall also have direct communication with that Territory, through Queensland and New South Wales. I am not suggesting that the people of South Australia should not get the railway to which they are entitled under the agreement made with them. My own opinion is that we shall ultimately see three railway systems in the Northern Territory. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. We must have ultimately, if only for defence purposes, a line connecting the Northern Territory with Western Australia, and, no doubt, the South Australian railway system will also be connected with the Territory, and there will be also the connexion with the Queensland system. We should fulfil our compact with South Australia, but, in building our railways in the Northern Territory, we must pay attention also to natural avenues of trade and commerce.

          <para>. - - I wish to add my  voice to that of  the &#39; honorable -member for Echuca in recording dissatisfaction  with &#39; the very unbusinesslike way &#39;in -which  i  the Northern Territory -question &#39;is being dealt -with. It  is generally acknowledged that our  commitments in regard to &#39; the &#39; Northern &#39; Territory are &#39;about  ^iri-jOoojooo,  so &#39;that .&#39;the- settlement and government of the Territory is- really our largest enterprise. &#39;&#39;Yet &#39;the &#39;-Government seem &#39;to have -no definite policy in  Tegard  to -it. If&#39; Ministers :say- -openly-&#39; that  they  have&#39;-Tiot had&#39; time- to&#39; determine what to do, the &#39;country &#39;will know &#39;how we stand; but if &#39;they  have -any plan,  we should &#39;know  what  they propose. &#39;.At present, all* we know is that they have- adopted -an impracticable .-scheme for &#34;settlement by- refusing to grant freehold estates -to &#39;those  who ore expected. to leave the-more civilized&#39;-partsof Australia to settle in tfee Territory. Like many-other ^honorable .members, I^annof opinion..  that-  the ileasehorid -system&#39; wilh! not induce-&#39;populationcto ieave. the&#39; more attractive &#39;. districts,  where :ifae-.\tdimate&#60;\is -good, and. life,- energy, and enterprise .abound, tfo go to a remote and tropical district. We have taken over from South Australia railways that we are running at a loss, but no proposal has been made for extending the line from Pine Creek either immediately or in the future. If Australia were a national Crcasus a liability of ;&#163;i  1,000,000  might not give us any great concern, but to a young country this is a very large matter. The people would be astonished if they knew that the Government have no definite policy in regard to the Northern Territory. If there is a policy, we should know it, and should have an opportunity to criticise it before a penny is spent on the Northern Territory. Until Parliament is prepared to indorse a policy, money should not be expended there. The honorable member for Darling _ Downs made a reference to the Queensland railway gauge, but I hope that Ministers will not promise to depart from the standard gauge which we have resolved shall apply to all the railways constructed or controlled by the Commonwealth. The State of New South Wales happens to have adopted the  4  ft.  8^-in.  gauge, which is recognised by engineers throughout the world as the standard gauge, and is used by most of the big railway companies. </para>

            <para>- Victoria has another gauge, and Victoria is the world to the honorable member, but in the ordinary acceptation, of the term the world&#39;s standard gauge is the  4  ft.  8  J-in. gauge, which is therefore more economical and convenient than any other. I hope that the Government will not be beguiled by the representation of any State to depart from that gauge. When the Northern Territory question was under discussion, it was suggested that the South Australian Government should be asked to sanction a deviation of the transcontinental railway to the east, so that it might pass through land of a better quality than would be traversed by a direct route, and might be connected with the Queensland, New South Wales, and Victorian systems at less expense. Of what is to be done in that matter we have heard nothing. Although in regard to many small enterprises the Government shows great activity, it has allowed months to pass without formulating a policy regarding an undertaking which commits the country to an expenditure equalling halfayear&#39;s revenue. In the meantime, it is maintaining railways on which it loses money. I hope that Ministers will take the matter up, and say definitely for the information of the public what they intend to do. </para>

          <para>.- This is a very tempting opportunity to discuss the Northern Territory, but I do not intend to do so on this occasion.- I desire merely to call the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to the fact that, according to the answer given to a question to-day, a new regulation has been issued raising the qualification of an official office from a revenue of  ^200  to a revenue of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;300.</inline> When the question of penny postage was before us, the present Minister of External Affairs promised that country post-offices would not suffer as a result of any reduction in the revenue, and that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> would be the maximum required to establish an official office. I do not know who is responsible for the new arrangement, but it is a distinct breach of faith and a grave injustice to country districts and sparsely-populated areas. It is difficult enough to attain to an official office with revenue of <inline font-style="italic">jQzoo,</inline> and 0 the difficulty, of course, is intensified if the maximum is increased. I do not intend to let this matter rest, because I believe there is a majority of honorable members who agree that the new regulation is an absolute imposition. </para>

If we have a statement from the Minister that country offices are to be placed at no disadvantage as a result of penny postage, no official outside this House should have the right to reverse the policy stated on behalf of the Government.

          <para>. - The Government might as well at the same time let us know what policy they have in relation to the Federal Capital area. A very large expenditure is going on, and the Government ought to adopt some definite plan. I am not cavilling at the officers, who have done very well ; but I think the time has arrived when we should have a Commission or Committee of Public Works, such as is found in some of the States. We are asked to spend this year only from ^100,000 to ^150,000, but this is the foundation of ati expenditure of millions,; and we ought to have some continuity of policy. There are railways, electric works, water and sewerage works, and so forth ; and up to the present the Minister of Home Affairs is left practically a monarch to do as he likes. We have resumed 85,000 acres of land ; and as there will doubtless be a big revenue presently, some policy ought to be laid down. There is some doubt in regard to the route of the railway from the Capital to Jervis Bay, and representations have been made to the effect that by an alteration of the route nearer to Braidwood, there could be tapped a big timber country with large deposits of coal. Strong statements have been made regarding the resources from which electric power can be obtained ; and it is contended that sufficient power can be obtained from the Shoalhaven River near Marulan to supply the Capital and all the railways. Who is going to fix the route of the railways? Has it to be the Mhv ister, or are we to have these public works supervised and investigated as in some of the States. We have been going . along in a very haphazard way, leaving everything to the Minister. The honorable gentleman is, of course, advised by his Secretary, but that gentleman resides in Melbourne, and visits the Territory only once a month&#39;. He or some other official ought to be kept in the Territory all the time, because the works there are sufficient to warrant the supervision of one or more men. There ought to be some Committee or Commission appointed. </para>

            <para>- It would be better to have a number of Committees than to go on in the way we are now going. Is the Prime Minister, with his reputation for caution, satisfied with our present method under which no one seems to assume absolute responsibility? Wild charges are made of men being intoxicated, and not doing their work. </para>

            <para>- There is no doubt that men, whether working on day labour or under contract, will have a whisky if they can get it; but, as I say, I do not believe these charges. The Minister of Home Affairs has done, and is doing, good work; but I object to his being a king not only in name, but in reality - to his being in a position where he has simply to wave his hand, and say, &#34; Do it,&#34; and the thing is done. Notwithstanding all the hard things that are said about the honorable gentleman, I believe he has done good work, and .approached this matter in a business-like way ; but he ought to be relieved of some of his present responsibility. He has enough &#39; to do to look after the work at his office, and, as I said before, there ought to be a Committee of some kind appointed. At present, I am a sort of unofficial representative in this House of the people of the Capital area. At the present time no one can say when those who have sold their land- will get their money. Under the Act, they have to go to the High Court to get the values fixed, if they are not satisfied ; but the Prime Minister has promised that some sort of intermediary local tribunal shall be appointed. </para>

            <para>- Quite so; but they are being embarrassed by the delay, which is serious in view of the fact that many of them desire to make fresh homes. We cannot expect the Prime Minister or the Minister of Home Affairs to have time to give ail these matters their personal attention, and, though they no doubt mean to carry out their promises, their hands are too full already. If necessary, let us make the Minister a Commissioner; at any rate, let us. have some local government in the Capital area. As I say, there is some doubt whether the railway to Jervis Bay . ought not to tap some big timber country which is spoken of. Who is to settle the route of the railway? </para>

Why should these people&#39; be taxed? The Minister of Home Affairs  his  told us&#39; that he is making money out of titer Territory,- and &#39;that the -resumption! &#39;oft land will pay. I believe-the Minister -will make money- out- of the- Territory, but&#39; &#39;the men out- of wtoomhe is making it ought to have some say in this House with regard to taxation. If we are not to have a Committee  or  Commission to decide - on* the route of the- railway from- the- Capital to the coast, the Minister should have the .re* ports on- the -different- routes laid- on- the table of the House, so that honorabre menrbers can see for themselves  which is1 the best.

Under the New South Wales law, the State Savings Bank cannot lend money outside the State. Loans have been made to residents inside the Federal Territory, which has been declared outside the State. The bank has notified the people there that they cannot renew the loans, and cannot give them fresh, ones. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps the Prime Minister has that in his mind now. He says very fairly that he will meet any genuine cases that arise. It is a great anomaly that 2,000 people living in the Federal Territory should be Ishmaelites, as it were. They have to apply to the Minister of Home Affairs to know what they are to pay for water or lighting, and they have nothing settled. A man inside the Federal Territory does not know what he is to get for his land, who is to fix the values, whether he will have to go to the High Court to fight the matter if he does not like the values, or when he will be paid, and at the same time he cannot go anywhere else. This matter must affect us as Australians, because it involves a great principle. I urge the Government to do something to give these men, not only representation, but some consideration in the shape of a definite policy, .so that .they will not be handicapped in any way, or have withheld from them the privileges which other citizens enjoy. </para>

          <para>. -The interest displayed in the welfare of the Northern Territory by honorable members opposite, and more particularly by the honorable member for Darling Downs and the honorable member for Parkes, must be refreshing to the House and gratifying to the residents of the Northern Territory, as well as to all who are anxious for its advancement. Standing by itself, it would appear to be very good, but we have had the further information given to us that an agreement has been made by the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, under which it&#39; is intended to construct in New South Wales a 4-ft. ^inline, to connect with the Queensland system, so that ample opportunity will be afforded for the trade of the Northern Territory to &#34;flow to its nearest port,&#34; and so forth. This information is deeply interesting, and I hope that it will be very carefully considered by the Government when they are determining their policy iri regard to the Northern Territory. As to what that policy is to be, we have only the very slight indication furnished by the appearance on these Estimates of an item of ,&#163;5,000 to provide for a survey for a proposed extension&#39; of the Pine Creek railway to the Katherine River.  I do not say that the Government have made up their minds in. this respect, but straws in the air sometimes indicate which way the wind is blowing. What I do hope is that there will be no&#34; scheming on the part of any of the States to obtain an advantage in respect of the trade of the Territory before the Territory itself is opened up. In the interests, not only of the Northern Territory, but of Australia as a whole, it is essential that the Territory should first of all be opened up and developed. I do not think it is going to be a sink for Commonwealth moneys, as the honorable member for Echuca has suggested ; but it certainly will be if the State Rights&#39; brigade &#34;gerrymander &#39; &#39; a policy for the purpose of diverting a trade that -is not yet created, but which, after millions have been wasted, would probably be enjoyed by certain States against the interests of the rest of the Commonwealth. That sort of game is very amusing. </para>

          <para>. - I have no doubt that my honorable friend is very earnest, and very honest, straightforward, and outspoken. In short, I have no* doubt that he is the one man in the House who takes a &#34;broad national view &#34; of all these questions. Every one knows, however, that he has an eye on his own State all the time. Indeed, it may oe set down as a rule in this House that an honorable member who protests most vigorously, and, apparently, whole-heartedly, that some one else is taking a &#34; parishpump &#34; view, is, in reality, speaking with his own mouth full of &#34; parish-pump &#34; water. Here we have another instance of the kind. The honorable member has been attributing motives to the people of certain States and asserting that they want to &#34;gerrymander&#34; a railway, and that they desire to divert the trade of the Northern Territory from its natural courses. I have heard of no such scheming and no such scheme. There is a natural anxiety on the part of the taxpayers that we shall begin our process of Northern Territory development on proper lines ; that the work of development shall start from some -centre which will give the Territory the greatest and freest access to the markets of Australia, and so provoke reciprocal trade, which will help us. to look forward to the time when it will be self-supporting, and a buttress to, rather than a burden upon, the rest of Australia. The honorable member should cease these ridiculous innuendoes of his, unless he is prepared to furnish some substratum of solid information as to the existence of such schemes. I know of no such scheme as he suggests to the House, more by insinuation than by straight-out frank statements. What I do know is that we have a proposal by this Government to construct a section of the Northern Territory railway from the north downwards. If that is to be the extent of the survey, it appears to me that it will be a very ridiculous one. Before entering upon a survey of the kind, the Government should have definite plans as to the route to be taken, and as to where they are going to look for a way out. What is the good of carrying the Pine Creek railway to the Katherine River, unless we proceed further and know in what direction it is proposed to go? What is the use of merely carrying the railway to the Katherine River, and so adding enormously to the already large debts we have taken over in connexion with the Territory? If all the produce developed by such a railway is to go up north, where will it go when it reaches there? These are questions that we need to put to ourselves. If the honorable member would ask them, he would do very much better than he does by throwing out insinuations regarding representatives of other States, who may be just as patriotic as he -is to Australia as a whole. What motive can, we have but to develop the Northern Territory on lines that will make it a paying proposition, and enable it to go on its own way adding to the material prosperity, security, and safety of Australia? But to throw a proposal like this before the House, as the Government have done, and to leave it without a word of explanation, is to be guilty of one of &#39; those mysterious actions which I do not pretend to understand in connexion with the present Administration. Instead of criticising his own Government, which he follows so slavishly and blindly - instead of criticising the Government which are doing this apparently wooden -headed. thing - the honorable member tries to divert attention to some one else.  His  own Government are responsible for what is being done, and that is the first fact to which he should direct his attention. </para>

            <para>- There speaks this great nationalist ! There speaks the Caucus party devotee, who is covering up his own tracks as a blind, sordid supporter of this Government in anything and everything they do, whether it be against his State or not ! There speaks the man who is trying to throw dust in the eyes of his own electors by referring in this insinuating way to members of others States, and accusing them of all the political crimes in the calendar. The honorable member had better look to himself. If any -one is to blame for this patchwork business - if patchwork it be - his own Government most assuredly is. They are spending money on a partial survey, and will not even give the House any explanation. They will not say what is in their minds. I suggest that the honorable member for Hindmarsh is grossly unfair in belabouring honorable members as he has been doing, while all the time his trouble U nearer home in connexion with his own Caucus and his own Government. This House ought to have a full explanation of the purpose of the Government with regard to surveys of developmental lines.  1  am not so sure that I do not agree with my honorable friend, that we ought to begin at another spot rather than where we propose in our process of developing the Territory. </para>

            <para>- I did not say where we should start. The very first step we ought to take is to set the experts at work, and not to dictate to them as to where they shall commence their operations. I should select the best men I could get - men in whose judgment I had the most implicit reliance - of the best calibre that could be obtained in the Commonwealth, and I would say to them, &#34; Find us the best route for developmental railways. Give us the benefit of your judgment as to where the survey should begin.&#34; Instead of doing what the present Government are doing, I would ask them to direct me as being better informed - as knowing more about this business than I could possibly do owing to my want of training. In other words I would get about me the best ability I could command in the continent for the purpose of making proper surveys, and investigating the country through which those surveys passed. My honorable friend may well leave the Opposition alone in this matter. He will find that they are as patriotic as he is. He will find that they are just as ready as he is to observe the broad lines of the bargain that has been made with his own State - and made, as I think, much to the advantage of South Australia. He certainly will not promote his cause by making insinuations and attributing unworthy motives to men who are as anxious as he is that the Territory shall be developed on right lines, and quite as anxious as he is to do the best for the Commonwealth which we are all here to serve. </para>

          <para>.- I have been rather struck by the attack made this, afternoon by honorable members of the Opposition on the administration of the Northern Territory. The honorable member for Echuca began by attacking the Government for expending any money whatever in the Territory, and he was followed by the honorable member for Parkes, who complained very bitterly of the fact that this Parliament had made itself responsible for an indebtedness of &#163;11,000,000 in respect of the taking of that&#39; Territory from South Australia. This Government has had control of the Territory for practically only twelve months, and is endeavouring now to do what the Tories, Liberals, and Fusions of South Australia neglected to do in the past. The honorable member for Parkes expects this Government to say in detail what it is going to do with a Territory whose area is, I suppose, fifteen times that of Victoria, but, as a matter of fact, we are proceeding in a business-like way, and are providing for works necessary for its settlement and progress. Objection has been taken to the proposal to expend &#163;4,000 on a railway survey, but the remaining ,&#163;50,000 odd is for works that are urgently needed, which the Tories of the past have neglected to carry out. The expenditure proposed is to make ready for the reception of a population. That is the first .step to take. The sum of &#163;3,000 is to be spent on additions to buildings, while for the Darwin Hospital <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,650 is</inline> asked; for artesian water bores, ^2,000 ; for houses for Government employes, .&#163;21,000; for quarters for the guard of the gaol at Fanny Bay, &#163;625 ; for workshops and fittings, ,&#163;1,100; for the survey of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River, ,&#163;4,200; for the erection and equipment of a steam laundry <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i,&#176;&#176;o;</inline> for a new public school at Darwin, .&#163;1,500; for another school at Brock&#39;s Creek, &#163;365 ; for a police station, &#163;500 ; for a court-house and warden&#39;s office at Pine Creek, ,&#163;600; for a public works store, &#163;^4,000; for additional office accommodation, ,&#163;4,000 ; - and for well sinking and water conservation, .&#163;3,000. Are not all these, and the other undertakings which are provided for, necessary? Is population to flock to the Northern Territory and no provision to be made for it? The Government has engaged  a  Geologist, a Director of Lands, a Chief Surveyor and staff, an Administrator, and a Judge, and is now looking for an Inspector of Mines. It has also sent  a  doctor to Darwin, to clean up the pestilence that the Liberals, Tories, and Fusions of the past handed over to us with the Territory. What I have heard of in that connexion is not fit to describe.  This Government is accused of having no policy, but it knows its duty, and is endeavouring to make Port Darwin  a  little cleaner. </para>

            <para>- To hear from persons who have been to Port Darwin what has taken place there is shocking, and thi* state of things remained while the Territory was under the control of the Government of South Australia.  The Labour Administration of that State, however, had no responsibility in the matter. What, more could the Opposition have done, had it been in power?  .1  doubt if .it would have done half as much. Members opposite sat on the Ministerial benches for ten years, but it was necessary for this Government to come into power to accomplish the taking over of the Territory. We are blamed for not proposing large expenditure on railways in the Northern Territory, and, at the same time, the Fusion press is attacking the Labour party for its extravagance. How can we please our critics opposite? The honorable member for Parkes desires the 4-ft. S^in. gauge, while the honorable member for Darling Downs wishes for a 3-ft. 6-in gauge for the railways of the Territory. The Government has done all that it can in the time at its disposal. It has appointed experts to report as to the best means of developing the Territory, and next year, if still in power, as I believe it will be, it will have proposals to make to Parliament. If the Government formulated a policy before its experts had made inquiries, and furnished reports and recommendations, the Opposition would declare that that policy wanted ground to sustain it. Honorable members opposite appear to me to talk for the sake of talking. They accuse us of not spending enough, and, in the same breath, with being too lavish. What can we do to please them? </para>

            <para>- He was replying to a very warm speech from the other side. It is the unanimous desire of honorable members that a policy for the development of the Northern Territory should be formulated at the earliest moment on a sound basis. We all recognise die enormous responsibility devolving on us in this matter ; but, like the honorable member for Parramatta, I must protest against proposals for expenditure about which we have no information, especially the proposal to spend money on railways. We have already had occasion to complain of the adoption of a system of land tenure without regard to the opinions of Parliament, and now we are being committed to a railway policy which, so far as we know, forms no part of a general scheme of development and settlement. Railways, of course, are necessary, but the money will be wasted if they are not constructed in accordance with a de finite scheme. It has been contended by South Australian representatives that a transcontinental line should be constructed through their State, while many other honorable members think that the Territory would be better served by a line going through the eastern States. This conflict of opinion is evidence of the need for an investigation by an independent body, which could make recommendations on the subject to Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I conclude that it is so, though I do not know the fact &#34; full well.&#34; 1 am taking this opportunity to protest against the absence of any general scheme of public works,- including railways ; but, as I say, an exception might be made of this section of railway, if we understand it to be part of the main trunk line. I am not prepared to say, in the absence of the fullest information, whether this main trunk line should run from the coast southward, or from South Australia at Oodnadatta northward, but our first duty is to formulate a scheme to develop the resources of the Territory, and for the construction of railways to carry the produce to the coast, so that it may be carried to the London and other markets. Most of the products that will be generally :grown in the Territory we are already overproducing in the southern parts pf Australia. We hope that, the Territory will become one of the greatest stockraising and dairying centres in Australia. </para>

            <para>- Meat and butter form the great proportion of our export business, which enables us to pay the interest on the cost of our public works. Before we are called upon to vote any further sums for the construction of public works in the Northern Territory, we ought to be able to review a fully developed scheme, so that we may know how the money is to be expended, and the probable results. From what I gathered when travelling in a portion of the Northern Territory, I think the railway should, in the first instance, be run from the- coast inland, so that the interior may be developed. The possibility of making this a settled country will depend on the encouragement given to the growth of products that have chiefly to be sent to the markets of the world. I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro with regard to the P&#39;ederaj. Capital area. It seems to me that the honorable member touched a very important point. This Territory is part of our Commonwealth properties, and it has been stated by some honorable members that there is a chance of developing an agricultural community there. There is poor land, and land of average quality; but in the long run there is the possibility of a large number of agricultural settlers. If this be so, the , Government could give a tremendous im- . petus to settlement by the establishment of-, the Credit Foncier system in connexion with the Commonwealth Savings Bank, as has;.i been done in connexion with some of. the*5 State Savings Banks. I can conceive of .. no better way of investing the funds of the bank than enabling settlers in the Federal area to borrow freely on a safe basis. According to the Constitution, this land must remain the property of the Government, and doubtless special legislation would be required to enable money to be lent on lease- . hold properties; at any rate, some financial.* assistance ought to be given with a view to . encouraging new settlers, and also with view .to relieving the financial tension no\i being experienced by a large number of people already there. _ </para>

            <para>- We all desire some system of local government, because it is only right that people who pay taxation should have representation. There are, of course, great difficulties in the way which have not yet been solved, but their solution is a matter of growth and evolution. In South Australia, Western Australia,, and Victoria, the State Governments have found it a safe plan to lend out, not large sums, but small sums, on their own land, mostly on the security of the improvements and the added value given by the industry of the occupiers. These advances have generally been repaid, and some such scheme might be introduced with benefit in the Federal Territory. </para>

          <para>.- I was rather amused to hear the honorable member for Parramatta make a very strong demand for the appointment of experts in the Northern Territory, and his expressions of faith that the advice of those experts- would be followed, especially in view of the fact that, during the last . fortnight, honorable members, particularly honorable members opposite - though there are several on the Government side - have done nothing but condemn the decision arrived at by the expert selected to advise as to the site for the Woollen Mills. </para>

            <para>- There is no doubt about that. As to the railways in the Northern Territory, if the honorable member for Hindmarsh required any confirmation of his fears, I think he got it in the speech of the honorable member for Parramatta. There is no need for the honorable member for Hindmarsh to be told that he is hinting, and that he ought to come out with what he means. We all know, as can be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that when the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was before us this very question was dealt with. I am referring now to the desire of the representatives of the eastern States that the railway which should develop the Territory shall be diverted in order to develop the back portions of those States. I have no fault to find with the proposed railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, because this line must be part of the main line, whichever route the latter may take. The Minister has made a statement to that effect in this House on more than one occasion. Last year when the matter was discussed, the Minister told us that he would have a survey made of the extension of the line to Katherine River, and that this would form part of the main line, whether this went east or due south. The fault I find with the Government on this occasion is that they give no hint of their intention to develop that immense part of the Territory which lies to the south. One would think that the Territory consists entirely of the country in the north ; the Government seem to forget altogether the land about the MacDonnell Ranges and a little further north, which has &#39; been described as excellent pastoral and mineral land, suitable for the habitation of white people. This part of the Territory can be developed only by the extension of the railway from Oodnadatta north ; and we ought to have a proposal from the Govern-: ment to survey a line from that place to, at: least the MacDonnell Ranges, simultaneously with the proposal to survey theline from Pine Creek to the KatherineRiver. </para>

            <para>- If so, there is no excuse fori the Government not providing in the Estimates for the extension I have indicated.. To suggest that the line from Pine Creek, to the Katherine River shall be turned off towards Queensland, and then connected with the New South Wales railways, is te* deliberately ignore the Northern Territory,; and leave the greater portion of it without any attempt at development. This, to my&#39; mind, is a matter of the most serious; moment, and the longer it is left unattended* to &#34;the greater will be the loss to the community, and the longer the Territory will: remain undeveloped. I hope to see the -lines continued as nearly north and south as possible, and ultimately connected up with extensions both from Queensland andi New; South Wales. . . </para>

          <para>-^ Although the Government have expressed a; desire to get these Estimates through asi quickly as possible, they are going theright way to get them through as slowly aspossible. I have no great objection to any-: of these items for the Northern Territory^: but they ought to have been accompanied by some general scheme. If the Minister of External Affairs has not had time to prepare a scheme - and it is quite possible that he has not, because it will take the officers who were recently appointed a long time to get accustomed to their surroundings - he should tell the House so. If he would: only say that at some particular period - say, three months from now - he proposes to put a full scheme of development before Parliament, I think members on this? side would be satisfied, but we cannot get a word out of him. Will he assure the House that these works are simply of atentative character, and that before the enormous expenditure foreshadowed is entered upon a general scheme for develop-, ing this great Territory, which is one of the most difficult problems before Australia, will be put before Parliament? If he said so, it would give members some sort of confidence. I am inclined to agree that there will have to be far more&#39;than one line of railway through the Territory. The line from north to south appears to have its uses, and I agree with the honorable member for Gippsland that one of the first steps  Ought  to be to continue the existing line at least down to Macdonnell Ranges. We hear glowing wordopictures of this country, and the Government ought to verify them. If their officers are satisfied that the Macdonnell Ranges country is what it is described to be, there will  be  no excuse for not continuing the line to that point. If we have country of that sort not so very far distant from Darwin, . why not make  a  start in developing it? It might  be a  stepping stone toward the further development of this great Territory. This is a broad national question concerning every State, and we ought to have an assurance that some day a proper scheme of development will be put before us. </para>

Some of them have borrowed money, and their bankers will say to them, &#34; You are in a most extraordinary position ; your security is damaged, and we do not know what our security is.&#34; Naturally, they will be pressed for payment, and the outlook is very bad for them. 1 hope the very first action of the present Socialistic Government towards the few Commonwealth subjects they have will not be to cause them great distress. We were promised that such advantageous terms would be given to all on Commonwealth Territory that people would flock there, but these people have been put into a most precarious position, and should be removed from it as soon as possible. They have to pay taxes, and they have no representation. Some form of government must be given to the residents in both the Federal Territory and the Northern Territory. </para>

I am not aware of their financial position, but they may have loans in respect of their properties, and the Minister will recognise that difficulty is likely to arise if he does not press on with this work. I know that there are complicated legal proceedings in connexion with the resumption of land, and that valuations must also be made; but the matter should be taken in hand at once. </para>

          <para>. -  There seems to be a constant moaning on the part of the Opposition. I do not know of one matter that has been brought before the House this session concerning which the Opposition have not complained that the information furnished is insufficient to enable them to come to an intelligent decision. There certainly must have been a Caucus on the subject, otherwise they would not have sung their song as well as they have done. I was rather surprised that the honorable member for Fawkner, who is usually a calm and eventempered man, should&#34; have indulged indie language he employed a few moments ago when he suggested that this Government, notwithstanding their great schemes;, were, so to speak, simply &#34; fluking &#34; along. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to know that, even when the honorable member has spoken, the last word of wisdom has not been uttered. I desire, in the first place,, to refer to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, concerning which a great storm was raised last night. A cursory glance at the Estimates should indicate to an intelligent man that the work of providing these mills has just been entered upon - that a certain portion of the buildings is to be erected, and that portion of the machinery is to be installed to enable operations to be commenced as sooa as possible. &#39; It is evident that it is not proposed to refrain from doing any work until the whole building has been erected, and a vast quantity of machinery has been installed. The desireis, I take it, to start in a small way and toadd gradually to the buildings, plant, and machinery. Coming to another question, I would remind honorable members that the development of Australia was due, not so&#62; much to squatting or farming interests as to the discovery of gold, which led to a great influx of population, and gave an impetusto the whole country*. I am one of those who believe that one of the best things that could happen to the Northern Territorywould be fresh discoveries of goldbearingreefs and other mineral deposits in that vast area; and I hope that the Government Geologist, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen,</inline> who is a man of very high standing in his profession, will soon surround himself with a capable staff&#39; of practical miners, and at once set out. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that statement, for, whilst I am inclined to pay very considerable deference to the views of a geologist, I have even greater faith ina practical miner. I believe that when we have a few practical men associated with- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Jensen</inline> we shall make some important discoveries that will be of very great benefit to the Territory. Men are prepared to endure all sorts of hardships, and to travel almost any distance in order to reacb a payable gold-field.  1  have not yet visited the Territory, but hope to have an opportunity to do so before long ; and I certainly believe that we have there areas which, climatically and in other respects, are among the best that we have in Australia. I am inclined to pay considerable attention to the views expressed by the representatives of South Australia in this regard, and to believe that the development of the Territory will be more rapid if we start from the south rather than from the north. I do not suggest that we should neglect the north, but I understand that he proposed extension of the Pine Creek railway to the Katherine will run directly south along what would be the ordinary route to be followed, whether there was any deviation or not. In this regard, however, I am looking to the development of not only the Northern Territory, but Central Australia, and the best way to develop Central Australia, as well as the Territory, is to construct a line as nearly as possible down the centre of the Territory, provided that there are no insuperable engineering difficulties in the way. Such a line would develop not only the Territory, but the eastern portion of Western Australia. I hold the view that, in the far east of Western Australia, there is untold mineral wealth, and a line running through the Territory from north to south, with branch lines running both east and west, would do more to develop Central Australia than any other scheme of which I know. Reference has been made this afternoon by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro to the want of banking facilities in the Federal Territory. The honorable member takes a keen interest in the Territory, and, in passing, I may say that I think that one way of getting over the difficulty in regard to the nonrepresentation of residents of the Federal Territory in this Parliament would be to attach that area to an adjacent constituency. I am satisfied that in that way residents of the Federal Territory would be as well represented as they would be if they had separate representation in this House. As the result of the transfer of the Federal Territory to the Commonwealth, the State Savings Bank, we are informed, is not now carrying oh business there, and cannot renew loans made by it to local land-owners prior to the transfer. We have, therefore, a splendid opportunity to establish there a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. There are a number of workmen in the Federal Capital, and we should afford them every facility to place their savings in safe keeping. We should also give some consideration to local residents w&#39;ho have borrowed money from the State Savings Bank, and who, because of the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth, cannot obtain a renewal of their loans. I wish to impress upon the Minister the importance of the three points to which I have referred, and I trust that he will take them into consideration. </para>

          <para>. - The Government would have done much better than they have if, before making any proposal for expending money in the Northern Territory, they had submitted to the House a complete schedule setting forth a definite policy. I also take the view that they would have acted more in the interests of the Territory had they started the work of development from the south. We have had submitted to u&#163; reports to the effect that there are exceedingly valuable agricultural, pastoral, and mineral areas in the vicinity of the MacDonnell Ranges, and with such reports before us, we could not make a greater mistake than that which we are now committing. The attempt to develop the Territory from the north has been responsible for the failure that has hitherto been experienced. It is the one mistaken policy that has resulted in one of the greatest failures in the history of British settlement. We have there an indebtedness of &#163;3,500 per head of the white residents of the Territory, and that gives us an expenditure of ,&#163;144,000 per annum in .respect of interest. The Government are adding one-third more to this indebtedness, and this, capitalized, brings the indebtedness per head of the white population up to nearly &#163;4,500. The whole history of British settlement cannot show a more disastrous record. </para>

            <para>- No ; but, with the exception of a period of about twelve months, they have sat on the Government side of the House ever since I have been a member. The policy of successive South Australian Governments has ended in disastrous failure, because of the attempt to settle the Territory from the fever, the malarial, and the tick or tropical zone. They have overlooked the fact that rich and valuable land is to be tapped from the south, where we have, comparatively speaking, the temperate zone of Australia. The Territory would derive very much greater advantage from the construction of a line starting from the south, and. working in a northerly direction, than it will do by a continuance of the disastrous policy under which an attempt has been made to settle the Territory from its more tropical northern extremity. I was one of those who opposed the taking over of the Northern Territory from South Australia, because I felt that the Commonwealth was making a very bad bargain; but having assumed responsibility for the Territory, no good puipose will be served by imitating the mistakes of South Australia. We are, however, following the example of that State by continuing the policy which has brought about the present condition of affairs. We have sent to the Northern Territory a large batch of highly-paid officers, but have not attempted to induce one white settler to go there. We are providing a steam hammer for the cracking of nuts. At an expenditure of over &#163;60,000 a year, the Northern Territory is to be governed by officials. </para>

            <para>- But having a population of only 1,000 white persons. The indebtedness of the Northern Territory is  .&#163;3,500  per head of the white population, and to that this . Government has added one-third without increasing the tax-paying population in the least; all those whom it has sent to the Northern Territory are a burden on the taxpayers. Honorable members opposite are as dissatisfied with the way in which these Estimates have been put before us as we are. The honorable member for Hindmarsh knows that the policy of settling the Territory at its northern end is condemned throughout his &#34;own State, but he will do nothing to remedy the disaster brought about by South Australian methods. But instead of dealing fairly and squarely with the position, he played the part of the squid, that unsavoury fish which, when disturbed, ejects an inky fluid, under cover of which it tries to escape. He tried to make out that there is a conspiracy to depart from the arrangement with South Australia in regard to railway construction. The honorable member for Grey knows that I have stated publicly and privately that I consider that the Commonwealth is pledged to construct the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. One of the reasons why. I opposed the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth was that it was accompanied by the condition that the line should be taken from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. Being now bound to construct that line, it would be a common-sense course to commence its construction at the southern end, spending our money on the development of the temperate lands of the Territory, where something like, comparatively speaking, closer settlement may be possible. The leasing of the Territory to squatters will not materially increase its population. For half a century a great part of the land there has been held under pastoral lease ; but the work of the stations is done largely by aboriginals who, although disinclined for ordinary work, make fairly good stockmen. If practically all the Territory were under pastoral lease, its population would not be much increased. But in. the temperate region near the Macdonnell Ranges, there is a hope of settling the country. Before we spend a shilling on railway construction, we should have a full and definite scheme of railway development put before us, and should proceed in accordance with that scheme. Short lines like that from Darwin to Pine Creek will do little for the development of the country. Nothing much is to be expected from continuing that line for a few miles. All that will be done will be to add to the enormous indebtedness of the Territory, and to increase the army of officials who merely help each other to do nothing,, from the geologist to those employed in the steam laundry. The acme of absurdity was reached when a market gardener was sent to teach the Chinamen how to grow cabbages. The debate on these Estimates has been unusually long, but for that Ministers are responsible. Never before has so little information </para>

        <para class="block">Hieen placed before members in regard to Works Estimates. I felt sorry for the Minister of Home Affairs last night, because be could tell us so little. It is the practice of every Parliament for Ministers to inform members fully regarding their works proposals, and not one item should be passed until members have obtained from Ministers :the explanation they require regarding it. In this case, we have had no information as to the purposes for which money is asked, or as to the ultimate cost of works towards which we have been asked to vote money. We have been expected to vote blindfold. If the supporters of the Government were on this side, they would be as eager as we are for information. Why has it been refused? Is it because the departmental officers have not supplied it to Ministers, or because the Jatter wish to bludgeon through their proposals without regard to what we may say, or what the public may think? Our Defence expenditure is likely in the future to prove a mill-stone round our necks. It now -amounts . to .&#163;5,000,000 per annum - a shocking sum to vote without the slightest information. </para>

            <para>- Not much has been done to turn out a fighting force since last year. Our expenditure on Defence per head of population puts us at the head of the list, and the efficiency of our fighting force at the bottom of it. The Defence vote will have to be taken in hand before  very  long by one side of the House or the other. One matter mentioned by the hon orable member for Eden-Monaro requires consideration. Some of the small landholders in the Federal Territory . may be placed in a very awkward position owing . to the fact that they have borrowed money from the New South Wales Savings Bank, which is not permitted to advance money on any lands out of the State. This presents a chance for the Federal Government to establish their Savings Bank in the Federal Territory, and take up the position held by the State Savings Bank prior to the transfer. </para>

            <para>- What i suggest should be done at once, because, as the loans are falling due, the settlers may, as I say, be placed in an exceedingly awkward position. In regard to the Federal Territory, I hope the House will pause before committing itself to any railway extension from the north, but will rather decide to continue the line from the south, where there is, at any rate, a chance of earning some revenue. </para>

          <para>.-! notice that no expenditure is proposed for armament at North Head, Sydney, and Goode Island, although that line remains in the Estimates. Evidently the Government do not intend to spend any money whatever in fortifying North Head, although we know that, according to the military authorities, it is most desirable that it should be fortified. Last year ,&#163;5,000 was voted, and apparently, .&#163;5,000 was spent on the armament of the three places mentioned. </para>

            <para>- If the money is intended to be spent at North Head, the fact should 0 appear in the Estimates. This bears out Itfae contention of honorable members on this side that the Estimates are prepared in such a <inline font-style="italic">\ague</inline> wav as to make it not at all sur  prising  that we do not understand where the&#39;money is to be spent. There were two ne_&#62;y guns placed at Middle Head last year, but these can be of no use if North Head is left unprotected. Lord Kitchener not only expressed the opinion that North Head should be fortified, but wondered why it had not been fortified before. Fortifications at Middle Head, or at any other inside point of the harbor, are futile against a foreign warship, which might lie off the North Head, where there is a lot of dead water that cannot be touched from the South Head, and from which any vessel could shell Sydney. So far as I can see, however, no provision is made this year for the fortification of North Head, for, if any portion of the ,&#163;115,000 was intended to be spent there, the fact would appear in the Estimates. Evidently none of the &#163;5,000 voted last year was spent at Goode Island; and this means,  1  suppose, that the old fort at Thursday Island is to remain. As I pointed out once before, Thursday Island as a fortified position is simply a joke. </para>

            <para>- Thursday Island is not Goode Island ; and it is essential that the fort should be removed from the former place. Recently, when on a visit there,  I  inspected the place, and obtained all the information I could in the limited time at my disposal from the officer in charge ; and  I  discovered that the fort is, to all intents and purposes, useless. The guns are short ranged and obsolete; the projectile which they could throw would not pierce the armour of a modern warship. </para>

            <para>- I should not go so far as to say that, because I think there are some up-to-date guns here, though they may not be of the longest range, or of the heaviest calibre. The ostensible reason for the fort at Thursday Island is to protect a naval base and coaling station, which is supposed to be between Goode Island and Wie-wier Island. It is only a small exT panse of coral-bound water, and the guns at Thursday Island are supposed to protect merchantmen or men-of-war who put in for coal, or for protection. The absurdity of the position is that the fort is dominated by many of the surrounding islands, and that, at the back of those islands, on the further side from the fort, there is deep water and good landing places for both men and guns, the latter of which could be taken on to the hills of theislands, and from there have the fort at their mercy. There are from eighty to one hundred men, with officers, stationed at. Thursday Island; and there is a large expenditure each year on wages, upkeep of barracks, and so forth, although the fort serves no good purpose. It is said that the fort, if removed, should be taken to Goode Island, but of that I do not approve, because the proper place would be Simpson! Bay, which has the mainland for a background, and an excellent harbor, with anisland about 2 miles from the shore, eim% nently suitable for the magazines and stores. In any case, we ought not to have obsolete guns at Thursday Island. As to the Northern Territory, I fail to see much use in constructing the proposed line fromi Pine Creek to Katherine River at the present time. Such a line cannot confer much benefit, even on the people of the NorthernTerritory, for, during my visit, I did not see any evidence of much population in thevicinity of Katherine River. Further, what is going to be done in regard to the necessary alteration of the gauge? </para>

            <para>- There ought to be some mention of the intentions of the Government in regard to the alteration of the gauge- If the gauge is not altered, there will be 150 miles, from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, of a 3-ft. 6-in. line, and 60 or 70 miles, from Pine Creek to Katherine River, of a 4-ft. <inline font-style="italic">%\-\a.</inline> line. Two gauges on this small railway would mean, for one thing, two sets of rolling-stock. It would cost very nearly as much to alter the gauge from Darwin to Pine Creek as to build the railway itself. The present sleepers will be all useless to carry a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, and they are a very expensive item. Alterations will have to be made in the cuttings, in the curves, and in the rolling-stock. </para>

            <para>- It will have to be &#34;over the Katherine,&#34; because I saw none from Darwin to the Katherine, and I saw none at the Katherine. Is the railway ultimately going from the Katherine down to Oodnadatta, in South Australia, or is it to be connected with the Queensland railways? In my opinion, the latter course should be followed. Although I know there is an understanding or contract between the Federal and South Australian Governments that the line shall be continued from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, no time is set down for carrying it out, even if there be a definite contract. To solve the problem of settlement in the Northern Territory, we should without delay connect it with the greatest centre of population in Australia, and that is Sydney. This can be done more expeditiously than to make a connexion with Oodnadatta. The honorable member for Hindmarsh made rather a heated attack on those members who dared to say that the railway should go anywhere else than through South Australia, but I hold that if we wish to encourage settlement in the Territory we should give settlers there an opportunity of reaching the best and biggest market in Australia. Sydney, as the most populous centre, would offer that market. We should construct the railway to connect with the Queensland system. I understand that there is some arrangement between the New South Wales Minister of Works and the Queensland Government to link up the New South Wales and Queensland railway systems. That connexion would go out from Bourke by Hungerford and Tobermory. The Queensland Parliament have already voted ,&#163;6,000,000 to extend their western railway system out to Camooweal. When that line was completed, and the connexion with Bourke made, the Commonwealth Government would have only 640 miles of railway to construct from Pine Creek to Camooweal, instead of over 1,000 miles from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta.. If the line went from Sydney <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bourke, it would go practically through good country all the way, whereas from Oodnadatta a great part of the way would lie through a desert, where the rainfall is only 4J inches in the year. The best part of the country in the Northern Territory is the Barklay tablelands, which are adjacent to the western border of Queensland. I am told that the railway would pass through a magnificent stretch of country there, and I strongly advocate that no time should be lost in endeavouring to link up the Northern Territory with our greatest centre of population by this route. From a defence point of view also, the Territory should be linked up with the most populous centre, because that is where the &#34;most troops will be situated. The greatest number of troops would be available in Sydney, and for that reason alone the route I advocate should be adopted. Had the Nor&#39;.hern Territory been connected with the Queens-&#39; land railway system during the last drought, it would have been of enormous benefit to the people of New South Wales, who could have saved, millions of stcck by sending them up into this country for agistment. If Queensland and the north had been linked up, &#62; the present meat famine in parts of the Commonwealth, particularly in New South Wales, would have been prevented. From Sydney, <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bourke, to Darwin, by the route I have indicated, the distance would be 2,173 miles, as against 2,966 miles if the route <inline font-style="italic">via-</inline> Adelaide were adopted. That would mean a saving of close on 800 miles for the people of Sydney, and, surely, they are worthy of some consideration. The distance from Brisbane to Darwin by rail would be 2,000 miles, as against 3,691 miles <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Adelaide. Passengers by train from Rockhampton could reach Darwin by travelling 1,900 miles, as against 4,000 miles if they had to go round by Adelaide. Passengers from Melbourne to Darwin would have to travel 2,463 miles, as against 2,379 miles <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Adelaide, so that there would be very little difference for them. From Ad&#39;elnide by rail to Darwin, through Sydney, the distance would be 2,947 - miles, instead of  1,896  miles <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Oodnadatta. The greatest number of people will be served by taking the railway to Sydney instead of to Adelaide. The census returns show the population of New South Wales and Queensland to be  2,252,000,  as against a population of  1,724,000  for Victoria and South Ausr tralia, and it is this smaller number who would have a shorter distance to travel if the route were <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Adelaide. From the point of view, therefore, of the greatest good to the greatest number, there can be no doubt that the line from Sydney to Bourke <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Camooweal to Darwin should receive the earnest consideration of the Government. There is, of course, the problem of the gauges, but that is for the Government to solve. If they are not able to solve it, they will have to make room for some one who can. We have a  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge in Queensland. I asked the Railways Commissioner in Brisbane, some time ago, when Queensland was going to fall into line with the rest of the Commonwealth by altering its gauge from  3  ft.  6  in. to  4  ft.  81  in. He laughed, and said he had. not the slightest intention of altering it, adding, &#34; It will cost us  &#163;27,000,000  to alter the whole of our gauge.&#34;  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> - Was it <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Evans</inline> who said that? </para>

            <para>- -It is what he told me. He said, as we know, that it would cost far more to convert a  3-ft. 6-in.  line to n  4-ft.  81-in. gauge, than it would to alter a wide to a narrow gauge. He pointed out that a great many of the curves would have to be altered if the Queensland railway gauge were raised to  4  ft.  8J  in. - that tunnels, platforms, and rolling-stock would also have to be altered - and he  sp:&#60;1  distinctly that the cost would be that which I have stated. The problem is very dif ficult of solution; and I wish to ascertain whether the Government are doing anything to solve it? Are they communicating with Queensland? The difficulty must be accentuated as time goes on, for new lines are being constructed in New South Wales and Queensland every year. </para>

            <para>- But if the North-western line in New South Wales is eventually connected with the western railways of Queensland, we shall immediately have a break of gauge. We should have another break of gauge if the Pine Creek line were linked up with the Queensland system at Camooweal ; so that between Sydney and Port Darwin there, would be two breaks of gauge. The Government ought to endeavour to grapple with the question of uniformity of gauge. If Queensland is going every year to construct mile after mile of railway on a  3-ft. 6-in.  gauge, we shall never be able to look forward to a solution of the question. I understand that conferences .have taken place, but that nothing definite has-been arrived at. Surely some steps should be taken to bring about conferences of the States in order that finality may be reached. I have no desire to labour the question ; but to survey a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is to start in the wrong direction. A complete and comprehensive scheme of railway construction in the Northern Territory should be mapped out for us. We should then be able to determine where a start should be made, or we could leave it to experts to guide us in the matter. It seems to mc that this bit of a railway line is to be planked down, so to. speak, in the dark. The Government have no idea whether it is going to be carried on. or what is to be done in regard to the question of break of gauge. In short, these Estimates have been submitted to us on such vague information that it is difficult to know where we stand. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Ministry, before coming to a decision with regard to the question of gauge, will get from experts a report as to what  ought to be the standard gauge for Australia. They ought not to assume that the decision to construct the transcontinental railway on a 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge was a direction from Parliament that the Commonwealth Government, in agreement with the States, should make the standard gauge for Australia 4 ft. 8J in. I have no desire to repeat what I said when this question was discussed last year; but, having heard the honorable member for Parkes say that the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, in opinion as well as in fact, I suppose, is the gauge of the world, I feel it necessary to call attention to the last report on the subject of gauges. I refer to the report of the Irish Railway Commission, which sat in 1909. That very important Commission was appointed to consider the monopoly of private companies of transit, and to what extent it interfered with legitimate development. The English engineers who gave evidence then, as well as the Irish engineers, concurred in the statement that 5 ft. 3 in. was the best of all gauges. It was said that if the gauge of the railways in England could be changed from 4 ft. in. to s ft. 3 in., the alteration would be made ; but that they were faced with the fact that a tremendous bill would be consequential upon it. In America, where there are nearly 300,000 miles of railway lines, there is a very large mileage on a 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge running through forty-six or fortyseven States, and passing through some territories which practically rendered it impossible to act on the opinion of modern engineers that the wider gauge is the better from the stand-point of economy, as well as in other respects. I hope that we shall obtain some expert advice upon this matter, and not rest content with the advice of one or two engineers. I should be sorry in any way to impugn either the ability or the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of any of the experts that have reported in connexion with the Western Australian transcontir  fal railway ; but it would be a very grea. help to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> himself to have the deliberate opinion of a conference, on which the Commonwealth as well as the States could be represented, called for the .&#171;r&#187;ecial purpose of considering what should 1 &#39;ihe standard gauge for Australia. The meeting of engineers, to which reference was made when this question was discussed If&#39; vear, was not called to give an opinio&#39; in  respect of the gauge to be adoptc&#39;. They referred incidentally in their report to the advisableness of adopting a 4-ft. 8L-in. gauge ; but I have reason to think some of. them would not indorse that view if they were called upon now to express a deliberate opinion. It is a mistake, without having the guidance of experts, to introduce another gauge in connexion with the Northern Territory. There is already a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line there, and some say that it should be continued on the same gauge with a view to linking it up with the railway system of Queensland. If the Government do decide to adopt the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge, I hope they will follow the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> when Commissioner of New South Wales, that all rollingstock ordered should be capable, if necessary, of accommodation to the wider gauge. He recommended many years ago that a conference should be held to determine the standard gauge for Australia. </para>

            <para>- A very good idea. I went specially from South Australia -in 1888 to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy.</inline> The South Australian House of Assembly, of which I was a member, had carried a motion submitted by me that a meeting of the Railways Commissioners of the States should be held to decide what ought to be the standard gauge for Australia, and I went to Victoria and New South Wales to ascertain wnat chance there was of that motion being acted upon. It was owing to the opposition of Victoria that action was not then taken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> was then, I think, Commissioner for this State. At all events, Victoria did not acquiesce in the suggestion, and the result was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy&#39;s</inline> anticipation of a uniform gauge being adopted in about ten years&#39; time was not realized. There was no concert as to what should be the standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy</inline> pointed out that if a standard gauge were decided upon, allfuture rolling-stock could be so made that it could be used on the wider gauge lines. I ask the Government to see that the rolling-stock which they order for use on the Northern Territory railwavs is also capable of being used on a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge. There is no reason for the Government to believe that, because the House decided that the transcontinental railway should be built on a  4-ft.  gauge, the line across the continent to Port Darwin should not be built on a  5-ft. 3-in.  gauge. The South Australian Government would probably be inclined to continue its  5-ft. 3-in.  line to Port Augusta, and if the Commonwealth Government widened the  3-ft.  6-in. line to Oodnadatta, and eventually constructed - as they must, according to the moral, and what seems to be the legal, obligation - the line to Port Darwin on the same gauge, we should have one grand trunk line on a uniform gauge running from Albury right up to that port. There is nothing to prevent lines from Queensland and New South Wales being connected with that line either on their present gauge, as feeders, or upon what ultimately may be the standard gauge of Australia. I am asking, not that we should decide to adopt the  5-ft. 3-in.  gauge, but that the Government should have a special inquiry on the subject. I urge that they should not act upon a merely incidental reference to the question of gauge on the part of a Committee that was not appointed to deal specially with that question. A deliberate decision should be given in the light of expert advice. </para>

It was never said that because the Government were adopting the  4-ft.  S^-in. gauge for the Western Australian railway, therefore that gauge, without the guidance of a special conference, should be accepted as the standard for all Australia.

            <para>- There was no meeting at which any evidence was taken, or any deliberate and final expression of opinion given, in favour of a  4-ft. 8J-in.  gauge. I know from experts in South&#39; Australia, whose names I shall not mention, that if some of them were asked for their deliberate opinion, they would recommend a  5-ft. 3-in.,  and not a  4-ft. 8J-in.,  gauge. Since  1903,  the opinion of experts has been in favour of the  5-ft. 3-in.  gauge. </para>

            <para>- There has been no recommendation following upon a proper investigation by experts. However, I shall not discuss the matter now, because finality cannot be reached at this stage; but I ask the Minister to follow the suggestion of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eddy,</inline> one. of the most competent railway men, from what I have heard and read, whom we have had in Australia, and have the rolling-stock of the Northern Territory constructed so that it may be accommodated, if necessary, to another gauge, or have an inquiry in advance made as to the gauge which should be adopted for all Commonwealth railways. That should not take more than a month or two. It is not to be expected that the transcontinental line through South Australia should be delayed to enable a connexion with Camooweal to be made. The transcontinental line was recommended for defence purposes by Major-General Edwards many years ago, and Lord Kitchener recommended it for the same reason, and also, I think, to promote development. </para>

          <para>.- The question of gauge is of great importance to the Commonwealth, because in the near future we shall be constructing more than one long length of line ; and if there is to be the conference suggested by the honorable member for Angas, it should be held very soon for its recommendations to be of any practical value. If the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line is constructed on the 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge, all the other Commonwealth lines will have to be on the same gauge. I do not offer an opinion as to whether the 4-ft. 8j-in. or the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge is the better ; I &#39;agree with the honorable member for Angas that we should endeavour to choose the best gauge, because, in years to come, that will mean economy in working expenses. I wish to know something about the proposal to construct a Une to the Katherine River. For the development of the Territory, the first thing to be done is the construction of a transcontinental line through South Australia. I was opposed to the agreement which was made with South Australia, because of the condition regarding railway construction, which, I thought, bound the Commonwealth too strictly ; but, having made that agreement, we must keep our bargain. Railway connexion with the Queensland system may be a good thing ; but we have agreed to construct the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. South Australia has had the best of the deal, and has made an agreement whose terms are not fair from the Federal stand-point, as the rights of the other States are not considered. I favoured the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, though I objected to the terms of the agreement; but that agreement must be kept. We were told that there are about 80,000,000 acres of good wheat land just beyond the Macdonnell Ranges. If that is&#39; so, we should push the line north from Oodnadatta. It is useless for people to try to grow wheat without means of transport to market; but if there is this area of suitable wheat land, we should provide a means of communication by extending the Oodnadatta line, which, at present, does not pay, to that district. </para>

            <para>- I have waited for some days for Ministers to explain these proposals for the expenditure of &#163;4,000,000, but have heard nothing from them. Is the Katherine River line to form part of the connexion between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta; and on what gauge is it to be constructed ? We, on this side, cannot learn anything from Ministers, and receive but scant courtesy from them. If the Prime Minister thinks that he can quieten the Opposition with threats, he is mistaken. I protest against the way in which the people living in the Federal Capital area are being treated in regard to land matters. About nine months ago I attended a deputation which waited on the Minister, but I have to learn that those who put their grievance before him have yet been properly settled with. They have another grievance. The Savings Bank of New South Wales, under the Act, is not permitted to lend money out of the State; and the settlers will be placed in an_ awkward position if they cannot renew their loans. In our great prosperity, for which our friends opposite take all the credit, the price of money is rising fast, and mortgagors are in for a bad time in the near future. When in Collins-street the other day I saw that a building society was offering 5 per cent, on deposits for two years, and I wondered what interest the borrowers from the society would be called upon to pay. Settlers in the Federal area will not be able to renew their loans on anything like the original favorable terms; and, therefore, the Commonwealth Government should come to their assistance, and see that they are not penalized. Their present position is not due to any fault of their own. They have not been paid for their land, although the Prime Minister last ,year borrowed &#163;2,000,000, of which ,&#163;600,000 was to be used for that purpose. </para>

            <para>- As to the proposed railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River, I hope the Government will exercise due care, because we are starting our works in this part of Australia, and a false step may lead to endless trouble and expense. There is a tremendous responsibility cast on the Minister in charge of this Territory, and I hope that he and the officials of his Department will exercise wise caution. The Commonwealth will, of course, be f orced to experiment ; and if we do not hit on the right procedure at first, we must take the consequences. For some time, we shall derive comparatively no revenue from the Territory, and unless we induce settlement of the right sort, it will be long before any revenue to speak of comes to hand. At present, we have to provide large sums every year; and if we are not exceedingly careful in the public interest, we shall not only lose a lot, but the Territory will be set back for a considerable period. Should this occur, the taxpayers of the southern parts will be disheartened, and Australia will receive such a bad advertisement that many intending settlers will change their minds. I hope, however, that this is not to be our fate, but that we shall see some real progress in this undefended part of the country. The proper way to tackle this railway problem is to go boldly forward from the south, and thus carry out our agreement with South&#39; Australia. I am not at all satisfied with the way in which the Government have treated the House. We have before us the largest works schedule, representing some  &#163;4,000,000, eveT  presented to this Parliament ; and Ministers ought to come here fully primed and prepared with all the necessary information. Indeed, seeing that a number of these items are new, Ministers ought not to wait to be asked Questions, but should at once inform the House of the policy which they intend to pursue. Several of these items represent a policy in them selves; and on such an occasion as this, it is not for members to probeand ask questions, but for Ministers to take the House into their confidence. The fact is, however, that Ministers will not even answer questions ; and when we asked for certain reports that are in one of the De-, partments, we we&#39;re met with a point-blank refusal. We are asked to vote  &#163;200,000-  for some naval expenditure, and when we endeavour to obtain a little information as to what the item means, not a syllable canwe get from the responsible Minister. Then,, again, there is an item of  &#163;80,000  for mobilization, stores, drill halls, and so forth ; and in regard to this no information is forthcoming. </para>

            <para>- I was not in the House during the whole of last night, and I may be wrong. I know that the Minister would not intentionally give incorrect information ; and my complaint is that we cannot get any information at all on matters of importance. For instance, there is tne item of  &#163;45.000  for the Military College, and when we ask for some particulars, the Minister simply tosses his head and says nothing. No information has been vouchsafed while I have been in thechamber, and I have been here as long as. any other member during the last two days.. Even if information has been given on some of the items to which I have just referred, that does not detract very much from the charge I have levelled against the Government, because I can pick out many another item of almost equal importance, and no ihonorable member opposite can say that the Government have given us any information about these. The charge as a whole, therefore, is well substantiated. When the Government ask the House to vote so much money as is involved in .these Estimates, they should be prepared to give more inforimation than they have afforded us during the last few days. As a rule these Estimates go through fairly quickly, and they would have been passed long ago on this occasion if the Ministry had come here prepared to answer  questions, or had made ;an intelligent statement to the House. If they think they are going to bludgeon the Opposition into silence, they are making a huge mistake. We have not been treated even with the courtesy which we might have expected as representatives of the people trying to obtain a little information on matters of great public importance. </para>

            <para>- Nobody expects the honorable member to know or care much about these things. The honorable member may think he does his duty by making interjections of that kind, but that does not relieve me of the responsibility to do my duty by watching public expenditure, and trying to save the taxpayer from being unduly burdened. The fact that the taxpayer is the last person to be considered by the honorable member for East Sydney makes it all the more necessary that some others of us should protect the taxpayers of his district, and it does not alter the fact that matters of public policy relating to works construction, and involving the expenditure of millions of pounds, constitute some of the most important work upon which this House can possibly be engaged. When honorable members opposite attempt to charge us with wasting time because we closely criticise the public expenditure, and ask to be informed on various points in relation to it, they utterly misconceive the purpose for which Parliament exists. I can conceive of no more justifiable use of the time of Parliament than in a careful examination of proposals for expenditure such as we have before us in these Works Estimates. It is no light matter to call upon a population of just under four and a half millions of people to contribute such an enormous load of taxation as will necessarily be involved in the commitments ahead of us. We should, therefore, be absolutely failing in our duty as a Parliament if, when any Government1 brought down proposals for expenditure, we did not seek to be properly informed in regard to all the items before we voted for the spending of money which must come out of the pockets of the handful of people on this continent. </para>

There are proposals here involving in many cases hundreds of thousands of pounds, and we cannot get the slightest information from any Minister regarding their&#39; details.

The Minister of Home Affairs has just given us some information in regard to those mills, and the honorable member for Wilmot asserted a few minutes ago that erroneous details have been given by the Minister concerning the actual expenditure on some ot the items relating to them. This is one of the items concerning which we desire further information. In the Estimates we have an item of &#163;8,000 in respect of &#34; Woollen Mills,&#34; but on reference to a paper dealing with those works, I find that &#163;8,000 does not represent anything like the cost of the building. </para>

He occupied about a minute and a half in doing so, and the honorable member is now trying to debate in detail the question then raised. I shall allow him the fullest possible latitude to deal with the question in a general way, but he must not refer to it in detail. </para>

            <para>- I have a statement which shows that some of the information that has been given to the House is not accurate, and that the total amount set out in the Estimates in respect of certain works does not represent anything like the amount actually to be expended. That statement will apply, not only to one, but to several cases. It has been the practice with other Governments to submit for the guidance of honorable members, in connexion with the Estimates, a general statement covering the proposals embodied in them. That practice has not been followed by the present Ministry, and one complaint is that we are left entirely in the dark as to the nature of a lot of the expenditure involved in the proposals put before us. In the most courteous way we have asked Ministers for information about matters of expenditure, and questions of policy underlying that expenditure, but, in most cases, it has not been forthcoming, while in others the particulars given have been of the most meagre and unsatisfactory description. In more than one instance, the information has been misleading. I do not say that Ministers have intentionally sought to mislead the House, but the few disjointed scraps of information given by them in. some instances have been misleading, and misleading probably because they have not had the details to set before us. They do not seem to have come here primed with the information necessary to enable honorable members to know what they are doing. We are placed in a most singular and peculiar position. I have never heard of another Parliament being so situated. A request for information by members of the Opposition is regarded as a gross impertinence, and as something that must be resented and punished. When the Prime Minister was leaving the Chamber just before the adjournment for dinner, he made the covert threat that he would keep us here all night. Why ? Merely because we are asking for information. Surely that is not the way that we as an Opposition should be treated when we are considering important proposals to expend public money. From a remark made by the Minister of External Affairs, I gathered that out of a lump sum appearing in the Estimates, provision is to be made for expenditure on fortificatioris at Thursday Island, although that fact is not shown in the Estimates themselves. While at Thursday Island recently, I saw the fortifications, and also heard the opinions of local residents, military, nautical,, and otherwise. I believe that military experts who have been up there do not agree that Thursday Island is a fit site for fortifications, and that, as a matter of fact, a vessel from the east desiring to land troops in Australia need not go near Thursday Island. </para>

            <para>- I think Admiral Henderson, amongst others, has pointed out that there are better strategic positions. About Thursday Island is a cluster of closely-grouped islands separated only by two or three miles of water, and some of these being of greater elevation afford opportunities for the landing of troops and guns which could command the forts on Thursday Island. </para>

            <para>- No .; according to several naval and military authorities, that is quite an erroneous idea. As a matter of fact, vessels coming from the east, and desiring to land troops on the mainland, could easily keep out of range of any guns that might be placed on Thursday&#39; Island- If that be so, there ought to be some further investigation to determine whether there is not a more suitable place in the north for fortifications. It has been said that Simpson Bay is far more valuable from a strategical point of view, but since the honorable member for North Sydney, who is a military expert, has more fully pointed out the weakness to which I have referred, I shall not make further allusion to it. Every one who has been to the Northern Territory is aware that the railway line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek is built on a very narrow gauge. It is now proposed to extend that line on a 4-ft. 8j-in. gauge to the Katherine River, and this break of gauge is going to be a very serious matter. My recollection is that steel sleepers are used on the Pine Creek line, and if they are not wide enough to carry a 4-ft. 8j-in. line, new sleepers will have to be provided for the whole length of railway from Pine Creek to Port Darwin. The existing line has cost upwards of &#163;1,000,000, and if it is to be made practically useless by an extension on a broader gauge,, we should pause before we commit the country to the proposed expenditure. We ought to have something in the nature of a railway policy for the Northern Territory before any expenditure on railway construction there is sanctioned. As it is, we are working in the dark. The Government have adopted a most slipshod, method of doing business in this regard. A lot of schoolboys could not be more unbusinesslike. Imagine a public company saying, through its directors, at the annual meeting of shareholders, &#34; We want money to carry out certain works. What those works are going to be, or what they are going to cost, we do not propose to tell you. All that we shall tell you is that we intend to go on with those works, although we have not even an estimate of what they will cost.&#34; A body of shareholders would make very short work of a board of directors that put such a proposition before, them. That, however, is our position. We are supposed to be practically occupying the position of a board of directors watching expenditure on behalf of .the public. Yet when we ask Ministers to give us some reliable information regarding the huge sums which it is proposed to expend, we are treated as if we were making a most unreasonable request. I have not heard of such proceedings in any other Parliament, and they are not likely to increase the respect felt for this body. Had I followed my own inclinations, I should not have spoken on this question; but what would our constituents say if we remained silent, and when asked, &#34; Why did you vote for certain proposals?&#34; could only reply, &#34; We did so, because we were asked to do so. We tried to ascertain why the money was needed, but, when told that that was not our concern, we did not pursue the matter further.&#34; Under such circumstances, would not our constituents be justified in saying that we had not done our duty, aijd that they would send other representatives here? 1 do not know what answer the supporters of the Government will give when their constituents ask them what this money is to be expended foi, and whether the country will get value for the expenditure. All their time will be taken up in explaining. Their present attitude may have this satisfactory result : that the next Parliament may be composed of men who will study more carefully the interests of their constituents, and see that the load of taxation is reduced. It is the policy of the Labour party to pay for works out of current revenue. Therefore, the proposals now under consideration will have to be paid for with money taken from the pockets of the people, the great majority of whom are wage-earners only. It is not the wealthy who suffer for our extravagance ; it is those who earn merely bread and butter, and find it hard to get the butter. The burden of taxation on them is heavy enough already. I hope that Ministers will recede from their truculent attitude, and recognise that the members of the Opposition represent many thousands of electors, and, in asking for information, are prompted, not by individual curiosity, but by the desire to study the interests of their constituents. In my electorate alone there are something like 50,000 voters. Have they not a right to know why the expenditure of the country is increasing? And to whom should they come for information but to me, their representative in Parliament? I can get this information only from Ministers, whose duty it is to give it without even being asked. Ministers should have statements accompanying their Estimates, and should be prepared to at once give the fullest explanation of every item. I hope that before the debate is concluded we shall have further information in regard to a number of the matters to which reference has been made. </para>

          <para>.- I was astounded when the Minister of External Affairs to-day gave certain answers to&#39; questions which I had put on the noticepaper. Two sessions ago we were distinctly promised by the Postmaster-General of the day that official post-offices would be established wherever the postal revenue of a place was ,&#163;200, and that the rule would not be altered by the introduction of penny postage. Now I am informed that official post-offices will not be established, except in places where the postal revenue is ,&#163;300 a year, and there is a revenue of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> a year from telegrams. If that rule is going to be adhered to, I hope that an early opportunity will be given to honorable members to express their views in regard to it. It appears to me that the new rule has been introduced by the Department without sufficient consideration by the Minister, the promise to which I allude being overlooked for the time. I hope that that may be so, and that, on representations being made to the Minister, the promise will be acknowledged, and official post-offices granted on the original terms. I shall not occupy much time in discussing the question before the House. My great objection to the course that has been taken in regard to these Estimates is .that no definite scheme has been laid down by the Government in regard to large proposals for expenditure, and that we have not been told either how much we are committed to, or how Ministers propose to finance their undertakings. Although only small amounts are covered by certain items, they really commit the country to the expenditure of millions ; and I maintain that it will be impossible to meet these commitments out of revenue, or, at least, out of the present revenue. When the Budget is under discussion, I think it will be shown that our revenue is likely to decrease later. We ought to know how Ministers propose to find the money for the undertakings of which we approve. If additional taxation is to be proposed, let Ministers say so; while, if Loan Funds are to be resorted, to, the public should know. Befors consenting to initial expenditure, we should have definite statements as to what is proposed and what the ultimate cost will be, and should be informed how it is intended to raise the necessary funds.  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEAKIN</inline> (Ballarat) &#91;8.36&#93;.- Honorable memkirs have been, in a measure, at cross purposes, the difficulty that has arisen being due to misunderstandings on both sides which, I hope, may shortly be removed. Ev. 1 the Ministerial supporters will not dispute the doctrine that the representatives of the nation are entitled to the fullest information regarding every proposal for expenditure. Yet, when the proposed appropriations are larger than ever before, there has been more difficulty in obtaining explanations of items regarding which information has been sought than on any previous occasion. </para>

            <para>- The reverse is not suggested. During the discussion of these Estimates, which has extended over several days, the attendance has varied greatly, and important questions have sometimes been discussed by a very thin House. A preliminary misunderstanding arose regarding the charges about the manner in which the making of tunnels and trenches for the Post Office Department has been conducted. It is impossible to understand the- reason why the Government decline to give the reports of responsible inspectors who have signed the reports and made themselves responsible for them - reports, only selections from which have been placed before the House. In a somewhat long experience, I cannot remember any previous occasion when information of this kind - absolutely innocuous so far as I can see, and which every honorable member, standing alone, is entitled to demand on behalf of his constituency and the public generally - has been refused. These reports clearly ought to be in the possession, and the property of, the House if it so desires. I trust that, on further consideration, these &#39; obstacles which have caused a great deal of heartburning will be removed. </para>

            <para>- I call attention to these matters because there have been inflammatory results, owing to the refusals on the part of the Government, when requests for information have been pressed and urged. This has created a suspicion that there is an organized policy of refusing to this Opposition information which, in our experience, has never before been refused. Of course, the Government can remove these apprehensions. The Government have that in their power, and I hope they will supply the facts in the case alluded to, and in other special instances to which attention has been invited during the debate, but, so far, without success. </para>

        <para>For instance, on page  227,  a vote of.  &#163;80,000  is proposed for the acquisition of sites for the erection of mobilization stores, drill halls, and so forth. The information asked for by honorable members has been of a most general kind - as to the manner in which the particular item is made up - where the sites are, whether there are any special sites, and the general purpose and outline of the vote. More than this honorable members do not ask. Their requests are for such a reasonable understanding of the vote as will enable them to face their constituents at the coming election or at any meetings. </para>

            <para>- I advise the honorable member not to ask. The point is that some honorable members have not been in attendance at the whole of the sittings. Consequently, in regard to particular items, it is possible that explanations have been made at one stage which have not been repeated when asked for at another ; in this way the difficulty has arisen. </para>

            <para>- It is not necessary to multiply differences of opinion on the matter ; it is possible that both honorable members may be correct. The Honorary Minister considers that he has given sufficient information, while my colleagues consider the information insufficient and unsatisfactory. I am certain that if all honorable members had been present at the same time, the common sense of the House would have found a practical method of settling their differences, which are of no magnitude, without any unnecessary friction. </para>

        <para>On the next page is another item on which general information should be given, and with more particulars than in the previous case ;  1  allude to the establishment of the Military College. According to the Estimates we voted for this purpose last year&#62; .&#163;40,000, but ,&#163;68,000 appears to have been spent. Judging by the position of the item on the Estimates, the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;28,000</inline> appears to have been spent without authority, and we are now asked to spend &#163;&#91;45,000 more. It is perfectly fair, I think, to ask how that extra &#163;28,000 was spent last year, and how it is proposed to spend the ,&#163;45,000 this year? </para>

            <para>- It may be stated that part of* the information has, at some time., been given to some honorable members ; but to the Committee as a whole the information has not been imparted. On page 241, it is proposed fo vote no less a sum than &#163;&#91;300,000 for the purchase of warlike stores. These figures are in excess of anything we have been accustomed to in the past. Foi myself, I believe this expenditure to be necessary1 and essential. </para>

            <para>- There, again, the Honorary Minister misunderstands. I mean that it is only within the last two or three years that we have been able to spend such sums. Prior to that it was impossible. We are not only justified by the circumstances of the situation - in the new departures - we are making in military and other matters - but. we are equally entitled to make just as close a scrutiny as ever before of all these items. </para>

In the meantime; however, this item is the signal of a possible commitment of the House. A policy of some kind ought to be laid before us.

This small vote is the first step in a great railway policy for the Commonwealth - a great developmental policy. It is intimately associated with the fortunes of the Territory, and it relates to railway problems that will affect every State of the Commonwealth except Tasmania. Under the circumstances, the general outline which the Minister of External Affairs is prepared to give is absolutely necessary to anything like a clear understanding of the great problem about to be launched. </para>

            <para>- It would be somewhat autocratic if the Minister, who is going to spend the money, were left to himself, as against the rest of the House, to decide when sufficient information had been given, as to how it was to be spent. On that point, the House should exercise its own judgment. Although the Estimates bristle with, contentious topics, and must necessarily be regarded from different points of view, I fail to see that any real difficulty would have arisen, if honorable members had been met with even elementary straightforward explanations of the particular purposes of the votes, and a general indication of the Government&#39;s intentions. We should have been saved many hours of fruitless discussion ; since it is evi dent that there have been occasional duplications of information, and that many honorable members have been unfortunate enough to miss some of it. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members in the Government corner do not seem to realize that, while it is quite legitimate for them to place implicit confidence in the Ministers, there is no such obligation upon honorable members on this side. On the contrary, this side of the House exists to criticise, where, perhaps, honorable members opposite do not desire criticism, or may be satisfied with the information given by the Government. The attitude of the Opposition is either that of hostility to, or acceptance of, these proposals for expenditure, but they cannot be expected to support any proposal until they have had an opportunity of informing their minds by a knowledge of the facts. It is claimed by the Opposition that in all the instances mentioned - which are given after consultation with half-a-dozen honorable &#39; members on this side - the Opposition have reached dead-ends ; that they have not obtained the explanation which is their due, and which it is in the interests of Ministers to give. </para>

        <para>I have called attention to these matters in the hope that, in a practical and business-like manner, we shall be able to dispose of them, having, as far as we could, registered any necessary dissents upon the great and important issues of policy as here embodied. We cannot afford to treat lightly the Bill which will be founded on these resolutions, or to pass by the questions involved in it as being of little moment. They are not to be decided for us on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of members on the other side. On the contrary, these expenditures touch a large number of most fundamental questions affecting and interesting the people of the Commonwealth, who are entitled to be fully informed on them. They cannot be fully informed unless we have an opportunity in this House of utilizing the sources of information in the possession of Ministers, and, perhaps, of some of their supporters, but which are denied to us, except so far as they are now laid on the table of the House. It is our duty to bring into the full and searching light of day every questionable expenditure that we notice on the Estimates, and to point out the relation of questions of policy to matters, of expenditure. It is, therefore, in the discharge of one of the most grave and serious of our obligations as members pf Parliament that we ask for fuller and clearer information than has been accorded to us, with the assurance that, this information being supplied, we shall be found as active as the Government in pushing this measure through its various stages. </para>

            <para>- Is the honorable member in any doubt as to what it is ? Honorable members opposite always want to know something that is not there. This item states as distinctly and clearly as the English language can put it, what it is, but the Opposition say, &#34;That is not it; what does it mean?&#34; We are not here to make any such explanation. The item is for  a  survey. The Bill will come along later, and it is advisable that there should be a Bill. Honorable members who have been in public life for any length of time know that more money has been wasted in Australia through the want of proper surveys than in any other way. Every precaution should, therefore, be taken to see that correct surveys are made of railways, docks, and other works before any money is practically thrown away. </para>

            <para>- Does the honorable member want all the information on this item, or does he want me to deal with the items noted by the Leader of the Opposition? Apparently the Opposition object because something is not there which they would like to have there. The English language conveys clearly that this money is for the cost of a survey, and it is the policy of the Government to make a survey between the two points indicated. If the honorable member wants to know what the item means, it means a survey between those two points to begin with. The next item referred to was the sum of  &#163;200,000  for &#34; naval works.&#34; This deals with Western-, port in Victoria, Port Stephens in New South Wales, Cockburn Sound in Western Australia, and, I think, incidentally with the Williamstown dep6t. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is necessary, as they are part of the defence scheme. It is for the honorable member and others in Opposition to say whether this is an urgent, matter or not. If it had been less urgent, I venture to say it would have been easier to give fuller details. Honorable members opposite have been charging the Government with retarding progress in defence matters, and not showing the expedition we ought to have shown ; but now, when we anticipate in every possible way in order to provide for the defence of Australia, it is suggested that we are concealing something, and not giving sufficient information. </para>

            <para>- I should not be sorry if there was, but I do not think there is. However, no prejudices on my part, or on the part of the Government, will withhold from any part of Australia the necessary money to make its defence effective. Another item referred to was that of  _&#163;45,ooo  towards the cost of establishing a Military College for Australia. Last year, there was a vote of  &#163;40,000,  and &#39; we spent  &#163;68,454.  Was not that a laudable action on the part of the Government, who discovered that the revenue was available, and were able by means of the Treasurer&#39;s advance to provide an additional amount for constructing the Military College? </para>

            <para>- I think the total amount is provided for this year, or nearly so. We pjovided last  year  as much as we thought we could economically spend. I  am  advised by the officers that the increased cost of material and work was the cause of the chief part of the increase. Honorable members are aware that during last year the cost of material increased greatly,- and no sensible representative of the people would stand by and say that, because the cost of labour and material increased, we should not go as far as we could if money could be provided. Practically the same amount of work has been done by the extra amount of money that was provided. Surely that is a fair policy to carry. out? </para>

            <para>- I shall not depart, sir, from your direction. It will be sufficient for me to say that the amount to which reference has been made has been placed on the &#39;Estimates for purposes of utility, and to promote the efficiency of the Citizen Defence Forces. Military areas have been prescribed all over Australia, and halls and other necessary equipment will be required for the increased Citizen Forces. This item, as I have said, does not particularly affect the Cadet Forces; but it must not be forgotten that our Citizen Forces have practically been doubled. We had formerly about 20,000 men in our Citizen Forces, whereas we have now about 40,000, and this vote of &#163;&#91;80,000 will provide hall accommodation and . equipment necessary for mobilization throughout Australia. I regret that, owing to our anxiety to push on with the work of making efficient the Citizen Forces of Australia, we are not yet able to give as full details as I should like to be able to give in regard to this item; but it is well to remember that military areas have been prescribed all over Australia, and that I pledge the Government to expend this money in the particular centres where the greatest efficiency will be secured from its outlay. </para>

We are spending this year something like five and a half millions of money on our defence system, and we must trust the Department to expend a few thousand pounds where it is thought that the greatest efficiency will be secured in respect of the amount that is available for the purpose. </para>

            <para>- I take the responsibility for the course we are now pursuing. We mean to make the defence system efficient, and to secure that efficiency it may. be necessary to have drill halls in some parts of Australia and not in other parts. It would be paltry in the extreme for the representatives of one State to say that they objected to the vote because they thought that the greater proportion might be expended in another State. </para>

            <para>- I do not understand the honorable member, but I am not blind to what I see. I am not blind to the tactics that are being pursued, but I am neither embarrassed nor intimidated. We intend to carry out our programme, and at the same time we shall give to the country all the information that we can. The Treasury is open to any and every member. No one knows that better than does the right honorable member for Swan, and when the details at. the Treasury can be shown - as they have been shown by us in a way unknown in any other Parliament - to members of the Opposition^ the interests of the country cannot go very far astray. In the opening part of his speech, the Leader of the Opposition sought to .make much of a little incident in regard to the alleged inefficiency of workmen employed by the Government, and the demand that as soon as a suggestion of inefficiency or loafing ori the part of Government employes is made - as soon as it is suggested that men are not giving the Government an equivalent in labour for the pay they receive - we ought to have an inquiry, and present all the reports to Parliament. Parliament would cease to be a deliberative and representative body if that course were followed. The Postmaster-General being, sick and unable, unfortunately, to attend to his departmental duties, I brought down a categorical denial of the statements in question, together with a covering letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright,</inline> the  Deputy  Postmaster-General.. These are either official or they are not. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright</inline> as  Deputy  Postmaster-General&#39; is as much responsible for the working of his Department as is the Minister, and in my opinion that which I produced was an effective answer to the question raised. The Leader of the Opposition has had a long parliamentary experience, mostly as a Minister, but I venture to say that he was never a member of a Government to which the whole press of Australia displayed its teeth as it has done in our case. We have no chance of defending ourselves. </para>

          <para>.- I had no intention of interposing in this debate, and 1 rise now only to pour a little oil on the troubled waters. I was astounded at the speech to which we have just listened. One might have thought that the Prime Minister was suffering under a sense of personal injustice, but all that the Opposition have wanted, and all that they desire is the information that on all prev&#39;ous occasions has been readily afforded by Ministers when asking for Supply in respect of matters of this kind. We have asked for no more, and we are entitled to no less. The Treasurer appeared to think that because it became necessary for us to ask how certain amounts fitted in with general schemes concerning Australian defence, we were in some vague and indefinite way insulting him, so far as his capacity to reply is concerned. I would no more dream of indicting the right honorable member&#39;s power? of exposition than I should dream of affronting that delectable sense of humour with which he so often delights the House. I wish to say to him, however, that we have never yet had from this Government any general statement as to how far they are committing themselves in matters of naval defence to which some of these items relate. Take, for instance, the vote for naval works. The Prime Minister thinks - he is not quite sure, and does not think it quite fair to ask him to be quite sure - that the vote has something to do with the construction of new naval bases about the coastline of Australia. This system of naval bases is a new proposition, which was made in Admiral Henderson&#39;s report. We do not yet know whether the Government has indorsed that report. If it has indorsed it <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> we shall know in what direction we are tending. If it has not indorsed it be yond this particular section then we desire to know on what authority the Prime Minister is proceeding in this direction. For my own part 1 have some doubt that perhaps we may be following too blindly the example of the Mother Country in endeavouring to separate our naval bases from our ordinary mercantile ports. In the Mother Country it is essential to have mercantile ports and naval bases separate, because the constant movements of ships of war would interfere materially with the mercantile shipping. But oui vessels of war are not so numerous or ubiquitous that we need fear that their passing in and out of ports will seriously interfere with the ordinary shipping. I suggest this as a consideration worthy of passing notice, because every penny spent on naval bases which may he unnecessary could be better spent on the construction and arming of ships. Therefore we should be told what is the policy of the Government in this regard. But when we ask for information, our questions are regarded as insults, and our protests as a nefarious attempt to retard the passing of the Estimates. </para>

        <para>The Prime Minister referred to the vote for the Military College. I should be the last to wish to retard the passing of an item of that kind, because the establishment of the Military College was first suggested in this Parliament by me, and agreed to at my instigation. But I should like to know whether the money asked for is for new works, or to repair the blunders of the past year or two? It may be necessary for the rebuilding of the stables, which, apparently, were designed by an architect accustomed to the accommodation provided for horses on shipboard, since so little room was given that the horses could not flick their tails without upsetting the domestic economy of the edifice. These things have constantly to be done because of the departmental bungling under the auspices of this Cabinet of business men. There is another item of &#163;80,000- </para>

            <para>- I am doing so only by way of illustration. The Prime Minister told us that &#163;80.000 is asked for to provide drill halls and mobilization stores. There are 200 military areas, and if each area is to get a hall, which is what I understood from his lucid explanation, there will be something like &#163;490 for the site and building in each case. But, in addition, out of this amount, we are to have mobilization stores. </para>

The Prime Minister, who, at this last hour, was going to afford us every information, though in a spirit that, to me, seemed hardly gracious, has misled us, and we have to trust to the cryptic utterances of the Honorary Minister for the correction of the wrong impression made upon our minds by his chief. </para>

            <para>- That is the question.. We still do not know how many areas are to&#39;have drill halls, and how many mobilization stores are to be provided? The sum provided for training the levies under our new system is, according to the Minister&#39;s interjection, only about one-fourth of what will be necessary eventually. If we have to wait four years, what evidence is there of this determined haste to proceed with our military organization of which we heard a few minutes ago from the Prime Minister? I am the last person to desire to hold up the Estimates, but I want something in the nature of a reasoned explanation of them. Perhaps it is hopeless to expect -that from Ministers, though I should like a broad, comprehensive statement of policy in regard to the large question of Australian defence. Indeed, I despair of getting it from Ministers. The Prime Minister, in his hotheaded attack on the Opposition for having the temerity to ask questions, did not do himself or us justice. We are here to ask questions, to try to find out what is being done with the public&#39;s money. When we asked what Ministers are spending on themselves, there was an uproar; and now that we wish to know how they propose to spend money on big . public enterprises, we are threatened with a bludgeon. </para>

          <para>.- While the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, Ministers were very loud and persistent in their assertions that all the information asked for by the Opposition had been given. I wisn,&#39; therefore, to draw attention to a specific instance to the contrary . I noticed with surprise that  &#163;&#91;5,000  is set down for the construction of a new General Post Office at Perth. On the. face of it, that is an absurd proposal. I wished to know what the plans of the Government are ; what was its object in placing this item on the Estimates; whether there was any further development to announce; and when the building was likely to be taken in hand ? On these points, I have not yet received a word of explanation. The people of Perth and of Western Australia have been clamouring for this post-office for several years. Since it was promised, they have been awaiting impatiently the erection of the building. The site has been acquired, I believe, the Minister of Home Affairs having busied himself about the matter when in Perth recently. I understand that a plan was drawn - I saw a reproduction of it in a newspaper some time ago - in which the post-office was relegated to a sort of backyard, and was surrounded with shops and warehouses. That plan has been discarded, as it deserved to be ; but we are yet in the dark as to what is to take its place. This matter is important enough to require more explanation than has been given. If an explanation is not forthcoming, I must take it that the Ministry are in the dark as to what- they are going to do in the matter. The Prime Minister has indicated that, in the item for Naval Works, money is to be found for the creation of a naval base at Cockburn Sound, which, in the opinion of Admiral Henderson, is one of the most necessary and immediate requirements of the Commonwealth. When constructed, it will be the most important naval dep6t of the Commonwealth, and will greatly affect the interests of the Empire.

        <para>Hr. FOWLER.- I am referring to the statement made by the Prime Minister tonight, and I take it he has the most uptodate information. I may have missed this particular item, but I was very much surprised to hear the casual reference made to it by the Prime Minister. If he is not sure what is going to be done at Cockburn Sound, do his officers know precisely what they are going to do? In the absence of definite information, are we to assume that the officers have asked for  &#163;200,000  to be placed at their disposal for naval works, with no definite plan or scheme to enable the country to get full value? If that -is not an unsatisfactory state of affairs, I do not know what is; and the Opposition are fully justified in asking for information. If the Government do not give the information, the country .will demand to know the reason why before long. </para>

          <para>.- There are grave reasons why money should be voted with all speed for new works and buildings ; and my only regret is that we have not a system whereby these accounts are presented much earlier in the year, so that the Department may have the necessary money placed at its disposal at the earliest possible moment. Under the present system, the Minister of Home Affairs is placed in a very difficult position, and we can see that year after year amounts voted are not expended, those last year being very considerable. </para>

            <para>- That is the position. Parliament meets in May or June, and the Estimates ought to be ready  for  Cabinet consideration . by the  end of  May, or the end of June, at latest,  for  submission to the House. They ought, indeed, to be under the consideration of  Ministers  long before the financial year begins, though, so far  as  I know, that is not the practice. It would help the Minister  df  Home Affairs very materially if he  were  given Supply  at  the beginning of the year instead of practically a third of the way through the year. The Department  of  Home Affairs labours under sufficient difficulties as things are at present, if only from the fact that all its servants are  noi  under Federal control. </para>

Much  of  the work of the Home Affairs Department is now carried out in a circumlocutory way. </para>

When the Department has decided that the building is necessary, the Department, of Home Affairs is requested to make the necessary acquisition of land, and the officers in the Department of Home Affairs have to go into the whole question occupying, perhaps, another three months. Then, when these two Departments have decided, the matter has to go on to the Treasurer, who, perhaps, takes another three months to find the money ; and in this way important public works, which are urgently needed, are delayed beyond all reason. </para>

        <para>Let me give an instance in my own electorate. Some years ago, I recommended to the Post and Telegraph Department the wisdom of providing a postoffice in what was obviously going to be the best commercial centre in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. It took about six years to persuade the Department of the common sense of the proposal, and the Department of Home Affairs was then instructed to acquire the site it had chosen. Some trouble was then experienced in getting the Home Affairs Department to indorse the site selected, although, as we have seen, it had taken the Post and Telegraph Department a long time to make up its mind to go to that centre in the first place. After these two Departments had come to one mind as to a site, and after the Home Affairs Department had got an estimate of the value of the site from the New South Wales valuator, the Minister of Home Affairs asked the Treasurer to supply the necessary money. The Treasurer and the Minister of Defence then put their heads together, and they came to the conclusion that the amount asked for was a large one for a piece of land. It was the amount suggested by the New South Wales Government valuator, and represented, I should imagine, the price that the land would fetch in open market. But the Minister of JDefence and the Prime Minister, who had never seen the land,- and knew nothing of the conditions or of the intense competition for sites .in that particular area, decided in their wisdom, and from their wide experience as land valuers, that it was too much to give, and hung the matter up for three or four months. Whilst it was hung up through this circumlocutionary method of transacting business, the Commonwealth had &#34;to go on paying rent for the other place it was occupying - the place it had&#39; taken temporarily to test the value of the locality for departmental purposes. An actual loss, therefore, resulted to the Commonwealth through the delays operating under the present system. I suggest that my honorable friend, whose business ability is recognised by every person opposite, including himself, should cast his eagle eye over a proposition for changing the character of his whole Department from one of circumlocution into one of actual work. . </para>

            <para>- The matter is too serious for badinage. A great deal of delay occurs in the construction of works and in the acquisition of sites when money is provided, and when their non-acquisition with expedition means the paying of rent in some other direction. The only way to abolish unnecessary public expenses of this kind is to make each Government Department responsible for its own small concerns, and the Commonwealth Works Department, the erstwhile circumlocutionary Home Affairs Department, a great Department for carrying on the big National works of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to ask a question with bated breath, after the very lucid and able statement of the case for the railway survey in the Northern Territory delivered by the Prime Minister a little while ago. It really was most informative, and made the position perfectly plain. He said, &#34; This sum is on the Estimates. Nothing can be plainer. There is no more to be said about it.&#34; Somehow or other we are still unsatisfied. I suppose it is because we are unreasonable, and he is the essence and soul of reason. With the greatest possible deference, in the presence of a great authority like the Prime Minister, I humbly take up the position that we ought not to vote money for a survey of that kind until we know what is in the mind of the Government regarding proposals for opening up the Northern Territory by railway communication. Are we to develop it from the north downwards or from the south upwards? The very things we want to know are not in the Estimates. It was a farce to submit these items to the House with nothing in the mind of the Government as to what is to be done with the money when it is &#39;Voted. The Government propose to survey a route for a piece of railway in between the terminal points of two railways on a different gauge. When they have put in that railway, the old narrow gauge will have to be altered. I understand that the sleepers on both sides will have to be taken up before the gauge can be made to fit in with the new line. Surely all these matters ought to be explained to members, and some definite concrete proposal put before them. </para>

Why not provide money for a survey in some other and better climate, or where there is a prospect of opening up some mineral country ? Why not a survey where there is a prospect of joining the railway to some other system, which will make it a paying concern from he first? All these matters ought to be in the minds of Ministers before they ask the House to pass such an item. </para>

          <para>. - The request made by the honorable member for Parramatta is not unreasonable. He asks whether the Minister of External Affairs has evolved a railway policy for the Territory, and, if so, whether the railway survey in respect of which provision is made in these Estimates is part of that policy to which the Committee will commit itself by making this appropriation. As to the other question which has been raised, we have a message from the GovernorGeneral for a further appropriation, and I am not going to make any complaint if the Minister desires to introduce a Bill for the purpose. </para>

          <para>. - The Prime Minister thinks that the fairest course to adopt is to introduce a Bill dealing with this question of the survey, so that the whole matter of the railway policy can be raised in connexion with it. That being so, although the Estimates containing the item in question are passed, no survey will take place until a Bill providing specifically for it has been made law. A general discussion can take place on that Bill. If it is passed the survey will be made ; if it is not the survey will not be proceeded with. </para>

          <para class="block">The object of this Bill may be briefly stated. It is the practice for captains of the ships of the Royal Navy to pay their men according to their ratings, without requiring from them any receipt. Under our Audit Act payment could not be legally made in .that way, and it is now proposed by this Bill so to amend the principal Act that that which has proved to be a satisfactory and convenient arrangement in connexion with  His  Majesty&#39;s ships in the Royal Navy may prevail on vessels of the Australian Unit. The Bill will also permit of the captain or officer commanding any Australian ship to get credit and expend money in circumstances in which it would not be permissible for officers of the Public Service to do so. I am legally advised, and the Treasury also advises me, that the Bill will have that effect, and it is approved without any qualification. We think it necessary, for the efficient government of the Australian Naval Unit, in conformity with the custom and practice on vessels of  His  Majesty&#39;s Royal Navy, to have this power. </para>

Then, again, section .46 provides  that no sum is to be allowed to have been duly received or paid without a voucher, unless by order. If proper safeguards are provided in the regulations, it seems to me that there can be no objection to the Bill. </para>

            <para>.- We amended the Audit Act the year before last to provide for expenditures outside the Commonwealth, so that the provisions of this Bill are not altogether anomalous. Substantially it means that some other method of checking may be substituted for that provided in the Act, but the regulations governing the matter will be subject to the Acts Interpretation Act, that is, they may be disallowed on the resolution of either House. Everything will be done by regulation. There is a provision in the Audit Act dealing with regulations which does not mention this power of Parliament to disallow them, but I think that it is qualified by the provision in the Acts Interpretation Act. If that is so, there seem to me to be sufficient safeguards. </para>

We shall follow the strictest practice of the Royal Navy, and I ask the co-operation of honorable members opposite as well as of my own friends, so that the regulations, while strict enough to protect the public interest, may yet be sufficiently flexible. If they are not, they will be altered speedily. </para>

            <para>. - 1 do not know whether the Prime Minister was aware before, a question was put on the notice-paper of the conditions under which advertising is being obtained from country newspapers, but he informed the House to-day that a lump sum had been provided for the advertising of the Commonwealth Bank, which had been -placed at the disposal of a press agent, who had made such terms with the proprietors of the country newspapers as he thought fit. I have been told that in some instances a two-inch double-column advertisement has. been paid for at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">jQ\</inline> for six.&#39; months. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Prime Minister thinks that the Governor of the Bank, and, I presume, the Government, are absolved from responsibility because a contract has been made with an agent. If there is one thing which I thought this Government would have avoided, it is dealings with middlemen, which always result in sweating. I feel that a great wrong has been done to the proprietors of newspapers, whose necessities prevent them from standing up against this sort of thing. Honorable members know the difficulties under which most country newspapers are conducted, and their proprietors deserve sympathy in connexion with this attempt to extort from them advertisements at low rates. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to appear unkind, but 1 am tempted to say that the Governor of the Bank thought it worth while to put an enormous advertisement in the metropolitan daily papers, in the most expensive position, which virtually only informed the people of Victoria where their post-offices are situated. This high official apparently thought that good business, though the advertisement conveyed little information to intending depositors but a good deal of money to the proprietors of the newspapers in which the advertisement appeared. A Government which professes to stand up for the rights of those&#39; unable to help themselves should say that the country newspapers are not to be treated in this shabby and invidious fashion. We are told by the Prime Minister that the Governor of the Bank is beyond political influence. Surely the right honorable gentleman is not going to allow him to commit a manifest wrong of this sort, and to infringe the policy which the Government says it was specially created to foster and develop.  1  am surprised that the Prime Minister has so readily sheltered himself behind the measure which he introduced to place this high official in such a position that be can not only break down the policy of a Labour Government, but can commit an offence against the sentiment of the Australian public. We do not wish our people to be at the mercy of agents. I have been told that the newspaper proprietors who were strong enough to stand up against the proposals of the agents were given a larger amount than was first tendered. </para>

              <para>- Is that the reflection of the Honorary Minister? The Governor of the Bank is placed beyond political influence, and therefore can uphold those who play the role of sweater ! The fact that the agents increased the amount offered to those newspaper proprietors who were strong enough to decline the first offer shows that there was a margin ; and I wish to know who will benefit by it. It will go, not into the public Treasury, nor to the country press, but into the pockets of the middleman. </para>

              <para>- If the Governor of the Bank is to be free from political influence, he must remain free. He may contract with another party in any way he pleases, subject to the policy of this Parliament and this Government. When the country or other newspapers go to the Condliation and Arbitration Court for an award for proper rates, then will be the proper time to talk of sweating. The Governor must conduct the bank in his own way. I do not know, and there are no facts to show, whether the rates paid are sweating rates. I do know that a number of journals, who do not support Liberalism, never got a Government advertisement for twenty years ; and now trouble is raised because the Governor of the bank is independent, and gives this work to a firm without asking whether there is sweating or not. I do not know the name of the firm, but I believe it to be one of repute. I cannot take responsibility for what the Governor of the Bank has done, because it rests with himself. </para>
