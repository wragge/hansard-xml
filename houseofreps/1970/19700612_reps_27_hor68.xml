          <para class="block">House that some officers of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission - Messrs Davy, Giles and Charash - bad been asked to prepare and deliver this paper at the symposium. Due to a number of factors associated mainly with the preparation of the paper it was not available for delivery at the symposium, but it was indicated that when the paper was completed it would be submitted to the directors of the symposium so that it could be incorporated in the proceedings. Thai paper, which is a private one. has now been finalised and has been sent to the directors of the symposium. They have, very kindly, sent a few copies to me. If the honourable member is interested I certainly can supply him with a copy. As it is a private document it cannot, of course, bc tabled in the House, but I can make copies available. I think that the honourable member for Lang was interested in this matter, and I will forward a copy to him. If the Leader of the Opposition is interested 1 will certainly see that a copy is sent to him. There are a few spare copies that I will make available to any member of the Press Gallery who is interested in seeing what is a personal and private paper concerning a very important subject. </para>

            <para>- There has been progressively over the last few years an increase in jet services not only on the major trunk routes but to major country centres. It is expected, of course, that this increase in jet services will continue to expand in the future. There are certain standard types of jets operating on the major trunk routes in &#34;Australia at the moment, for example, the Boeing 727 which is a main trunk route aircraft and the Douglas DC9 which can operate from certain strips such as Canberra and some other strips in country areas. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There has been introduced into Western Australia an intermediate type jet - the Fokker, F28 - which can operate from smaller strips than those required for the DC9. At the moment, 1 know, the airlines are considering replacements for certain of their intermediate type of aircraft and I. would not doubt that at some point of time in the future there will be additional intermediate sized jet aircraft operating. This brings up the whole question of the services to country areas. I know my colleague in another place, the Minister for Civil Aviation, is carefully studying this matter, lt raises many questions in relation to the upgrading of airports because many airports in Australia are under the local ownership scheme whereby there is a sharing of the capital cost and maintenance in relation to the upgrading of airports. But I will certainly bring the question to the notice of my colleague in another place and see whether any further information can bc provided. </para>

            <para>- 1 have in fact had an opportunity to see the Press reports of the speech made by the honourable member for Sturt. I have not yet been able to examine the Hansard report. But if the reports contained in the newspapers are correct 1 would Like to say that the allegations made are themselves incorrect. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is a matter for regret that we have to discuss at this juncture these allegations when the soldier was killed last Saturday and funeral arrangements have not been finalised. But in fairness to the Army it should be pointed out that not only was this soldier medically examined by the Department of Labour and National Service, then by the Army when he marched in and then subsequent to his basic recruit training, but also as a consequence of receiving representations by the honourable member for Sturt I specifically requested a further report on this soldier and he was examined in February of this year. For the fourth time, he was found to be medically fit for service everywhere. </para>
          <para>I have to point out in view of the allegation - and it is understandable if a family is concerned about a national serviceman who is wearing glasses - that this person could not see more than 4 feet in front of him- </para>

              <para>- Let me finish the answer because it is of the utmost importance. 1 do not want any unwarranted emotion introduced by honourable members opposite. The Army&#39;s minimum standard of acceptable unaided vision is that which would enable a soldier without spectacles to distinguish a stationary object such as a man at approximately 125 metres. With movement, this distance would be greater. </para>

          <para>The Assistant Director of Medical Services in Eastern Command advised me at the time I received the representations that this man was medically fit. He had been asked specifically to look at this matter in relation to the question of spectacles and in relation to the man&#39;s vision without spectacles. Taking into account the 3 earlier examinations that had been made, I had to reach the decision that on 4 occasions the man had been found to be medically fit. On the basic requirement that I have just enunciated, I had no option but to see that he went with his unit to Vietnam. It is a matter for regret that his father believes that the boy could not see more than 4 feet in front of him without spectacles. But it is quite clear- </para>

              <para>- Well, I know that the honourable member has matters on this point We have discussed them and the honourable member knows as well as I do that I am concerned not only about this soldier but also about general policy in regard to servicemen who wear spectacles. But I am discussing only this incident at this time. It was stated also by the honourable member for Sturt that the spectacles required by this man were available in only 1 capital city. Again, prior to making my decision, I questioned whether this was so. I was advised that it was not so and that they were available in South Vietnam and throughout Australia. We did, of course, supply the soldier with 2 pairs of spectacles at the time. I have nothing further to add because I have not read all of the allegations made by the honourable member for Sturt, but I shall do so. Little opportunity has been available, because of the sittings of the Parliament, to examine the Hansard report but the specific allegation, which received some publicity, about the distance which this soldier could see was something that I believed should be clarified and I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify it. </para>

            <para>- Before I address my question to the Minister for Labour and National . Service may I congratulate you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> on the clemency and understanding that you showed in a very difficult situation yesterday. It was a good deed in a naughty world. I hope that no further incidents of that nature occur. I address my question to the Minister for Labour and National Service. Is he aware of the rising resentment amongst the staff of Parliament House at all levels at the callous disregard of their personal welfare shown by his handling of the hours of meeting? Is he aware that many of the staff in the refreshment rooms have reached a stage of absolute exhaustion and that demands are being imposed on all staff in Parliament House which would not be tolerated in any industrial establishment? Would the Minister agree that the Parliament is served by a staff unsurpassed for devotion to duty and unfailing courtesy to all concerned? Is he aware that he has damaged the morale of the people upon whom Parliament depends for its effective functioning, and that industrial action could be taken to right their grievances? How does he equate bis disregard for the employees of this institution with his duty as Minister for Labour and National Service, to see that other employers abide by the spirit of modern industrial practice? Before the Parliament resumes for the next period of sitting, will he confer with representatives of the staff at all levels, high and low, as well as the Joint House Department and the Joint House Committee and adopt working hours showing some common sense instead of the staggering incompetence which has been demonstrated over the past few weeks? </para>

There is undeniably an overwhelming feeling in this House thai everybody wants to go home. That is the way everybody speaks to me in the corridors, in the House and everywhere else. If anybody is prepared to deny that the overwhelming majority wants this Parliament to cease he is free to say so.  His  view will be judged by all other honourable members here who, like me, are subject to the same feelings and the same experiences, having talked to their colleagues. So far as the staff is concerned I moved a motion the other day in relation to standing order 103. I said then that I had been asked by staff of all kinds serving this institution when we would be getting up. The Opposition said: How extraordinary. Here is the Leader of the House saying he is concerned about the staff. The members of the staff are not the people to be concerned about. The people to be concerned about are the members of the Parliament.&#39; Today the honourable member says the only group we are to be concerned about is the staff. </para>

However I must add that this Parliament exists under the Constitution and in the parliamentary system to conduct the business of Parliament and government. If the House decide? to sit, it is a matter of enough staff being available to serve. It is true that there are occasions when much greater pressures arc put on the staff and on those occasions they respond magnificently. I take this opportunity to express to the staff my great appreciation for this as 1 have no doubt you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> do. </para>

In view of the big variation in the retail price of rural chemicals which play such an important part in the costs of the primary producer, can the Minister advise the House how prices of such chemicals have moved in recent years?

            <para>- It is a fact that both in ordinary agricultural farming and in livestock husbandry the use of chemical formulations is increasingly important. I am sure that those of us who engage in farming would not know how we could carry on these days without the aid of these chemical formulations. As the farmers express a continuing concern at the price of the formulations I have made it my business to keep a close watch on price movements. Between 1965 and 1969 I had a list compiled and continuously updated of the price move ments of the 74 listed chemical formulations used in rural activities. Over that period 60 of the 74 items have been reduced in price. There has been no price alteration in respect of 6 of the items, and only 8 items have been increased in price. As thi:, is a matter of great concern to agriculturalists, with the approval of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a document setting out the chemicals, their prices, and the alterations. </para>

          <para>The following table shows the price movement in recent ye;irs of chemical formulations in common use by rural producers. Earlier tables showed the situation before and after adoption by the Government of the Tariff Board&#39;s 1966 report on Industrial Chemicals. </para>

The fact is that the official machine for which 1 am now responsible has a great task to do. lt generally is very overloaded and all these matters take a great deal of time and absorb a lot of energy. Naturally priorities have to be given. It would be nice to do an infinite number of things. I gather that the honourable member is quite happy and satisfied and I will leave him in that condition as often as I can. </para>

Have officers of his Department recently conducted a survey or inquiry into the problems and economics of the gold mining industry? If so, is he now able to tell the House whether it is intended to re-enact the general provisions of the Gold Mining Assistance Act which expires at the end of this month? Can he tell the House also whether there is any intention of, or whether consideration is being given to, substantially increasing the amount of assistance now provided under the Act? </para>

            <para>- The answer is no. The report of the interdepartmental dockyard docking facility committee is expected at about the end of this month, lt was my hope  -  I think the hope was shared by my colleague, the Minister for Defence - that the report would have been available at the end of May but, alas, our hopes did not materialise. I am optimistic that it will be available at the end of June. Of course, when it is available the action that may be appropriate to the circumstances will be taken. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Education and Science. Has his attention been directed to an article in the 3rd June issue of the Brisbane &#39;Courier Mail&#39; which stated that the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane would have to raise a large sum of money, namely SI. 5m of an eventual $5m, which it states will be necessary to prevent the collapse of its school system? In view of the Government&#39;s support of the dual system of education and the strain that would be placed on government schools and teaching staff if the independent school system was to fail, will the Minister examine the position of both independent and government schools with the object of increasing Commonwealth assistance in areas of greatest need in our education system? </para>

            <para>-I did see the report, and I would point out to the honourable member that the Australian Education Council has been conducting a survey of needs in secondary and primary education in Australia. This survey, which was originated by State Liberal governments with Commonwealth co-operation, included also a survey of the needs of independent schools. Members know it is the policy of Liberal governments that all Australians are entitled to a proper standard of education. The results of that survey were before a meeting of the Australian Education Council last Monday fortnight. The figures in regard to independent schools are not complete because the schools are not centralised in their administration in the same way as are State schools. The figures in relation to State schools are under consideration. I assure the honourable member that the Government will be considering the needs of them and of independent schools in the light of its usual policy. </para>

In view of the obvious need for such facilities for teachers and others who cannot physically attend a university, is there any action which his Department can take to see that external studies are made available for those desirous of furthering their education at tertiary level? </para>

            <para>- There are certain universities which conduct substantial external courses, in particular the New England, Macquarie and Queensland universities. In Victoria the University of Melbourne has been reducing this activity. There is a distinct need for certain people to be able to undertake external studies. Seeing this need, the Australian Universities Commission recommended doubling the allowance which was made for this in dealing with the requirements of universities in its last report in order to encourage universities, and particularly universities in Victoria, to undertake further external studies courses. The recommendation was accepted. The response has been disappointing. 1 myself have had some discussion with the vice chancellor of Monash University. The most that that university is prepared to offer is external studies courses in education for graduates. This of course did not touch the need with which the Universities Commission was concerned. Further efforts have been made to encourage universities to provide external studies courses for undergraduates but so far without success. It is not only the State Government but also the Commonwealth which would like to see these courses introduced. If further funds for particular courses were required a proposition could be put if finance were a difficulty. But as I understand it, it is not the difficulty, and certainly no proposition has been put forward. The problem appears to be that some universities are reluctant to undertake this type of activity. </para>

              <para>- I know of no such study. 1 did see some reports of remarks made by a spokesman on behalf of the Australian Clothing Manufacturers Council but there is no study that I know of by the Department and that Council. What that Council is doing is inquiring into ways of attracting more women into the work force. My own Department does not have a study for the purpose of attracting women into the work force, lt realises the reality of the situation which is that for social reasons and because of community attitudes more women are going into the work force. </para>

              <para>- There has been quite a remarkable growth in the number of women in the work force. In the 1960s that number grew from about 27% to about 33%. The number of married women in the work force doubled from 9% to 18%. My attitude and that of the Department through me is not to attract women into the work force but to recognise that women are going into the work force. Therefore we have to deal with the problems for them and for the community which are created by their entry into the work force. I wanted to make that clear. I dd not want the statement to go unanswered by me as though I acquiesced in it. I have made clear my own point of view. Women in rural areas constitute a very real problem in relation to decentralisation. They constitute a very real problem in leaving their homes in rural areas and going to the cit:es. For those who remain there is the real problem of finding employment. We are constantly looking at this matter, but I cannot promise any easy solution. </para>

            <para>- My question refers to the recent statement on university salaries by the Minister for Education and Science. I refer to the one major recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Eggleston&#39;s report which I believe is educationally unfortunate, namely, the award of a lesser percentage increase at the bottom of the lecturing scale than at the higher levels. Will the Minister give active consideration to redressing this differential treatment in a field of employment where the problem of attracting first class teachers or lecturers is more serious than that of holding established professors and where responsibility of work load and accountability for decisions taken are probably more equally shared than in any other field, including parliamentary office? </para>

            <para>-I point out to the honourable member that the report was obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Eggleston and his assessors at the request of State governments, which have a very large financial stake in the question of salaries for professors and lecturers. The report did draw a distinction between lecturers and those above that position and awarded an increase of a lower percentage to lecturers. I understand that this was in accordance with the representations made to the Eggleston Committee by both the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and the ViceChancellors&#39; Committee. This differential was inherent in their representations although not the precise percentages which were adopted. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In these circumstances I do not think that the Commonwealth Government should actively intervene to alter this position at this stage but should, as it has done, stand by the report. However, I would add that some State governments are considering the establishment of a committee to consider on a work value basis the various academic positions. This will take a longer time. It is quite probable that the committee will be appointed. If so, it could undertake to look at that matter. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Education and Science a question supplementary to that asked him by the honourable member for Maranoa. The honourable gentleman will recall telling me on 2nd June that the printed report of the survey of education needs in government schools would be available generally in about a month from the date of the meeting of the Education Council, which was on 25th May. I ask: When will the survey of education needs in non-government schools be completed and similarly made available? </para>

            <para>-I should remind the Leader of the Opposition that this survey is obtained by the Australian Education Council which consists of the State Ministers for Education. I am not strictly a member of that Council although I do attend by invitation part of its proceedings. Therefore it does not rest with me to say what will be published and when it will be published. Having said that, I do confirm that so far as the report dealing with government schools is concerned it was the hope expressed by the State Ministers for Education who constitute the Council that they would be able to print and release the report in about a month. If they make any change in that it would be not a matter over which I had any control. As to the independent schools, although some figures which are quite accurate in certain States were available there are other areas where the figures are still being gathered. It is very difficult to say when the final figures for those States will be available and therefore even more difficult to say when the report could be made available or whether the State Ministers for Education would see fit to publish it when they received it. </para>

            <para>- The Australian Wool Board commissioned the publication of this document on the Joint Organisation and as the honourable member said 2,000 copies were printed. I believe that about 700 have been distributed but I have no idea of the number distributed in the last 12 months. Anybody who wants a copy of the publication can write to the Board. It is available for purchase at $2.50. Whether this booklet should be distributed more widely is, I think, a matter for the Board to determine. People who are interested ought to get is touch with the Board. </para>

            <para>- I express my appreciation to the Prime Minister. Recently, at the request of the shire of Wade which has its headquarters in the town of Griffith where I reside, I circulated a submission to all members of the Ministry and all members of the House of Representatives. The submission by the shires of Carrathool, Leeton, Murrumbidgee and Narrandera as well as Wade dealt with the desired establishment of a university in the Riverina. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have had replies from most members of the Ministry, and many members of the Parliament, some helpful, some neutral, some critical but all much appreciated. I have forwarded them all to the shire. On Wednesday I received a copy of a letter dated 5th June addressed by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holten)</inline> to the Wade Shire Council and to 4 other shires in my electorate. The Minister for Repatriation did not reply to my letter or to my representations as did other Ministers and members. Instead he wrote directly, and behind my back, to 5 local government authorities in my electorate. In the first paragraph of that letter the Minister wrote: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>| have consulted with veteran parliamentarians and legal authorities and they agree that the Minister&#39;s statement is a gross breach of parliamentary ethics and ministerial responsibility and is also a most serious reflection on my personal integrity. I want to say, by way of explanation, that J have never at any time in any place had any personal discussion on dealings with the Minister which could possibly excuse or justify his unethical action. The Minister has never at any time challenged me or queried me in any way in the course of either my parliamentary duties or my personal conduct and I submit that the Minister has been guilty of a serious libel. </para>
          <para>I further submit that he has been guilty of conduct which prejudices the relationships which in a democratic Parliament such as ours must prevail between a member and a Minister. He has, in this instance, broken an important parliamentary tradition - the right of a member to seek and receive from a Minister information on and replies to matters raised on behalf of his constituents. Without excuse he has broken this tradition and made serious, if entirely fictitious, imputations against my personal integrity. I have mentioned to the Minister that I would deal with his conduct in the House. I hope that he will reconsider his unethical lapse and withdraw and apologise. If he acted in an unthinking way, it is forgivable; if he acted under the strain, in his first portfolio, of grappling with the problems of repatriation as a junior Minister, this is understandable. But it would be a challenge to all that is sound and good in our parliamentary tradition of ministerial responsibility to members if he persisted in his gross breach of parliamentary ethics. </para>
          <para>The Minister has failed in this instance, I suggest, to distinguish between his role as a member of a political party and his duties as a Minister of State. This was not a political matter - not a contentious matter - merely the submission by 5 local government bodies for a university. I conclude by saying that I have never at any time in my public career, either in the Parliament of New South Wales or in private bodies or in the national Parliament - had a slur cast on my personal integrity. I submit that if the Minister is honourable, as a member of an honourable House he should accord honour to those who serve in it. </para>

              <para>- The report outlines the history of the inquiry which will serve to remind the House that much of the inquiry remained incomplete when the present Committee was appointed in November 1969. Since then a considerable amount of evidence has been taken and the Committee has undertaken many inspections. lt is considered desirable to report on some aspects of the inquiry at this stage, both because aspects of the problem of aircraft noise need urgent attention and because the Committee is able to conclude some sections of the inquiry. Consequently some important recommendations aimed at alleviating aspects of the aircraft noise problem are placed before you in this interim report. </para>

          <para>We have endeavoured to lay down guiding principles for use, generally, in Australia and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Specific problem areas are considered so as to arrive at guidelines for policy in mitigating some of the most annoying effects of exposure to aircraft noise. For some of the terms of reference the report is final though there are others on which evidence is incomplete and it is in respect of these that the Committee proposes to report and to conclude its inquiry by the end of this calendar year. The inquiry had its genesis in the conflict of interests arising from the needs of a progressively developing air transport industry and increasing urbanisation. Reactions to aircraft noise exposure are manifested in complaints and protests from persons in areas adjacent to mainland city airports where a high intensity of jet aircraft movement is experienced. </para>
          <para>The operating need and procedures of this industry give rise to a noise nuisance which may prejudice the beneficial uses of otherwise desirable neighbourhoods. The aircraft industry serves large centres of population for whom ils activities have become an undisputed necessity, but the progressive introduction of the jet engined aircraft has resulted in a steadily increasing noise nuisance. The Committee foresees problems of greater magnitude in the decade ahead unless immediate and concerted action is taken effectively to control land use in airport neighbourhoods. The Committee has studied overseas developments which indicate the gravity of future problems for Australia in the absence of remedial action. The Committee believes that the solution is a matter of comprehensive urban planning to ensure continued benefit from a thriving air transport industry whilst still having due regard to the well being and welfare of the community which it serves. </para>
          <para>The Committee wishes to pay a tribute to the co-operation given by officers of the Department of Civil Aviation, the Department of Air and airline companies. At this stage I wish to say that the success of the inquiry so far has been enhanced by the ever courteous and willing response by officers of both these Departments and companies to the Committee&#39;s very demanding requests for information and assistance. I personally am greatly indebted to the ever willing help given by the  Clerk  to the Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce</inline> Chapman, the Research Officer <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> Hale and our stenographer <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Ashurst</inline> in the very arduous task of preparing the material for this report and express my thanks to them. 1 also thank the honourable members for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> and KingsfordSmith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> without whose co-operation in the intensive revision of the terms of this report it could not have been completed in time for tabling to-day. </para>

I also express appreciation to him - the honourable member could not do it himself - for the manner in which he, the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison)</inline> and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> have worked. It has been a difficult matter to sort out and they have done a good job on it. There are a couple of points in the report to which I would like to refer. All except one of the recommendations were unanimous and I was odd man out on one with which I will deal in a moment or two. I hope that the Department will take due heed of recommendations 11 and 12 on page 2 of the report. Recommendation 1 1 is as follows: at Sydney during the hours of curfew (11 p.m. to 6 a.m.) movements be confined to operations over Botany Bay except in cases of emergency. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I asked a question recently about the number of movements out of Sydney during curfew hours. When I spoke during the the adjournment debate on the subject I expressed the opinion that normal flights being held up as a result of inclement weather or unserviceability of aircraft could be accepted as one of the facts of life. Unfortunately people delayed in those circumstances have to be carried at that time of the night. We did find from the answer to the question I asked that some 170-odd movements out of Sydney were scheduled flights. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I thank the honourable member for his assistance. The movements were jet movements. There were turbo prop and piston engine movements other than the movements I have spoken about. These were all scheduled flights that were permitted at holiday time. I said that in my opinion Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia have insufficient aircraft to meet the requirements of the travelling public today and that the departments, the Government, and these 2 airlines should do something about rectifying the matter. We who travel all the time find consistently that when we go to an airport to catch a plane at a particular time it is held up because a plane - not the plane serving the ports to which we wish to travel - could not get out of some other port because of weather or unserviceability. There is clear evidence that these 2 airlines are completely undermanned and have insufficient aircraft. If they are not prepared to get sufficient aircraft to meet their requirements I do not think people should be unnecessarily disturbed in the hours of sleep between 1 1 p.m. and 6 a.m. The airlines will have to make do with what they have if they are not prepared to buy more aircraft. 1 would also like to draw attention to recommendation 12. lt should be borne in mind that strong pressure is being exerted to lift the curfew in certain places, such as at Tullamarine Airport. Once a start is made to break down the curfew in 1 place extreme pressure is imposed for other places to keep up with the Joneses. This is imposing great pressure on other airports to follow the lead in lifting the curfew. The fact that Perth has no curfew is unfortunate for the people who live there. There are a considerable number of people living adjacent to the airport who would welcome a curfew at Perth. All I can say to those people who are conducting the campaign at the moment to lift the curfew at Tullamarine - some people say there is no curfew there at this stage - is that I think there should be a curfew and I am clear and frank about it. The airlines can work between 6 a.m. and 1 1 p.m. and that should be sufficient for most people who want to travel. All the airlines are worrying about is being able to carry freight in the main in that time. Let them find airports that are completely isolated. | have been saying for some time in this place that it is time the Department of Civil Aviation came up with some recommendations on the construction of new airports so that they will not cause any inconvenience or nuisance to people. Tullamarine in its initial planning stages probably met this requirement to a very limited degree but unfortunately since the site was selected the Department of Civil Aviation has tried to do it on the cheap. Instead of buying sufficient land and saying: This will remain rural land&#39;, people have been allowed to encroach almost onto the boundaries of Tullamarine. The mistake has been made and if the airlines want to operate passenger or freight services at night the airports should be kept sufficiently away from residential development. They can do what they like as long as they do not disturb anyone. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>All recommendations but one were carried unanimously and that was No. 16. I was the odd man out there. I give credit to my friend, the honourable member for St George, for being able to convince the Committee that he was right in suggesting that the angle of approach to Sydney airport should be increased from 2.76 degrees to 3 degrees. I give him full marks for convincing the Committee that this should bc permitted. It is only at those airports throughout the world where there is a problem with the approach path that an angle greater than 2.76 degrees is permitted. The angle of approach at some of the major airports is below 2.75 degrees. I will cite some of them. At Athens the angle of approach is 2.75 degrees; at Auckland in New Zealand it is 2.5 degrees; Bangkok, 2.5 degrees; Christchurch. NZ. 2.5 degrees; Djakarta 2.6 degrees; Frankfurt 2.7 degrees; and at Kuala Lumpur it is 2.9 degrees. Originally it was 3.3 degrees at Kuala Lumpur but when pressure was put on it was reduced to 2.9 degrees. At Kennedy Airport in New York it is 2.63 degrees. At Orly in Paris it is 2.75 degrees. </para>
          <para>I could cite a few others. At the same time I admit that at Amsterdam it is 3 degrees. In the United Kingdom the authorities appear to hive introduced a more or less universal system with an angle of approach of 3 degrees. I do nol know the reason for it because at Heathrow. which, as honourable members who have bren to the United Kingdom know, is the major airport there is no approach pattern problem. Aircraft could come in easily at 2.75 degrees or 2.5 degrees. They have no hills to contend with such as they have at Bombay where the approach path is 3.3 degrees. The authorities there had to spend a considerable amount of money to remove the tops of some of the hills. </para>
          <para>I appreciate the problem of the honourable member for St George, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith and my mate the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> but I also appreciate the problem for the pilots. One has to appreciate that increasing the angle of approach from 2.75 degrees to 3 degrees represents a rate of sink for aircraft of between 80 feet and 100 feet per minute. I am concerned about the safety of people in aircraft. I appreciate the problems of people who live near airports but I have been assured by people in a position to know that the reduction in noise will be so infinitesimal that it will not matter. It will have no effect on those people. Admittedly, at certain points beneath the approach to the east-west runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport there will be a psychological effect. People will not have the impression that they can touch the aircraft by putting up their hand. At least the aircraft will be another 80 feet or 100 feet higher. There will be a psychological effect but there will be no marked reduction in the noise level. </para>
          <para>I understand that the internal and external airlines have no strong objection about the decision to increase the angle of approach to 3 degrees. However if people get the idea of trying to increase it beyond 3 degrees there could be very strong objections from the operators on technical grounds. 1 do not know the reaction of the pilots but the airline operators do not want it increased beyond 3 degrees. If the recommendations of the Committee are adopted then the angle of approach has been taken to the maximum. Admittedly there are airports in the world with greater angles of approach but the circumstances there are different to those in Australia. </para>
          <para>In my opinion there is only one real answer to the noise problem at Mascot, Adelaide and Brisbane. Probably, as a member of the Committee, I should not prejudge the matter but from the evidence already presented to the Committee I am firmly of the opinion that there is only 1 solution for those 3 airports. Probably, to a lesser degree, it is the same at Perth. The only solution is that alternative sites must be selected immediately and not in 3 err 4 years time. This is the only way in which positive practical relief can be given to the people who have a hell of a problem to put up with, particularly at Mascot. The Department of Civil Aviation should be making this decision. The Opposition, as honourable members are aware, wanted to increase the Committee&#39;s terms of reference so that it could come up with a recommendation. The Committee could do the job. There are a lot of experienced men on the Committee and they have been inquiring into these problems. However, instead, the matter is in the hands of the Department. We know how often government departments shelve things and keep them out of sight until such time as the Government finally makes a decision, whether favourable or unfavourable. As the position stands at the moment it is my humble opinion that the only solution for the people of Sydney is to get Mascot out of the way. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I want to congratulate the  Chairman  of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise, the honourable member for McMillan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Buchanan).</inline> Each member of the Committee realises the amount of time that he has put into this inquiry so that he could present this interim report at this time. I think other members of the Committee&#39; would like me also to express our appreciation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce</inline> Chapman, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> Hale and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Rose of the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, all of whom rendered great service to the Committee. </para>

          <para>The manufacturers of aircraft engines are doing a worthwhile job in endeavouring to reduce the noise of engines but the modifications required are very costly. The cost amounts to some hundreds of thousands of dollars. But worse still, each modification reduces the efficiency of the engine and increases the running cost. This is a very difficult problem that has to be overcome. </para>
          <para>The Committee as previously constituted did an excellent job and produced an interim report. There has been a happy and worthwhile association between the members of this Committee. Individually they have spent a great deal of time and have put a great deal of effort into bringing this report before the Parliament. There are many suggestions. There is a disposition now to realise that aircraft noise is a nuisance and the various factors within the industry are endeavouring to overcome or to alleviate the noise nuisance. Efforts in this regard will be continued in the future. There is an awareness of the problem. lt is peculiar to think that a man will build on a river bank to be close to water. We could establish an international airport in a wilderness and within 12 months thousands of people would he residing nearby, lt would appear that the days of using a small area for an international airport are gone and that the minimum area for an international airport will be 20,000 acres to 25,000 acres. In other countries an area of 50,000 acres is being considered. 1 again commend all who were associated with this report for their loyalty and the amount of work that they put into it. </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  I have not read the interim report of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise but I do hope that it recommends something very constructive in regard to this important problem. As the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> has said. 170 movements of jets have been scheduled out of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport between 1 1 p.m. and 6 a.m. in recent months and the whole 170 went over the Grayndler electorate. 1 hope that the Committee has brought down some good recommendations because, from what 1 can see. in recent months the traffic out of Mascot has intensified day and night, but particularly at night, lt seems that runway 16 carries all of the aircraft which then fly from one end of the Grayndler electorate to the other. Whilst the Committee may be doing excellent work for various electorates, the only practical result that 1 have seen to date is that every plane flies over the Grayndler electorate. I do nol know why. I criticise the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> because he personally okays the 1 1 p.m. to 6 a.m. flights. Some 170 have been approved by the Minister. The planes are flying over the most densely populated areas of Sydney - Sydenham, Marrickville, Leichhardt and s3 on. </para>

              <para>-  I refer lo the answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Newcastle, in which 170 flights were listed. Why does the Minister agree to these planes flying out at that time during holiday periods? Ansett Airlines of Australia, for instance, sent a plane out of Darwin at 2 a.m. on one occasion, it being claimed that it was done to meet the convenience of people who wanted to fly. The real reason was that the airline made more money by flying that plane around the south instead of flying the scheduled flight. The Minister has no right to OK these flights at that time of night and I place on record my resentment in regard to it. I hope that the report condemns the Minister for allowing these flights after curfew hours to th: detriment of the people concerned. I think that the electorate of the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> is somewhere on the same beam as is my electorate.  His  constituents are probably concerned about this, too. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member says that there were 170 at the same time. In regard to the siting of aerodromes. L suggest that the major aerodrome should be at Alice Springs. That might sound silly, but these days why should not international passengers land in a place like that and from there bc taken to the various parts of the Commonwealth? It is a major complaint that the Government has failed to allow the siting of aerodromes to be considered by this Committee. I asked for only 5 minutes, so until I read the report 1 merely register a complaint on behalf of the 125,000 people in my district, nearly every one of whom has been driven mad by these out-of-curfew hours flights which use runway 16. I hope that some recommendations have been made about this problem. 1 was amazed at what happened the other clay when flying to Sydney from Canberra. When we were out near Tom Ugly&#39;s Bridge and the plane should have gone straight over the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison),</inline> who was sitting beside me on the plane, it veered away to the north somewhere and flew over the length and bread! h of the Grayndler electorate. As sure as though it was missile directed, it came in at Leichhardt and finished at Mascot. I even waved to my wife as wc went over the centre of my electorate because the plane was so low and so close. This happens repeatedly with flights from Canberra. 1 suppose I have to lake my share of the planes that fly over the Grayndler electorate but now and again in the St George and Barton electorates they could take the odd plane, could they not? I think that pilots have been instructed to fly this course over my district to and from runway 16. </para>

          <para>Whilst commending the Committee on what I understand to be an excellent report. I hope that it is practical. Even if it is not within the terms of reference, I think there should be an addendum that the aerodrome should be built at Alice Springs or somewhere else and. above all else, that the pilots occupy- </para>

          <para>- This document was given to me at a time when it was presumed that there would be approximately 2 hours for this debate. It it had come on as it ought to have come on virtually immediately after question time it would have come on at 10.42, which would have made the debate short enough. It would have allowed us 2 hours, which in all conscience is short enough onthese important measures. But we have spent something like 45 minutes on other business at the expense of this matter. I merely suggest that the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> had in mind allowing approximately 2 hours for this debate. I protest even about that. But I think at least he ought to restore the 2 hours and now bring down an amended schedule that will allow us 2 hours from the time he puts this urgency proposition. There are a number of people who want to speak on these Bills. </para>

          <para>-  It is certainly a fact that I thought there would be the better part of 2 hours for this debate because I expected to move this motion at the end of question time. The formal business on the Notice Paper, particularly the matter relating to aircraft noise, ran away from us. I think it would have been abouta quarter-past11 by the time we got on to the interim report of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. It is now near enough to a quarter-to 12. Without removing the ground for protest that may have originally existed, I would be prepared, in relation to the specific issue now before the House, to alter the allotment of time by adding 30 minutes to the times which I originally proposed. In doing so. I would remind the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that if time is taken up debating the allotment of time this will only diminish the time that will be available to debate the Bills. 1 move: </para>

              <para>-  The honourable member points to a precedent that slightly lessens my argument on historical circumstances. lt is certainly true of the tax measure, but we have had examples where marketing legislation could not be followed unless certain things were done at the State level. What is proposed here is a scheme by which the Commonwealth will collect, on behalf of the States, taxes which, if levied separately by the States, would be regarded as unconstitutional. Two cases relating to these taxes have been decided by the High Court of Australia. The first case was instituted by the Hamersley Company against the Government of Western Australia and one was instituted in Victoria by a motor car firm, the name of which I cannot recall. The decisions in those cases were that a large part of the receipt taxes that were being imposed by the States of Victoria and Western Australia were unconstitutional because they were, in the view of the High Court, excise taxes, and the Constitution provides that only the Commonwealth may levy an excise. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We have 5 measures that 1 have described as a schemata, or a scheme of arrangement. The States Receipts Duty (Administration) Bill seeks to appoint a collecting agent in each of the States for excise and customs duties. Then there is a Bill to deal with excise and one to deal with customs, as the Constitution provides that only one subject of taxation can be dealt with in each measure. Another Bill invokes section 96, under which the Commonwealth may make grants to the States. What in essence is to happen is that the Commonwealth&#39;s legal authority is to be used to impose what has been described as an excise tax, which is also in some cases pardy a customs duty, the Commonwealth will use the State as an instrumentality to collect that tax, and such moneys as are paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth as a result of these measures will then be paid over to the various States in terms of  section 96. </para>
          <para>That position is bad enough without at this stage discussing the inequitable nature of this tax. 1 merely point out the devious constitutional contrivance that has had to be undertaken to give this system any legality. The further objection is that these taxes purport to be imposed on behalf of the States. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> took issue with my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the other day. The Prime Minister in his Press statement of 10th June 1970, No. 65 of 1970, chided the Leader of the Opposition in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline>seems to be under 2 false impressions. One is that it is he and not the Government which decides what are election issues. The other is that he is thwarting the Commonwealth Government when in fact he is thwarting the States. He is apparently threatening that the Labor Party in the States House, the Senate, will deny the States access to a field of growth tax to which they want access, and trying to claim that this affects the Commonwealth Government. In fact, in this matter, the Commonwealth Government is only acting at the request of the States, as the agent for the States, to enable them to collect revenue in the future which they would not otherwise be able to collect. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">All I would submit is that if the Prime Minister claims that this is being done at the request of the States 1 am sure that the States would wish that he observed a lot more of their requests with the same sort of enthusiasm as he seems to be willing to apply to this one alone.

          <para class="block">That is a very different attitude from the one the Prime Minister took when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte first suggested imposing this tax, particularly as it applied to wages. The Prime Minister continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Labor will therefore deny the Slates the capacity to help themselves in the future. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If this sort of flimsy justification is given to sanction any sort of unjust tax merely on the ground that, as the Prime Minister says, the States have requested it, that is not consonant with the attitude expressed by the States recently. I referred last week to the combined statement of the 6 Premiers on Commonwealth and State financial relations. That document is available to honourable members. It points to the fact that if the States did need to raise additional revenue the only courses open to them were resort to regressive indirect taxation. </para>
          <para>To highlight the situation 1 point out what is the totality of taxation in Australia. I quote from one of the numerous documents submitted by the Treasury, that is the &#39;Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin - National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;, which was published in December 1969. That shows that for the year 1969-70 the est mated total amount of taxation that will be collected in Australia at all levels of taxation - Commonwealth, State, local authority together with another item that is not often noted, the surplus on public authorities - will be $7,602m. Those bodies such as State electricity commissions and gas and fuel corporations or whatever they are called in the various States, charge more for their services than those services cost. This appears as a surplus in the books of public authorities. In addition to the total amount of taxation collected at those 3 levels, these receipts charged for services in excess of what those services cost, will amount to $1,343m. That makes the total of receipts by all public authorities - Commonwealth, State, local, semi-governmental and public utility- S8.945m. </para>
          <para>Indirect taxes, the category into which the present proposal will fall, will yield $3,376m which, is understandable terms, is between 12% and 13% of the gross national product. Income taxes on companies will yield $l,173m, income taxes on persons will yield $2,840m, and estate and gift duties will yield $2 13m. When one looks at the separate pattern of the States and local authorities one finds that virtually all the taxes which the States raise are in the category of indirect taxes. According to the latest information I have, taxes imposed directly by the States amount to $800m. Those imposed by local authorities are in excess of $300m. At least a sum of $70m, which is what the Treasurer suggests will be yielded by this tax, is significant enough as related to the total revenue on which the States rely. That is in the region of 10% of the revenue that they collect themselves. Such a tax is regressive and as a flat level of tax is unfair. It is of the crudest type. There is a lot of discussion these days in some other enlightened countries about what is called a value added tax, but at least value added means the difference between the income received and what it costs to earn that income. But in this case it is levied in total on the turnover, irrespective of what the ratio of expenses to turnover is. To my mind that is the harshest and most regressive form in which this tax will impact on sections unable to defend themselves and being justified, presumably, by the action of this Government and the opinion of the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>The other day I received an issue of the Manufacturers Bulletin* published by the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales. That publication deals with what are called rural factory costs. It says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Country firms in New South Wales have estimated that the overall disadvantage of a country factory location is about 1% on sales, according to a Government survey released last night by the Minister for Decentralisation and Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> B. Fulton. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cite that as an example of one of the disadvantages suffered by those who want the cities to become less agglomerate and the towns to be more populated. At least this measure that is before us is going one-tenth of the way to worsening that situation and if, as I am told, we take into relationship the totality of turnover in relation to expenses of course the impact is much higher still. I think we have all received the communication from that energetic firm in Queensland known as Tickle Holdings Pty Ltd. The letter, I understand, was sent to every member of this House because the tax will be imposed far more heavily in Queensland than previously because Queensland had only a limited sort of receipts duty tax, which I am told was about one-fifth crf the level prevailing in some of the other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr C.</inline> G. Tickle, the  Chairman  of Directors, mentions - apparently with approval - the statement by the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron),</inline> who comes from the State of Queensland, that this i&#171; committing piracy at the expense of Queenslanders. 1 will be interested to hear what some of the other Queenslanders have to think about this act of piracy. </para>
          <para>We heard a lot the other night about hijacking aeroplanes. At least that sort of piracy has not yet occurred in Australia but apparently a different act of piracy is being perpetrated in this country by this obnoxious sort of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tickle</inline> goes on to indicate that the impact of the tax in the case of Queensland means increasing it - according to his figures - by something like 744%. He gives the example of a present duty of 48c in tha! State which under the new arrangements will rise to $4.05. He has done the necessary arithmetic to show that this is 744% greater. Perhaps that may be an extreme example, but nevertheless J do not think there can be any argument but that that tax is a crude form of raising revenues. 1 was rather astonished at an explanation the Treasurer gave in his speech that he thought that what was being done was helping to restrain inflation. It would seem by that sort of logic that if he made the tax 5 times as great he might entirely solve his problem of inflation, but to carry that sort of argument to that degree shows how absurd it is. </para>
          <para>There are some other people who think that you control inflation by the rationing of the purse. The attitude on our side is that when you take this sort of measure the people who are penalised are the people who least deserve to be penalised because it operates in this crude way. It seems that the tax is not to be imposed on wages any longer. I suppose that is some improvement. Let me refer to an answer which the Premier of Victoria gave in the State Parliament on 3rd March 1970 to the  Deputy  Leader of the Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilkes,</inline> of Northcote, who had asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Will the Premier and Treasurer advise the House what is the actual position in relation to the 1 cent in $10- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Which is the impact of it - on wages and salaries and whether Victorians are still obliged to pay the lax? </para>
          <para class="block">This is the answer that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte gave: ) thank the honourable member for his question. The position is as it has been during the past 3 or 4 years, that until the relevant Act is repealed, on a date to be proclaimed, it is a legitimate tax. In fact, it is rather strange that, according to the High Court, this is about the only portion of the Act that is valid - and the part relating to payment on services. However, I have indicated that the Government proposes to repeal this section of the Act. This will be done shortly, bill the Act *ill still operate until the date on which the amendment is proclaimed, which obviously will be the 30th June. 1 presume he means 30th June 1970. Whilst it is not said in the legislation that the Treasurer or the Prime Minister has similar assurances from other States that they intend to do this, the taxing of wages is specifically excluded, but I merely point out that it is still - according to the High Court of Australia - competent for the State to impose the tax in terms of wages and services. I would like to have some assurance that the Treasurer has an assurance from all the States that this obnoxious form of taxation will not be imposed in a flat way on wages, which is the case legally in Victoria at the moment and this will prevail, apparently, until 30th June 1970. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is not unmindful of the difficulties that face the Slates financially and we have suggested that there ought to be a much more considerate treatment of the States than has been the case. We point out that the formula for reimbursement comes up for review in any case after 30th June 1970. If the States are in any immediate difficulty as far as their own works and services are concerned for the remainder of th s financial year - which is a matter of only about 3 weeks - the Commonwealth should pay them such emergency sums as are necessary to carry on pending a complete revision of that formula and, T hope, as soon as is possible a complete rewriting of the taxation structure of Australia which has become ossified. If the honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay),</inline> who is interjecting, reads this document he will see that the States have no love for this resort to indirect taxes. The States say that because the Commonwealth does not treat them adequately they have no other recourse. </para>

              <para>- Our policy is that we believe in the continuance of uniform taxation. We believe that in a federal system an income tax is most easily and most equitably applied at one level; mat it does not lend itself to division according to the different levels of the federation because of the disparity in respect of resources; and that it is part of the job of a federal mechanism to equal se the differences. But that tax structure has been allowed to continue unaltered, and if the honourable member will read the article that I cited last night but which I did not have time to develop further because of the lateness of the hour - the article in the last issue of the &#39;Australian Economic Review&#39; - he will find that because wages are estimated to rise by something like 13% this year there will automatically be an increase of weekly tax deductions of over 17% going automatically into the Commonwealth coffers. Some people are predicting, on the basis of an analysis of the Treasury figures to the end of May by comparison with the same period 12 months ago, that it is likely that there will be an excess of Commonwealth revenue th:s year of at least $70m over what was estimated when the Budget was written, and that therefore the Commonwealth is in a position at this stage, pending the review of the financial arrangements, to pay to the States sufficient to compensate them for what they would collect by this rather dubious and devious method of taxation. </para>

I am nol suggesting that $70m may be all that the States require but at least in respect of these measures they have said that, throughout the 6 States, we will collect $70m by this rather unjust method of taxation, and rather than add any worse tax to an already bad system consideration should be given early to rewriting the whole tax structure in Australia. It cannot be deferred indefinitely on the bas:s that the time is not ripe. Virtually what we are doing in Australia is using the taxation system to get out of some of the difficulties of inflation, which is occurring because we are not grappling properly with other problems. The victims of this kind of system are the people least able to bear it, particularly those on what are called lower and middle incomes - and the term middle&#39; is perhaps a little wide - and especially where the family is a married unit with children and where the wife is unable or unwilling to work. 1 am not one who believes that a home with young children is better because the children are put in a creche or somewhere else. </para>

          <para>If people want to work, fair enough; but many people in this circumstance are unable to work because they place the care of their children above what they might gain as a wage. They are the people who are most harshly hurt by the burdens of direct and indirect taxation. I simply ask any honourable member here a question. We talk about the average weekly wage. If he were getting $72 a week and had a wife and several children to keep, would he think that he would have much surplus left over and that he had not been affected when automatically, as he got a wage increase, a large part of it would simply be taken back into the tax system, and as interest rates rose he would pay higher for durables? </para>

              <para>- Such people will be affected. The total turnover of a greengrocer, for example, will be taxed under this dubious procedure - not his net income but his total turnover. Surely to goodness this is a simple lesson in economics which the gentleman from Queensland in his letter tried to point out. I am not saying it will be passed on. He says that he does nol believe that it can be other than passed on, and if it is passed on, to whom is it passed on? Who arc the greatest customers of the grocers, greengrocers, butchers and bakers in Australia? Surely this is according to the size of the family unit. Like me, the honourable member has more han 2 mouths to feed. The inequity of this system is that it passes on this kind of regressive system of taxation. The Government may, some day, like to review the total structure of tax in Australia and build into it this rather complicated system of value-added tax which some people advocate - and it is more complicated to impose than those who seem to justify it elsewhere claim. But until the Government begins to look at the whole structure of taxation in Australia, particularly the income tax, it certainly should not add further to the pattern of unfair indirect taxes. </para>

          <para>I think, i have made all the points J wanted to make. This is a constitutional contrivance to get around an adverse decision of the court. Whilst the tax purports to be imposed for the States it arises out of the dire financial circumstances of the States. It adds to the pattern of indirect taxation in Australia. The Government should be reviewing the relationships of the Commonwealth and the States within the next few months, but pending that review the Government should tide the States over by paying to them such emergency amounts as they justify. In conclusion 1 read again the amendment, which is as follows: </para>

            <para>- The Labor Party&#39;s shadow treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> has made a characteristic argument upon this measure.  His  argument fell into various categories and I should like to deal with them one by one. He is concerned, of course, with the nature of this tax, as are most people. But following that proposition he was then concerned with the position of the States within the Federation, and it was at this stage that we saw those well known and well generated crocodile tears streaming down the pages as he read. Finally he was concerned with the effects of this tax and its imposition upon any subsequent decisions at a Premiers&#39; Conference. I hope to deal with these during the course of my comments upon the Bill. lt is common knowledge that this measure has arisen out of the problem concerning the Hamersley case and the excise issue which was decided by the High Court. It is pertinent to say that in this matter the High Court - and this may be applicable to other measures which are proposed - has, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte, not been very favourable to the States. That situation having developed it has been found necessary to impose this type of tax. But it ought to be remembered always, I suggest, that this tax is proposed at the suggestion - at the request - of the various States to meet their requirements. This has been made so perfectly clear. The Treasurer in his second reading speech - and nothing in this Bill can be examined without bearing this in mind - had this to say: </para>

It would be appropriate for me for a few moments to ask: Why does he want this measure not passed? Why does he want this source of revenue desired by the States within the Australian framework to be refused to them? We can merely come to a sordid analys&#39;s of politics and ask ourselves: What has been the position concerning other leaders of his own party in relation to this measure? </para>
          <para>If I might divert for one or two moments from the economics of the Bill to the politics and the matters which have inspired this amendment, I ask myself: What has been the attitude of those leaders of the Party opposite in the various States who have some responsibility? It is worth bearing in mind that the Leader of the Opposition, in a Press statement, and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> have been very concerned about the position in Queensland. I ask them then: Why do they not bear in relation to this Bill as responsible an attitude as was borne by the Leader of the Opposition in </para>
          <para class="block">Queensland and the shadow Treasurer in Queensland who are very well known and respected members of his own Party?

          <para class="block">They are very pertinent and rather appropriate statements. There does seem to be developing rather a gap between their attitude on these matters and the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, similar measures to this have applied in other States of the Commonwealth. Similar measures have applied for some time in Tasmania. A Bill in that State imposing similar rates although different in some legal aspects - the High Court judgment had not been given - was passed in late 1968. The Leader of the Opposition is going outside to check. I can assure him that my quotes are perfectly correct. In Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reece,</inline> who was the leader of the State Government at the time and in the past a member of the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party, imposed substantially the ingredients in this Bill - a receipts tax - in 1968.

          <para class="block">Therefore, if the tax was not to be introduced there were to be cutbacks in certain Government and public services including social services. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition had received some advice about this matter. He thought he would get around this. He obviously had consulted with the honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Duthie).</inline> The honourable member for Wilmot said a moment ago by way of interjection: &#39;Oh look, you cannot blame us. The Grants Commission made us do it.&#39; This was almost what he said. 1 presume he said that but if he did not he should have. The fact is that when a tax is imposed in a State and when grants are being given to a State a comparison is made between Tasmania and the standard States. It means that if a tax of this nature is being imposed in New South Wales and Victoria a tax appropriate to Tasmania&#39;s capacity ought to be imposed there. We know from an examination of the Grants Commission&#39;s reports that Tasmania does not have the capacity to pay taxes per capita at the same rates as apply in the standard States. So if Tasmania had wanted to impose a tax on the advice of the Grants Commission similar in burden to that which operated, and which was proposed to be operated, in the standard States the tax would have been substantially lower than that which the Labor Premier of Tasmania proposed at the time. That should be very clear to the honourable member for Wilmot and the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>Let me amplify that point a little. We know, for example, that the indices of taxable capacity in Tasmania compared with the standard States range between 60% and 70%. We know that if a tax of lc in $10 applies in the standard States, the burden placed upon the people of Tasmania ought to be something like 0.7c in $10 or 7c in $100. No, the Tasmanian Premier saw that this tax was necessary. </para>
          <para class="block">He saw it was necessary for the maintenance of the level of services in his own Slate and he applied the tax at the higher rate. So, for 2 reasons, as we know from the Premier&#39;s own words and from his own calculations, he applied this tax. This merely indicates the gap that has developed between those who are perpetually in Opposition and those who from time to time have some responsibility in terms of revenue and taxation, lt is not for me to flee from the politics of this measure so I intend to go a little further. </para>
          <para>In Western Australia a tax similar to this type has applied for many years, but to a narrower range. No Labor leader in Western Australia has said that he would repeal it. This tax even applies in Victoria. Lei us look at what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Holding, a great friend of the Leader of the Opposition, had to say. The Leader of the Opposition is presumed to have helped <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding</inline> at the last State election in Victoria.

Nevertheless, the Leader of the Opposition helped to get the vote to 41%. What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Holding say about this tax when he introduced his own fiscal policy during the State election campaign in Victoria only weeks ago? All he did was to complain that a tax had been imposed some years before and that he would never give a guarantee that he would repeal that tax. </para>

              <para>wish to look now at some of the economic effects of this tax. Much of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said is perfectly correct. This is not the kind of tax one would like, lt is what is known in other terms as a cascading tax. It is a cumulative tax and it can rise quite sharply. If the tax was of a very significant size, the tax could then not be put. But it must be borne in mind that this tax is at a very low rate. Even though it is cascading and even though it is cumulative, its effects are not nearly as great as some of those who have written about it have indicated. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>We must bear in mind, nevertheless, that this tax has been brought into being against the background of recent Premiers&#39; Conferences and against the background of requests by the Premiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin,</inline> Sit Henry Bolte, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> and others have agreed that the tax should bc introduced. If it is desired that a tax of this nature not exist, the only solution would be to give back a proportion of income taxation powers to the States, lt is perfectly clear from recent conferences that Premiers do not want back income taxation powers. Were I in a position to take acton. I would endeavour to make the Premiers take back a proportion of the taxation powers and give to them some responsibility for the money which they do spend. But the Opposition does not even approach that problem. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports does not even consider that kind of solution. The Opposition would never support that kind of solution. </para>
          <para>It is wrong to say also that the totality of income taxation has to be retained by the Commonwealth in order to iron out fiscal fluctuations. Income taxation rates and alterations in those rates have been used to iron out fiscal fluctuations in the Australian economy once or perhaps twice - that is all - in the last 20-ocld years, lt has not been done significantly since 1962 to iron out proposed economic fluctuations, and it was done once during the 1950s. There could always be argument about this but the essential point. I think, that has to be taken care of is that the retention of complete income taxation powers by the Commonwealth is not necessary and those powers have nol been used to iron out economic fluctuations. 1 would suggest, still, that a degree of these powers could be returned to the States and should be returned. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Melbourne Ports complained concerning the regressive nature of this tax. ft does not bear a relation to work done. It does not bear, always in its totality, a relation to the value of goods which change hands - that is, after a lot of processes. It does not bear much of social value which ought to be supported. But let us put this into perspective. The Commonwealth has been forced into this position. The burden of the tax is considerably less than is suggested in a letter which has been circulated to honourable members by Tickle Holdings Pty Ltd, a Queensland firm. I was disappointed to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports quote some of the details in that letter of approval. They are just grossly inaccurate. Let me illustrate this one or two ways. The letter, which has been given wide circulation and on which the Leader of the Opposition hopes to build a campaign, says:   . . the effect of the higher rate on consumer prices in Queensland will largely depend on the extent to which businesses absorb the inc reuse in duly or pass it on in the form of increased prices. </para>
          <para class="block">At the end of the letter there is a calculation showing that, on the original supply of materials to a manufacturer of a \ulue of $600, the increased amount of taxation paid at the retail level would be approximately $4. But those who have made this calculation have forgotten that these days an essential of retail enterprise is that so often there is no wholesaler or agents but direct contact between manufacturers and retailers. That is the trend in this kind of activity. So. the lawful increase in the toality of the tax is considerably less than has been made out in this calculation. lt is suggested also that thi.s tax will cause inflation in Queensland. The tax was not responsible for inflation in Western Australia. After the rates were varied there Western Australia was not subject to inflation. After the rates were varied, within a reasonable time it was not inflation that worried Victoria. After the rates were varied, it was not inflation that worried South Australia. After the rales wire varied - although this was a little later- -it was not inflation that worried the other States, including Tasmania. So. insofar as inflation occurs as a result of this tax. the inflation has to have some relation to the increase in prices resulting from this tax. The experience in the other States is as I have indicated. If it is said that inflation occurs in Queensland as a result of the introduction of this tax, the imposition of the tax is being used more as an excuse than as an explanation of reality. But, further, insofar as the tax exists already in highly industrialised processing and manufacturing States - I refer to New South Wales and Victoria - it has a feedback effect on the State that is affected most seriously by this measure - Queensland. That feed back effect operates already in some States. So the letter that has been produced by these people is wrong both in :a economic analysis and in some of the simple calculations on which the analysis is based. </para>
          <para>There are other matters concerning this measure which warrant some analysis and it is not possible to go through all of them. But I would like to mention one or two points which have some significance. The tax does mean greatly increased revenue for some States. It can mean an amount of increased revenue when it is taken with the receipts duties already operating in New South Wales. I am talking now about the blurring of the edges between excise and non-excise tax. It is said it can be worth something in the nature of $3 Om a year to New South Wales, $25m a year to Victoria, $6m a year to South Australia and $6m a year to Western Australia. What it is worth in my own State is rather difficult to calculate but to those who say there is a financial surplus of $70m available to the Commonwealth which should be distributed in this way I would suggest, as I do to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> that they have made a very superficial analysis which, in the case of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, does not become him. A much more profound study of the present economic position in Australia is required. </para>
          <para>When one looks through the levels of returns which are available to States one thing docs stand out and 1 think it is worth commenting upon. The levels or return available in New South Wales and Victoria are very high compared with the returns in the other States. Of the total amount which will be returned in this taxation, those States will gain a disproportionately high amount. Why? They will gain a disproportionately high amount because from the nature of their industry it is clear that it is valuable to them. They have sufficient feed back processes; they have sufficient numbers of changes of goods to be worth a lot to them; they have sufficient specialised industries which enable a high rate of tax to be returned to the States. The States which do not have this kind of industrial structure will have, even at the same rate of tax, a lower amount of money returned to them. If a State has a large proportion of its activity directed to direct export activities and if it does not go through many hands - one can think, of course, of the great mineral States, the States from which the great exports are generated within the Commonwealth - there are fewer interchanges of goods and there are fewer chances to levy a tax of this nature. This means that the return to such a State, granted that the goods are f.o.b., would be significantly less than to States with a different structure. </para>
          <para>This point leads up to the coming Premier&#39;s Conference. This conference will consider a new taxation formula for redistribution of resources between the States. The Opposition has never proposed significant alterations in this formula. They complain about finance. They complain about the position of States within the Commonwealth but they have never made one proposition. Bearing in mind the nature of this taxation, 2 aspects of it are significant. The burden of taxation varies in States according to the development of the States and the capacity of States to pay taxation varies according to similar measures. These should be taken into account in any new taxation formula. For example, the present formula takes account of 2 factors mainly - the rate of increase in salaries and the rate of increase in population. There are some others that should be considered and I suggest that these be examined. </para>
          <para>The other characteristics that should be considered in the formula are the differential effects, for example, of tariff protection in highly industrialised States compared with others in terms of the standards to be achieved, and the different multiplier effects of money spent in those States compared with others. These characteristics have both been ignored. With reference to the second characteristic, I go to an article published in the &#39;Economic Record&#39; of 1964. I would merely suggest this for quick analysis. The article is written by H. A. Brown and is entitled &#39;Australian Interstate Trade and Payments&#39;. This is the kind of analysis which should be considered in Australian interstate finance. Without going into the details of his argument he says on page 372: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Trade payments (assuming, in spite of the portion entered above . . .) show a strong net balance towards the central States. The clearing of bank accounts as between States shows a similar tendency if such accounts were able to be published. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This kind of analysis, which was suggested as long ago as 1964, should be considered by those who are concerned with Australian interstate finance and the position of the States. </para>
          <para>I return to the original thesis which I have made. This legislation has been brought into being at the request of the States. Under the Constitution, this is the only way in which the States can be satisfied. Those who criticised this measure should rationalise certain features of it. </para>
          <para class="block">They are these: If they do not accept it they should make specific proposals for States, which they have never made in the past in any economic context. They should also resolve their differences with the various State leaders who have supported this measure. Finally, in the fields where they do have some responsibility those on the Opposition side who criticise and the Opposition Party that has some responsibility, for example, in local authority affairs, should bear in mind that such local authorities apply normal rates which are much more regressive than this tax and are imposed at the highest level of any local authority in Australia. They should resolve that situation before they suggest a solution to this problem which would lead nowhere. 1 would suggest very kindly that their own sense of regression with respect to taxation would take them out of the situation and out of the economy altogether. </para>

            <para>- The debating points made by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> would deserve more consideration if they were based on facts or if they were advanced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> or the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury).</inline> This Bill and its associated Bills will be rejected by the Parliament. In those circumstances <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holt</inline> would undoubtedly have come into the Parliament immediately after my shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean),</inline> had officially declared my Party&#39;s attitude and stated the Government&#39;s attitude. Furthermore, the Treasurer could have come in at that stage because, while he introduced the Bills, he is entitled to speak to the amendments that my shadow Treasurer has moved. But the present Prime Minister is an indifferent parliamentarian. He fears the House and avoids it. The Treasurer, similarly, apparently cares neither about his programme nor the Parliament&#39;s judgment of it. The facts are these: This tax was first introduced by the Brand Government in Western Australia in 1967. It was opposed by the Labor Party in both Houses of that Parliament. The following year it was introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte and it was opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding.</inline> Last year, under pressure from the Commonwealth, it was introduced in 3 other States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ask.ii</inline> introduced it in New South Wales and it was opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hills.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hall</inline>introduced it and it was opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> in the South Australian Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reece</inline> in Tasmania had to introduce it because the Commonwealth Grants Commission made it plain that if his Government did not take the steps which had already been adopted by the standard States to raise revenue in th s way then the Commission would recommend a corresponding reduction in the Commonwealth&#39;s grants to his State. </para>
          <para>Then, after the Commonwealth announced that it would impose the tax the Queensland Parliament, on a bipartisan basis, introduced it knowing that if th s Bill went through the Parliament Queenslanders would have to pay it in any case. Any Commonwealth tax ie levied equally on all States. So I repeat, the Labor Party has opposed this in all the State Parliaments and my colleagues and I oppose it similarly in both Houses of th:s Parliament. </para>
          <para>This Bill provides the first real opportunity the Parliament has had to reverse the progressive degeneration of Federal finances. Since the election last October the Government time and time again has displayed complete inability satisfactorily to resolve the complaints of the State governments and a complete refusal even to consider those of local government. There is only one forum in the land which can judge the Government&#39;s failure in this respect and that is the national electorate, which the Government at all costs will avoid. This Bill is the latest example of a process of buck-passing between the Commonwealth and the States which is eroding the foundations of democratic responsibility. For years we witnessed the buck-passing process in which the Commonwealth passes the administrative buck to the States and the States pass the financial buck to the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>In his second reading speech the Treasurer repeatedly referred to the fact that the Bill was introduced at the request of the States. In his Press statement 2 days ago the Prime Minister reiterated this and asserted that the Australian Labor Party&#39;s quarrel is with the State governments and not with the Commonwealth Government. 1 challenge the Prime Minister to deny that his Government :s responsible to this Parliament and to the people of Australia for any Bill which it sponsors irrespective of who requests it. If he does deny that - and it is the basic assumption of his Press statement - then honourable members will clearly see the degree to which the continuing story of Commonwealth-State conflict under 7 Liberal  Treasurers over the last 2 years has damaged the basis of parliamentary democracy. </para>
          <para>Further, I challenge the Government&#39;s assertion that this measure really was introduced at the request of the States. When the crisis first arose last September the Prime Minister indicated only that the Commonwealth would ensure that the States would not lose revenue should the receipts duty be held invalid. We support that attitude, as my colleague&#39;s amendment which I have seconded, shows. It was not until 18th November that the Commonwealth stated it would impose a similar tax and even then its currency was only for the financial year - to the end of this month. Eventually, at the Premiers Conference on 26th February, when the proposals which the Premiers jointly believed to be appropriate had been summarily dismissed by the Prime Minister, this tax emerged with an indefinite life. </para>
          <para>The possibility that the Commonwealth should impose this tax on behalf of the States was first suggested on 18th September last by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bethune,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Brand expressed opposition to the suggestion. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Commonwealth control of receipt duty would only perpetuate the problems of the States in having to approach the Commonwealth repeatedly for more revenue. What little flexibility the States now had with the receipts duty would disappear. If the States or even a particular State wanted to increase or decrease the rate of duty, the Commonwealth would have to agree. The matter would then become a political battle. </para>

            <para>My Government and I have never been wedded to the idea of a receipts tax. We were driven into it so that we might meet our commitments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>This tax has never been justified in any other terms but that it was a mechanism for providing the States with a growth tax which they could control. The sole basis for justification, in terms of State sovereignty, has been swept aside by the High Court. It has never been justified in any other terms, nor could it be. Its entire rationale has been destroyed and now this Government introduces a Bill which would make the States even more dependent on the Commonwealth, as is clearly seen by the necessity to increase the duty in Queensland to 5 times what it was and over a much greater range of goods. It is an unjust, cumbersome and regressive form of taxation. It must be clear to all concerned that once the States have lost the right to set their own rates, decide their own criteria of liability and allow for their own policy judgments with respect to exemptions from liability, the States are interested only in receiving a certain sum of money which grows each year. We on this side of the House believe that this objective can be completely fulfilled by certain marginal adjustments in more equitable forms of revenue raising. The only reason why the Government has rejected this alternative is that it would be more directly responsible to the people of Australia for such an action. </para>
          <para>The principal characteristic of this tax defies every principle of equity and efficiency. Its imposition has arbitrary multiplicative effects according to the accident of the number of transactions through which goods and services pass. It is indirect tax and therefore regressive. Its incidence is totally unrelated to the capacity of the individual to pay. Let there be no doubt that it would be passed on in the form of higher prices. It is not related even to ability to pay in a purely commercial sense for, in relation to a particular business enterprise, it must be paid whether a profit is made or not. It falls most heavily on businesses which happen to have a low profit turnover ratio. A further limitation of this form of taxation is that it has uncertain and arbitrary effects on the efficient allocation of resources. Its incidence can be aggravated or relieved by quite accidental business arrangements. It falls most heavily on those which involve a large number of inter-firm transactions and on those which rely on extensive use of sub-contractors, as in the housing industry. </para>
          <para>A  tax on the number of times that money changes hands can have a severe and unpredictable impact on the velocity of circulation of money, which economists agree is a key economic variable, ft acts as an incentive to mergers and take-over bids so that economic transactions can occur within a particular firm. This effect is totally unrelated to the efficient use of resources. It adds a further incentive for the development of restrictive trade practices and monopolistic industries for they can more readily pass the lax on to consumers, whereas small businessmen and primary producers cannot. </para>
          <para>It is exceptionally expensive tax to collect. Thus the experience of State stamp duties offices indicates that the expenditure on administration would increase by 80% within a few years after its introduction. Figures can be deduced from only 4 States. These figures show that the estimated expenditure for stamp duties offices for this year exceed their 1966-67 actual expenditures by 39% in both New South Wales and Queensland, 77% in Victoria and 83% in Western Australia, lt is impossible to get complete figures on what it will cost to collect the receipts duty but a fairly conservative estimate would be that it is greater than S2m a year. This is approximately 3% to 4% of the revenue collected. The cost of collecting other forms of Commonwealth revenue is only 1%. </para>
          <para>Further, it is an exceptionally expensive form of taxation with which to comply. This has been the constant complaint of businesses throughout Australia. If this Bill is passed these difficulties will be perpetuated. The adjustments required in terms of bookkeeping and business procedures are unjustified. This is similarly true of the complex legal advice which businesses would have to receive in order to achieve satisfactory compliance with the ambiguities and vague provisions of this Bill. </para>
          <para>The origins of this legislation lie in the High Court&#39;s decision that a receipts duty can be an excise or customs duty in terms of section 90 of the Constitution, which makes the right to levy such duties exclusive to the Commonwealth. This invalidated part of the field covered by the Slates&#39; Acts. The Bills before the House impose a Commonwealth tax on all business receipts, not just those which were declared invalid by the High Court. This is indicated clearly in the 3 Bills which impose a rate of duty. The Stales Receipts Duty Bill (No. 1) and the Slates Receipts Duty Bill (No. 2) impose a duty of excise and of customs respectively. These 2 Bills cover the entire field to which section 90 applies and therefore the field to which the High Court decision relates. Yet there is a third Bill which imposes a duty to the extent that it is not a duty of excise or customs. Now, why has the Commonwealth taken this step? Why has it imposed taxation beyond the area declared invalid by the High Court? At no point in the Treasurer&#39;s second reading speech is this fact acknowledged. He gives no explanation of why this extension was regarded as desirable. </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>the most onerous and widespread effect of this Bill would be in Queensland, where the old State Act completely exempted all overthecounter retail sales. These would now be subject to duty. At a time when the Treasurer continues to pontificate about the problems of inflation, he introduces a measure which will significantly increase the prices of Queensland consumer goods. The Treasurer asserts that Queenslanders who have paid duty at the old rate will be exempted by section 88 from paying the increased tax, but can the Commonwealth allow a tax deduction which has the effect of making the residents of one State pay less than those of another? The Government itself clearly has doubts, because sub-section (5) contains a severability clause, the only one in the Act. If the Government&#39;s own doubts prove valid, Queenslanders will have to pay extra duty on ali receipts since November, not just in the future. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the States as a whole, people in some cases who were subject to duty no longer are, and there are some who were not subject to duty and now will be. To take the first case, it is clear that the Commonwealth has attempted to aggregate the entire list of State exemptions but in no previous State was an &#39;unlicensed club&#39; or the sale of gold bullion completely exempt. Some States did not exempt credit unions, and some did not exempt building societies and trade unions. On the other hand, there are persons previously exempt from duty who will now have to pay. Thus, in Queensland all over-the-counter retail sales were exempt, as were all payments of less than $20. </para>
          <para>If we turn to the schedule of exemptions in the Bill before this House, we will note in exemption 28 (c) that refunds of rates paid to local government bodies will be exempt. However, under the State Acts in Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia, not only were refunds of rates exempt but all overpaid taxes and duties were similarly exempt. Are we to understand that under this new Commonwealth legislation refunds of overpaid taxes as distinct from rates will now be subject to duty? There are other cases which are no longer exempt. In New South Wales prizes on poker machines were exempt. The difficulties associated with a legal interpretation of &#39;the course of carrying on a business&#39; under the Companies Acts are well known. It may very well be that clubs in New South Wales will be held to be carrying on such a business. Another exemption in the New South Wales legislation was a receipt for money paid for a call in respect of the share capital of a mining company. That is not in this Bill. In the Tasmanian Act payments to a manufacturer of butter or cheese upon the resale by him of butter or cheese that he had purchased from the Australian Dairy Produce Board were also exempt. Will they be now? What will eventually be the scope of Exemption No. 2 under which regulations can be made to impose duties on public authorities? What will be the scope of these regulations? Will they in fact cover those public authorities exempted specifically under State Acts? Thus, in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, public hospitals are specifically exempted, and also in New South Wales payments by the Pastures Protection Board. Will they now be exempt? </para>
          <para>Exemption 14(c) exempts receipts associated with securities issued by any public authority, but regulations can be made which withdraw this exemption from a public authority. Under the legislation in Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales no such provision for withdrawing this exemption is included. It is quite clear that making this measure retrospective will breed a multitude of anomalies that can never be satisfactorily resolved. </para>
          <para>I am somewhat disturbed by the press statement that the Prime Minister issued in response to the Labor Party&#39;s challenge. The initial undertaking by the Commonwealth was that it would compensate the States for any loss of revenue which would result from the invalidation of the States&#39; Acts, lt was only later that the specific technique of imposing a similar tax was adopted. The only possible implication of the Prime Minister&#39;s reaction to our challenge is that it is his intention to dishonour this initial obligation in precisely the same way that he dishonoured the obligations to consult on the off-shore legislation. He denies that the rejection of this Bill will affect the Commonwealth Government. The implication in that statement is that, should this measure be defeated, he will refuse to honour his initial undertaking to make up the loss of revenue from other sources. </para>
          <para>We on this side of the House object to the nature of this form of taxation. We do, however, believe that the Commonwealth should fulfil its undertaking to compensate the States for the loss of revenue brought about by the High Court&#39;s decision. I ask the Prime Minister to state categorically that the Commonwealth&#39;s initial undertaking still stands, even if this particular form of meeting the obligation is to be defeated. </para>
          <para>In his second reading speech the Treasurer asserted that, if the receipts tax was not continued, this would aggravate inflationary pressures in the economy. This is the last of a long series of confused utterances by him on the state of the economy which we have experienced this year. We have become accustomed to hearing the Treasurer complain about the effects of increased wages on prices or what economists would call &#39;cost push inflation&#39;. Now he seeks to explain inflation in terms of excessive demand. At no stage has the Treasurer attempted to develop a consistent and fully explained basis for his comments on inflationary tendencies, potential or otherwise. What would be the inflationary effects of the abolition of receipts duties in the short term? We would have to set off the extra amounts which would have to be paid in company tax and personal income tax. This would be of the order of SI 5m to </para>
          <para class="block">S20m. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether there would be any impact of an immediate nature. In none of his statements about economic portents has the Treasurer even acknowledged the fact that there are lags in the adjustment of the economy to new measures. The major part of the receipts duties has already been paid, and there would undoubtedly be delays in the return of this money should this Parliament take a firm stand. There would be further lags before this revenue would be reflected in further expenditure. Should the Commonwealth be unwilling to use its antiinflationary tools in the interim, it would appear that no significant inflationary processes would occur before the Commonwealth could adjust to them in its Budget. </para>
          <para>There is only one issue before this Parliament at the present time. It is not whether the Stales should be compensated for the revenue they have lost due to the High Court action. That is accepted. The only question is in what way the Commonwealth should compensate. That is a Commonwealth decision for which this Government must bear full responsibility. We on this side do not believe that the receipts tax is the appropriate mechanism, lt is a regressive form of taxation; it has incalculable harmful effects on the efficient allocation of resources; it is expensive to collect: it imposes unnecessary burdens for businesses which have to adjust their administrative procedures in order to comply. The Government has not explained at any stage why it has chosen to implement this tax rather than adjusting in a marginal way one of the established forms of Commonwealth taxation. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister asserts that the tax was implemented at the request of the States. This is a complete distortion of the facts. There is no doubt that the previous Treasurer encouraged the States to either follow the Western Australian model or impose a tax of a similar nature on turnover. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Francis</inline> Nicklin, the ex-Premier of Queensland, publicly accused the exTreasurer of this. Every Premier at the time that his State Government adopted this form of taxation apologised for it and blamed the Commonwealth -for the necessity of its introduction. The initial reaction of several Premiers to the suggestion that the Commonwealth impose such a tax was hostile, lt is quite clear that the only reason why this &#39;request&#39; was ever made was that the Commonwealth made it clear that it would refuse to compensate the States by increasing its own existing forms of taxation. This was a stratagem to attempt to evade Commonwealth responsibility for the Bill before the House. None of the States except Western Australia would have introduced this Bill but for Commonwealth pressure on their finances and the Commonwealth&#39;s urging them to follow Western Australia&#39;s example. This basic choice always existed, and the fact that the Government has chosen to introduce this new form of Commonwealth taxation indicates that it cannot evade its responsibility, despite the posturings of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister&#39;s assertion that the rejection of this measure does not affect the Commonwealth has no substance in logic or fact. If the Commonwealth is to honour its promise to compensate the States for the loss of revenue, then such a rejection must affect the Commonwealth. This measure represents the last in a series of superficial ad hoc adjustments to a basic problem. The Labor Party believes that the crisis which would be caused by such a rejection should lead to a long term solution. Any government which is defeated by the Parliament on a major taxation Bill should resign. The sooner this Government resigns the sooner the people can elect a government which can make a reasonable financial agreement with the States and can take into account the still more severe financial situation of the State&#39;s creations - their local government and semigovernment authorities . </para>
          <para>For the last 2 years throughout the lifelime of the Gorton Government there have been 7 Liberal Treasurers in Australia. Never has there been such a crisis, since the depression, in Commonwealth-State financial relations. Accordingly, the Liberals clearly cannot solve this problem - they will not even tackle it. On this measure they are blaming the States - the States which had to impose this tax because the former Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> urged them to do so. He held out to them that this was the source of revenue which was available to them.  His  legal judgment was astray, and now the Commonwealth has undertaken, quite properly, to compensate the States for the loss of revenue which they have suffered through the High Court&#39;s invalidating of the legislation which the Commonwealth urged the States to adopt. Certainly the Commonwealth should compensate the States, but not in this cumbersome, regressive form. </para>
          <para>This Bill will be defeated in another place. The Government should then resign. It has become quite clear in the months since the last Federal election that this Government is pathologically incapable of resolving the problems of Commonwealth-State-civic financial relations. </para>

          <para>- Yes. The honourable member for Barton suggested that I should have been on the other side of the House during the division. The point is that I sat here until 3.30 this morning waiting to speak on this Bill and that I sat here all this morning when the House resumed and until 12 minutes past 2, but unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition spoke until the time allotted for the debate had expired and did not give me an opportunity to speak. </para>

              <para>- This report relates to the Australian Dairy Produce Board, the Canberra Community Hospital, the National Library of Australia and the Superannuation Board, in respect of matters arising from the Supplementary Report of the Auditor-General for 1968-69. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Our inquiry into the Australian Dairy Produce Board arose from the failure of the Board to complete its financial statements in time for their inclusion in the Auditor-General&#39;s Supplementary Report. The evidence shows that the main cause of this failure related to an amount of $97,743 which the Board decided late in 1968-69 to charge against the Dairying industry Stabilisation Fund to cover administration costs incurred in that year in. earning income from its South East Asian projects. Your Committee believes that the Board should have given attention to this matter when income from those projects began to appear in 1967-68. We also believe that the Department of Primary Industry should have sought a legal opinion in June 1969 on the question of whether ministerial approval was required to give effect to the Board&#39;s decision. This would have obviated the need for such an opinion to be sought much later by the AuditorGeneral&#39;s office. However, your Committee would commend the Dairy Produce Board for consulting with the Public Service Board regarding the use of electronic data processing equipment in an effort to improve the speed of its account preparation and to improve management. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Canberra Community Hospital we noted that sundry debtors for patient fees had increased from about $425,000 in May 1968 to more than $531,600 in June 1969. The evidence shows that this increase had arisen mainly from fee increases that occurred during the year and an increase in the number of inpatients. Moreover, a new procedure introduced in June 1968 for benefit assignment or payment of account on discharge from the Hospital resulted in an increase in the number of accounts referred to the hospital funds in 1968-69. Arising from the evidence your Committee believes that the Hospital must maintain a continuing surveillance of its outstanding debts and its methods of debt recovery. We also believe that Commonwealth departments should settle promptly all hospital accounts with which they are concerned. </para>
          <para>Our inquiry into the National Library of Australia related to the stocktaking of the Library&#39;s assets, which stocktaking has been of a composite nature in recent years. On the evidence, your Committee believes that, in the past, there has been a need for the introduction of an appropriate stocktaking programme. Following a pilot study made by the library in 1969 and the subsequent creation by the Public Service Board of 13 new positions on the Library&#39;s staff establishment we trust that a suitable stocktaking programme can be implemented without delay. </para>
          <para>While the late presentation of financial statements by the Superannuation Board was occasioned by audit queries that arose when draft statements were submitted for audit, your Committee is particularly concerned by the problems confronting the Board in the preparation of those statements. The evidence shows that since 1966 the Board has issued circulars to departments and authorities concerning the prompt payment of contributions and delays and errors that have occurred in the submission of fortnightly returns. In spite of this, about 30 departments and authorities submitted returns for 1968-69 subsequent to 30th June 1969 and 9 were still outstanding as at 31st July. Also during that year the Board found it necessary to investigate 224 returns from 68 &#39; departments and authorities that failed to reconcile. Your Committee would make it clear that this situation reflects on the administrative performances of the departments and authorities concerned. I commend the report to honourable members, </para>

            <para>- by leave - It is true, as the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> has said, that I did have a conference with the Secretary of the Federated Clerks Union and the Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this issue. Following the discussions a paper was drawn up, which I will read. It will be of interest to honourable members in relation to this debate. I think that almost all honourable member; have received letters from people employed by ASIA expressing their concern about what will be their future when the provisions of this legislation are enacted. Most honourable members have sent those letters to me for my comments. 1 have not had an opportunity to sign replies to those letters yet. Replies have been prepared and they will be going out as soon as 1 can physically put my signature on them. In the meantime 1 will announce the terms of the statement. It states: </para>

            <para>- 1 thank the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> for tabling that report. We knew that he had it and would be making its contents known at some point in lbc debate. I thought it would be appropriate for him to do so at this stage so that honourable members who wished to speak on the Bill would have this information in their possession. The Bill before the House is an amendment to the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act. which was introduced in 1967 and amended in 1.968. This legislation implemented the recommendations of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference - probably better known as the Woodward Committee - which was set up by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gordon Menzies in October 1965, when he was Prime Minister. At that time there was great industrial turmoil on the waterfront. The Waterside Workers Federation and the Federal Government were almost in a head on conflict. Stoppages were the order of the day. In all, the state was reached where work was almost impossible. The waterfront had come to an almost permanent halt, and something had to be done. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As a result of conferences between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government at that dme it was finally resolved that the Conference should be appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr A.</inline> E. Woodward, Q.C. was appointed by the Government as the  Chairman.  The Conference was made up of representatives of the Association of Employers of Waterfront Labour, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Department of Labour and National Service. The Conference mct and deliberated for a considerable time. Finally it submitted a report to the Minister on 13th April 1967. The legislation was introduced in this place on 31st October 1967. With very limited time to study the legislation, the Opposition was required, some 26 or 28 hours later, on 1st November to debate it. lt must be obvious from that very brief summary that I have given of what took place that the legislation on that occasion was hastily thrown together, In 1968 a further amendment was introduced to overcome some of the technical and administrative problems which had not been foreseen on thai occasion. In the Bill before the House at present not only is a change proposed in the general constitution of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority but also an attempt is made to cure some of the problems associated with administration. </para>
          <para>The Bill (hat we are now asked to debate provides for the continuation of permanent employment in the stevedoring industry for an additional 2 years from 1st July 1970 until 30th June 1972. The Bill amends the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority from a 3-man authority io a l-man authority; that is, from a chairman and 2 member&#39;s to  a  director, lt also provides the necessary machinery to establish that position. The Bill grants statutory backing to the National Stevedoring Industry Conference by reconstituting it as the Stevedoring Industry Council. As 1 said a moment ago, the Bill also corrects some of the administrative anomalies that have crept into the legislation. The Opposition supports the legislation but feels that rather than having the Director as the sole member of the authority it should consist of a 3- man directorate, not necessarily as it is at the moment with 3 full time, permanent members, but with a permanent director and 2 part time directors. One should be from the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, and one from the Waterside Workers Federation. Representatives of those 2 organisations could work with the Director, assisting him and advising him on the functions and operations of the Authority. </para>
          <para>The Opposition feels that, with the setting up of the Stevedoring Industry Council, this tripartite principle could be transferred into the operations of the directorship of the Stevedoring Industry Authority. That principle has worked for some considerable time with a chairman and 2 members. Why not retain it but change it to a level where it contains direct representatives of the employer and employee authorities that I have just referred to? We feel that the legislation should have been introduced much earlier. People in the industry have been greatly concerned about what is going to happen to them and their permanent employment. We do not feel that there is any risk of the Government not proceeding with its policy of permanent employment on the waterfront. The general feeling is that the egg has been scrambled and there is not much risk of its being put back together again. </para>
          <para>The legislation having been introduced here in 1967, the Government has had 2 years to determine what it is going to do with it, what its policy is going to be, whether it is going to continue its policy of permanent employment and how it is going to continue with it. Yet at this late hour, with a matter of just a few more weeks to go until the expiry of the existing legislation which terminates on 30th June, we have this Bill brought to us on the basis that it is another piece of temporary legislation for another 2 years. </para>
          <para>I refer to the matter of permanent employment of waterfront labour at ports throughout Australia. I understand that Whyalla is to be granted a system of permanent employment in the very near future and that discussions are taking place at Darwin in regard to this matter. Permanent employment should have been granted to Townsville, Hobart, Burnie and Bundaberg in the last 2 years because they are ready for it. The waterside workers and the employers both want it and therefore it should be proceeded with as early as possible. The Department of Labour and National Service has been a little lax in not having brought this legislation down and had decisions made about the introduction of permanent employment. The stoppages on the waterfront that have occurred in recent months can be explained and justified. The introduction of permanent employment and the establishing of the Stevedoring Industry Council are commendable. The Opposition supports the scheme. It will bring about some degree of stability to the waterfront industry which has been a most turbulent one. History shows that there have always been strikes and trouble on the waterfront. The proposed scheme can bring about some degree of permanency of employment and stability for the men and for the industry. </para>
          <para>The setting up of the Stevedoring Industry Council is an excellent idea. It creates direct participation for the industry. The employer representatives and the union representatives at the highest level of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation will meet regularly to discuss the problems. Previously if a dispute arose ofttimes the men went on strike. The employer would not talk to them and the tribunal would not talk to them because they were on strike. Strikes were imminent. They were certain to take place on certain days. Now we have an organisation which is able to meet, to call the parties together and overcome the problems that are in existence. I should like to see the Stevedoring Industry Council or the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority examine, or, if need be, some separate organisation created to examine and investigate the whole ramifications of the waterfront today, not only on the basis of employment but also on the basis of the organisation of the industry, the provision of machinery, the organising of ports and the development of ports. At the present time in Australia 44 different port authorities conduct their affairs on the basis of the development, construction and provision of wharfage and all the other matters. I should like to see a number of these authorities eliminated or a central authority, such as the Stevedoring Industry Council, created by the Government to do this job. </para>
          <para>In the United States of America there is a New York Port Authority in which 2 States are involved. They were unable to operate individually so they drew up legislation to establish the authority. People talk about the United States as being the great land of free enterprise. Here is a Socialist organisation if ever there was one, the New York Port Authority which conducts all the shipping operations in New York. That Authority conducts airports such as Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark. It is examining the development of Triborough This is all being carried out by a Stateowned instrumentality and if necessary the facilities arc leased out to other people to operate. At Kennedy airport the Authority owns all the facilities. It either makes the land available or constructs the terminals and then leases them out. The same thing applies to the shipping port section; the Authority owns the facilities, builds them and, where necessary, leases them. This is what we should be looking at here in Australia. </para>
          <para>At Tokyo, Kobe. Rotterdam - which is the largest port in the world - and even London, the facilities are either State-owned or are owned by a city council and are operated by government authorities charged with the responsibility of developing the ports. Instead of dealing with employment, wages and so on, the Commonwealth Government should be moving into a much broader field of the stevedoring industry. One can pick up newspapers at different times and find references to the inefficiency of and the poor conditions that prevail in Australian ports. An article in the &#39;Daily Mirror&#39; of 5th May 1970 states: </para>

          <para class="block">Another example is to be found in the Australian Financial Review&#39; of 24th March, when the  president  of the Australian Road Transport Federation said: </para>

            <para class="block">The scandalous  ranks  of  trucks  which form up outside Sydney wharves  are a blot  on the largest ami busiest port in the Commonwealth.  1 do not wan; to develop this point any further. 1 think I have made the point sufficiently thai ports in Australia are in a bad state. They are not as efficient as they should be. There should be some central organisation with finances available to develop them. After all, the Commonwealth&#39; Government controls the finances of this country and it is in a position to make money available. We should be planning and developing ports throughout this nation. I do not wish to attack one authority as against another but I know of one case where within 20 miles 2 Slates, possibly on the basis of parish pump politics, are developing &#39; 2 deep sea ports. That is just a waste of national resources. We should have a co-ordinating authority to deal with such matters. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>As to transport facilities, too often the States through their railway systems are channelling freight back to their own capital cities when it would be much cheaper and much easier to direct it to the capital city or an export port of an adjoining State. There is a great need to have coordination through a central transport planning authority. Another feature which concerns the Opposition is the revolution (hat has taken place in the carriage of freight. An enormous change has taken place as a result of the introduction of containerisation, roll-on roll-off types of ships, stern loaders, side loaders, the Scandia type of ships, and unit loading. Containerisation has superseded the conventional type of ships with great holds and in some isolated cases shore cranes. We now have ships with cranes and the handling gear for the movement of cargo from ship to shore or from shore to ship. This revolution has had a widespread effect on the waterfront today. </para>
          <para>Only (his week the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> announced that the population of Australia has now passed the 121 million mark. Whilst Australia&#39;s volume of imports and exports is continuing to increase we find that the work force on the waterfront has dropped from 22,744 in 1964-65 to 18,040 in 1968-69, which is the latest year for which figures are available. During the last 5 years 4,704 men have left this industry. Some investigation should be undertaken by the Department of Labour and National Service or some other responsible body associated with the industry to find out just what is happening. Is the introduction of containers in the best interests of Australia&#39;s economy? Does containerisation represent economy? Does it represent a burden being imposed on one section of the community? </para>
          <para>With the possible exception of Fremantle, Sydney and Melbourne, all the ports of Australia are facing some problem as a result of the introduction of the types of ships I have referred to. An urgency motion was moved in this House and in the Senate by honourable members and senators concerned with the welfare of the people of Tasmania. That motion complained of insufficient shipping facilities for Tasmania and also increased freight charges. The Port of Newcastle has its own problems. The waterfront unions are continually meeting to discuss problems within the industry. Employers, through the Chamber of Commerce Shipping Committee, are continually meeting in the endeavour to solve problems created by the introduction of containerisation and similar types of shipping. The same can be said about the Port of Albany in Western Australia, Portland, Adelaide, Brisbane and all other ou &#39;-ports. </para>
          <para>Before the introduction of containerisation these ports had a regular flow of ships which picked up particular cargoes. This applies particularly to Portland and Albany where for many years conventional ships called to pick up wool and at the same time loaded and discharged general cargo. Now, as a result of containerisation, the wool is being shipped in containers to the central port which in Western Australia is Fremantle, in New South Wales is Sydney, and in Victoria it is Melbourne. The result has been that ships which previously called at these out-ports to pick up wool now have to collect the wool at the central port and do not collect or discharge general cargo at the outport. This in itself is having a serious effect on labour. The frequency of visits by ships has been reduced. Previously in some ports there may have been a weekly, a monthly or a 3-monthly visit by ships of a particular line to pick up certain commodities. Monthly visits have now become 3-monthly or 4-monthly visits. As a result people who export particular goods have had to find a means of stowing those goods and of transporting them to the buyer, which invariably means that the cargo has to be sent from the port where it was previously shipped back to the central port or to one of the three which I have referred to - Fremantle, Melbourne or Sydney. </para>
          <para>This problem should be examined by a government department, whether it be the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of Shipping and Transport or the Department of Trade and Industry. The problem is growing day by day because of the effects that it is having on industry. I know that industries in Newcastle in my electorate are greatly inconvenienced, particularly in the shipment of mineral sands, phosphate and the like. Whereas they had a regular calling of ships on a set timetable, they now have to ship through Sydney. </para>
          <para>Even organisations like the Newcastle Branch of Aid-Retarded Persons New South Wales are affected by containerisation. The Newcastle Branch of this body has built up a connection with an importer in Malaysia and regularly ships large quantities of paper to Malaysia. From this the organisation receives considerable revenue and it provides employment for people who need specialised type of employment. The branch rang me recently to tell me that it had so much paper it did not know where to put it. Its officers could hardly move in its establishment which was so stacked with paper. The organisation could not get a ship to call to take the paper away. Although only a small amount of profit is involved, the collection and export of this paper provides employment. However, the organisation cannot afford the cost of shipping the paper to Sydney for export to Malaysia. This is another of the problems that has arisen as a result of the changeover from conventional type shipping to containerisation. </para>
          <para>In the last report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority reference is made to the amount of time lost by men in the industry. I address my remarks to the number of cases in which hours have been lost not as a result of the employees&#39; actions but as a result of delays occasioned by employers, invariably the shipowners. In many cases hours have been lost because gear for handling cargo has not conformed with the Navigation (Loading and Unloading - Safety Measures) Regulations. This is the responsibility of the employers of waterfront labour and the shipowners. In 1964-65 there were 148 cases resulting in a loss of 14,494 hours; in 1965-66 there were 108 cases involving 13,530 man hours lost; in 1966-67 a total of 14,425 man hours were lost; in 1967-68 there were 140 cases with 17,526 hours lost; and in 1968-69, which was the worst year, there were 243 cases costing 22.446 hours. Thus in the last 5 years, because of employer negligence, 82,421 man hours have been lost. </para>
          <para>When the. Stevedoring Industry Authority is critical of the trade union movement for taking strike action I feel that it should also try to rectify the situation to which I have just referred. All of the stoppages could have been avoided if management, employers of labour and shipowners had been prepared to rectify the things about which the men went on strike. Let me instance some of the faulty gear involved in 1968-69. There were 45 cases of defective winches and/or cranes involving the loss of 2,990 man hours; there were 27 cases of defective ships gangways and 1 ,264 hours were lost: defective cargo runner splices  -  22 cases and 3,081 hours lost; and defective hold ladders  -  1 1 cases and 324 hours lost. There is no justification for ladders in ships holds being defective. There is no justification for gangways being defective or for winches and cranes being defective. There were 85 cases of unmarked or defective items of cargo gear, and these involved 1 1 ,560 hours tost. These are all items that should have been rectified by the shipowners or by employers of waterfront labour. If they had been reclined it would have eliminated one of the features of waterfront employment that needle men in the industry or. for that matter, in any industry. Men do not want to work under unsafe conditions and frequently they have to take the action of stopping work to get these defects remedied. </para>
          <para>Prior to the commencement of this debate the Minister made a statement during which he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">There will be no retrenchment of the ASIA staff within the next 12 months except in those ports in which permanent employment is introduced in that period. </para>

          <para class="block">We accept the position that when permanency is introduced into a port there are problems associated with it, but if it is adequately planned in advance and men are acquainted with what their position will be many of the problems associated with redundancy can be overcome.

The Opposition believes that the Austraiian Stevedoring Industry Authority should be extending its activities to encompass those matters to which I have referred. If need be, a complete stevedoring unit could be set up to carry out the work of stevedoring and, most importantly, it could work with the States or with authorities in the States in developing ports. After all it is through ports that Australian imports and exports are transported. If we do not have first class ports that are comparable in efficiency with overseas ports obviously we are placing an additional financial burden on our trade which makes it more difficult for our exporters to compete on the world market. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr FOSTER</inline>(Sturt) &#91;3.91-1 support the Bill and in so doing want to trace somewhat briefly the history of the trade union movement in respect of the waterfront. Originally the waterfront unions came into being because of the imposition of shocking conditions in The Rocks area of Sydney in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s when waterfront employees were a disorganised force of people who were traded upon by independent shipowners and were subjected to the most frightful conditions imaginable, as were their counterparts of that day in the United Kingdom. One of the founders was a person who became Prime Minister of this country. This man, who had led the Labor Party, apparently forgot later the very sound principles that he had learnt in his early years and became the Prime Minister of Australia as leader of another Party. </para>
          <para>Organised labour commenced from that point of time. The union has indeed been, in the eyes of our political opponents, an extremely boisterous and militant union, because the people now on the Government benches have never endeavoured to understand the waterfront industry and its problems. They have never endeavoured to understand the system, if one may refer to it as such, of exploitation by those of greed of those who were expecting a fair share of what they were entitled to for their work and because of the conditions under which they worked and a whole host of other things. The industry during the course of the mid- 1920s or late 1920s was lorn asunder by industrial strife when one union was set against another. During the depression years one of the most shocking systems of engaging labour in this country or any other country - at least by western standards - was introduced. It was one of the most shocking systems ever imposed on the waterfront industry. This was the bull system of picking up labour. Under this system men were given favours by bosses because they were prepared to settle a bar score for the bosses or were prepared perhaps to pay other bills that the bosses would run up generally in waterfront business houses. This is a system that can indeed only be described as shocking. </para>
          <para>Where then did human dignity manifest itself? How far can one push a human being and expect him not to realise that he is a human being? During the course of the late 1930s men throughout Australia who had been subjected to these intolerable conditions realised that they had little to lose by taking the form of action that they did take in the late 1 930s and early 1 940s. They demanded such things as a rosier system that had as its purpose the taking away from the bosses, the foremen and the bulls of the industry the right to he rc-employ-sd day after day whereas their fellows in the industry were getting no monetary return whatsoever. What was wrong with the very fine principle that the amount of work available in the industry should be shared by all in the industry? Under the bull system 15% got everything that was going and all the monetary  it-turn,  and everyone else had to share absolute and utter poverty. From this state of affairs grew the combined action of union men who expressed themselves in a very militant fashion. This was brought about, of course, by the conditions under which they were expected to slave. They came up against the system of the masters, the absentee employers, the shipowners, the shipowners&#39; agents, the stevedoring companies, the shipowners&#39; imported supervisors and all these other attendant difficulties.. Of course, as soon as the union saw that the labour position in the late 1930s and into the 1940s was such that they were in a better posi-lion industrially, is it any wonder that it resorted to the type of action that it was forced into in a desire to win conditions of no less value than those in industry generally? There were . many bitter fights in regard to these matters. </para>
          <para>During the early 1940s, after the Treasury bench here was vacated by the political opponents of the trade union movement generally, the Stevedoring Industry Commission was set up. There was provision on the Commission for what one would like to be able to regard as being equal representation. There was representation for the employers, which gave the shipowner representation because of his right to appoint those representatives who were managers of stevedoring companies and the like. Also there were representatives of the trade union movement - namely of the Waterside Workers Federation. While one does not dispute that there were disputes during the war years - and much criticism flowed to the organisation because it took strike action - at least I was one who was in the field and realised the union&#39;s position. I did not in any way criticise it for the form of action it was forced to take to ensure that its members would not return to a form of the treatment after the cessation of hostilities that had been imposed on them for many scores of years. However, there were many conditions that the union saw fit to act against, such as men working around the clock continuously - working on the job for scores of hours, almost, at a time. The union saw fit to introduce a shift system into the industry. Was there anything wrong with this? Everyone else in industry had these conditions. But the conditions could not be obtained without head on clashes with management and the like. </para>
          <para>After the war years the union had to resort to very strong and firm militant action to win the condition that workers in the industry were not required to stay on the job, not just for 24 hours but for something like double and more. Of course, this led to industrial disputation. There was some difference of opinion between the government of the day and the union about the Stevedoring Industry Commission which led to the removal of the 2 representatives of the Federation. Later the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board was set up, and representation was denied to the Federation. This laid the foundation for many a bitter struggle that ensued over the years and continued to make itself felt within the industry right up to 1965. During this, period the Federation was engaged in some struggles about conditions that other unionists had enjoyed and, of course, which some unionists had not enjoyed. This placed the Federation, very proudly, in the forefront as a condition winner for a number of organisations, a role which it still continues to play very admirably on behalf of the whole trade union movement. The Federation ought to be commended for adopting that line. I hope and trust that the union will continue to do that. </para>
          <para>I would, of course, deplore that in this day and age the union would have to continue to resort to industrial action to achieve those worthwhile gains - worthwhile in the eyes of its membership and the eyes of the leaders of the trade union movement who represent that membership. The industry wanted such things as annual leave, payment for sick leave and payment for public holidays. But the union was not able to achieve these simple conditions that had prevailed for many years in other industries throughout the Commonwealth. Any case put forward by anyone in the industry, be it the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, which was set up in about 1956, the employer organisations, or any direct representation by the Federation through the Australian Council of Trade Unions which is the recognised head of the trade union movement - and these bodies met consistently - was not acceded to. The requests of the trade unions were not accepted on such matters as the simple conditions of annual leave, public holidays, guaranteed shifts. As a result, unsettled conditions started to manifest themselves. Pensions were mentioned many, many years ago also. Pension rights were not achieved for some considerable time after. </para>
          <para>Let me continue along in this speech, as it were, to what happened in 1965. Continual disputes occurred throughout the industry. We in the Australian Waterside Workers Federation were accused by almost all Government members of being led by Communists. We were anarchists and all sorts of violent, frightful things. Many legislative measures moved against the trade union movement in this chamber by the Government were directed against the Federation in the stupid and forlorn hope - the Government was misguided then; I hope that it does not continue to be misguided in the future - that such measures in fact would overcome the problems of an industry fraught with problems. </para>
          <para>The Government, the Department of Labour and National Service and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority were never prepared really to examine the industry at its grass roots. Many a committee was set up. One such committee was the Bastin Committee which delivered a report on permanency and other provisions for the industry. The Government shelved that report. It looked at it occasionally, ft was not prepared to do anything constructive about the recommendations in that report. Bastin finished up disgusted no doubt because, despite his efforts, the Government took no action with respect to some of the grass roots problems associated with an important industry in the transport field to which he drew its attention. </para>
          <para>In the early 1960s, the Government commenced a vicious campaign. This was done with the Austraiian Stevedoring Industry Authority. Before I proceed to deal with that, I draw to the attention of the House a matter that 1 did not intend to mention. In that time, 2 strikes took place. One was held in 1954 and lasted for 2 weeks; the other, held in 1956, continued for approximately the same time. Each of these strikes would have been avoided if some proper and clear understanding had existed, in the first instance, on the claims made regarding margins and, in the second instance, on the right to recruit. Neither of these 2 long drawn out strikes in which the workers struggled on for 3 weeks would have been necessary if commonsense had prevailed and the employers, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, and the Government ministers of the day had been prepared to sit down, realise the merits of the claims and consider them on a proper basis. </para>
          <para>I come lo the 1960s When the Waterside Workers Federation and the trade union movement on the waterfront were attacked viciously on disciplinary measures. Breaches or alleged breaches by nien, including foremen and supervisors, in the main capital city ports, were reported. These men were marched up before the Authority and were suspended for 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, or even up to 3 weeks. Naturally, their fellow workers were incensed by such vicious injustice. No right of appeal of any type was available to any tribunal or inquiry. No rights of appeal, in the real sense of the term, existed. The burden of proof was with the individuals concerned, the trade union organisations and in every direction other than those who were intent on this stupid idea that they would destroy the militant action of waterside workers and would deny to them their rights to set about winning further conditions for themselves, by application of this most vicious system of discipline. </para>
          <para>A system known on the waterfront as the hostage system&#39; was introduced. This was one of the most vicious schemes ever introduced industrially in this Commonwealth. Let me illustrate what happened. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and I were suspended and our mates went out on strike in support ot us. the Authority would say: &#39;Well, you are suspended for a normal working day*. In 2 ports in Australia, sonic 5,000 or 6.000 members - a paltry number of men - could be out on strike because of some intolerable condition of employment that affected you and me. A waterside worker who was at home on that occasion unable to work would be informed that he had been suspended for that day or for the period of the stoppage. To the suspension for 1 day might be added another day&#39;s suspension, and so on and so on. With measures such as these being imposed upon workers in the industry, how could the Government and others concerned hope to achieve industrial peace in this field in Australia? These people were proud and glad to call themselves Australians. </para>
          <para>In 1965 a most vicious piece of legislation was introduced into this House by the then Minister for Labour and National Service, the present Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> That legislation was introduced in the forlorn hope that it would cure once again the ills of the waterfront industry. I sat in the Opposition gallery in this chamber as I see people sitting in it this afternoon. I found it almost impossible to restrain myself as I listened to the then Minister for Labour and National Service deliver his second reading speech. My feelings at that time were the same as they are at this moment as I consider this legislation. Casting my mind back, I remember that my feelings were those of absolute disgust to think that there were people who purported to have any common sense at all and who were endeavouring to introduce a measure of that type in the hope that it would cure industrial ills and bring about industrial peace. I was filled with a feeling of disgust that they were born in the same country as I. </para>
          <para>That legislation provided for and sought to aid and abet any small number of men in ports like Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle, Brisbane and Hobart who to gather together and to form themselves into a trade union organisation correctly regarded as a scab organisation. That organisation was given the blessing of the Minister of the day and the Government of the day in order to pit the loyalties of one man against another man and to aid and abet as well as to encourage it. That was the thinking of members of the Government some of whom, unfortunately, are still here. They thought that they could overcome such industrial unrest by that type of legislation. </para>
          <para>This belief is shown in all these Hansards that I have before me on my desk. It would take me a considerable time to refer to each passage and to read it. The Communist element is mentioned God knows how many times. The present Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> won his way into this House by witch hunting on the waterfront. This won him a position on the ministerial front bench of the Government. He was successful because of his witch hunting and head hunting on the waterfront and because of the fact that he could name who were and who were not </para>
          <para class="block">Communists. But, finally, he had to back off because he could not say that some 26,000 members of the trade union movement working on the waterfront are all Communists; nor could he say that all the officials in the trade union movement were Communists. At the time when he was making these allegations, I was sitting on the Federal Council of the organisation. I have sat as a member of that body since 1959. I am not going to say in this chamber what my attitude was regarding what the Minister may have thought or what he may still think. The point I want to make is the absolute stupidity of the Government of the day in thinking for a moment that it could cure the industrial ills of this industry by such action. </para>
          <para>What then did it do? Have honourable members opposite ever sat down to reflect on what their Government did in 1965? The effect of the action of the Government was to unite the Australian Waterside Workers Federation and its members more than ever. All members - man to man, gang to gang on the waterfront, port to port, output to mainport and mainport to capita&#93; port - were determined that they were not going to allow that type of legislation to break their ranks. Honourable members must realise that this was just what they were able to do. </para>
          <para>They, in association with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, took over the role of the negotiator. The then  President  of the ACTU sought to confer with the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, who at that time became more closely associated with the waterfront. He became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The  President  of the ACTU was able to confer with the then Prime Minister who had this somewhat false title bestowed upon him. He was able to convince the Prime Minister that in fact the trade union movement was rallying on the basis that it would not cop this type of legislation. As a result of that legislation and unknown to the government of the day an inquiry was set up and discussions took place for some considerable time. I was engaged in some of them. Recommendations were sent to stop work meetings from time to time throughout the length and breadth of the country, progress reports of what was taking place at those conferences were presented and finally the vast majority of members of the trade union movement associated with the waterfront accepted from their leaders the concept of permanency on the waterfront, at least at capital ports in the initial stages. The Bill before us this afternoon  -  I almost said tonight&#39; by habit - makes provision for a continuation of the permanency agreements throughout the Commonwealth. We do not oppose the Bill in any way, shape or form but permit me to say, if 1 may, if the Government, in view of the increased efficiency and throughput on the waterfront today, and having regard to the shocking mistakes of the Minister for Trade and industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> and the Federation in wrapping themselves up in the containerisation programme, had had enough commonsense, decency and recognition of this, it would have removed by this Bill those lousy clauses that it was so stupid to put on the statute book in .1965. lt is never too late to hope that the Government might do this but it will not be given the opportunity. The. Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> sees lit to interject at the last stage of my speech. I told him once before in this House that Attorneys-General come last so I will put him last. He and the Government he supports have been so muddled in their thinking on the various amendments - this is perhaps one of them  -  that they have put in the Stevedoring Industry Act that his Department is unable even lo interpret the rubbish that the Government has included in the Bill from time to time. He would be hard pressed to state points with clarity let alone an interpretation of the measures that they in desperation have seen fit lo put through. I wind up on the note that the Government will not be in charge of the next Bill relative to the mailer that comes down after some 2 years. The Party occupying the Opposition benches today will be the Government, lt is the only Party which recognises the industrial rights of wage and salary earners generally, and it will take care of them because it understands people. </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  J present the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Honourable members will recall that on 25th September last my predecessor made a statement in this House relating to allegations of i lt- treatment of the junior class al the Royal Military College, Duntroon. At the conclusion of the statement he informed the House that, because of the facts then established and other considerations, he had appointed a Committee of Inquiry to examine the whole philosophy underlying the training of the junior class at Duntroon. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In order to ensure the most searching and objective study my predecessor decided that the Committee should be headed by an independent external authority. As was announced at the time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, agreed to undertake the inquiry. The members of the Committee were most carefully selected. They were: <inline font-weight="bold">Dr A.</inline> J, M. Sinclair, Consulting Psychiatrist; Professor L. C. F. Turner, then  Chairman  of the Faculty of Military Studies, University of New South Wales; Brigadier G. D. Solomon, the Director of Military Training at Army Headquarters Canberra; and Brigadier C. M. I. Pearson - now Major-General Pearson - who had been Commander of the Australian Task Force in Vietnam, later Commander of the First Division based in Sydney, New South Wales, and who is now Commandant of the Royal Military College. </para>
          <para>The terms of reference of the Committee were deliberately framed in the widest possible terms and indeed the Committee&#39;s investigations covered a wide range of matters well beyond the basic subject upon which it was set up to report. </para>
          <para>On 24th December 1969, 1 issued a Press release giving a summary of an interim report I had received from the Committee. This was done because the House was not then sitting and it was the judgment of the Committee that some of the findings - as had been requested by the then Minister - should be applied to cadets first entering Duntroon at the beginning of 1970. It was obviously desirable that all cadets then about to enter the College, and their parents and friends, should know not only that changes at the College were imminent but also the details of those changes. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, and following discussion with the Military Board, I announced that approval had been given for the following changes at Duntroon: &#39; </para>
          <para>First year cadets would arrive at the College on 20th January - 3 days earlier than the originally planned date. This would enable them to see something of the Royal Military College and Canberra, in an informal way, before settling down to normal training. </para>
          <para>Academic staff and First Class (senior year) cadets would visit the junior cadets in their orientation camp at Point Hut. </para>
          <para>Under-officers and non-commissioned officers of the Corps of Staff Cadets would remain responsible for the management of the day-to-day affairs of the Corps, but the Commanding Officer and his staff would exercise a close, though so far as possible, unobtrusive, supervision of its activities. </para>
          <para>The previous system, in which new cadets were required to learn some matters in their own time and under the direction of other cadets, would be replaced by formal instruction and explanation. These matters include the history and tradition of the Army and the College; behaviour and attitude of the cadets inside and outside the College; and the care of rooms, uniforms and equipment. </para>
          <para>The Committee, by this time, had received most of the evidence likely to be available to it and was then proceeding to the preparation of its final report. It should be mentioned that the Committee, in discharging its duties, met both in Canberra and in Sydney. It interviewed 91 witnesses in person and considered 10 written submissions from people who were not personally interviewed but who had responded to newspaper advertisements to place views before the Committee. </para>
          <para>The witnesses and written statements were drawn from widely differing ranks within the Australian Army, and other armies, and included some still on the Active List and others who had retired. Additionally, evidence was received from members of the clergy, academics, under-graduate educationists, those skilled in psychology and related disciplines as well as others. I have taken the view that the evidence was tendered in confidence and therefore Annexures I - &#39;Transcript of Interviews by the Committee&#39; - and J - &#39;Copies of writer submissions considered by the Committee&#39; - have not been included. </para>
          <para>I pause here, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to record my own appreciation and that of the Fox Committee of those who went to the trouble to make known their views on the matters under consideration by the Committee. Their respective contributions were most valuable. </para>
          <para>Under date 24th April 1970, the Committee tendered its full report to me. As 1 mentioned previously, its conclusions and recommendations are comprehensive and cover not only matters coming specifically within its charter but also a range of matters which affect, directly or indirectly, all members of the Corps &#39;of Staff Cadets and not just those in first year. </para>
          <para>The Committee re-affirmed the view expressed in its interim report that the practices which have become known as &#39;bastardisation&#39; should be banned. This issue was dealt with in detail in the statement made to the House by my predecessor on 25th September and which I have already mentioned. I agree with the views he then expressed and the positive steps which were authorised to prevent a recurrence of these unfortunate breaches of official instructions. </para>
          <para>As regards the Corps of Staff Cadets generally the Committee recommended that: </para>
          <para>The Regulations dealing with resignation and discharge should be liberalised. There should be no requirement to enter into any bond on joining the College. </para>
          <para>The living and working conditions of the cadets should be relaxed and improved. Specific recommendations were made in relation to daily routine, local leave, alcohol, pay, marriage, church parades, cars, dress, the entertainment of visitors and summary punishments. </para>
          <para>The Committee also commented upon such mutters as the relationship between the Royal Military College and the University of New South Wales, diversification of the academic curriculum, post-graduate work, the period of appointment of military officers to Duntroon, the revision of College regulations and of the Standing Orders of the Corps of Staff Cadets. </para>
          <para>Apart from those recommendations of the Committee which deal directly with the question of ill-treatment of the junior class at Duntroon and which have already been implemented, as announced last December, the wide range of matters which the Committee has covered requires detailed examination and consideration not only by the College authorities, the Interim Council of the Royal Military College and the Military Board, but also in relation to some aspects on an inter-departmental basis. 1 have directed that urgent steps be taken to have all matters considered by the appropriate bodies and brought to finality as early as practicable. </para>
          <para>I believe it will be clear to the House that all concerned with the administration of the Army have made every endeavour to take positive action in relation to events at Duntroon which commenced with the allegation of the ill-treatment of junior cadets. The findings of the Fox Committee are concerned with the future, and in concluding I. wish to stress the importance of the Royal Military College to the Army and through it to the nation. It remains for me to record further my appreciation for the workmanlike manner and dispatch with which the Fox Committee discharged its charter. I am most grateful to members of the Committee, both individually and as a group. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> has tabled the report of thu Committee of Inquiry into the Royal Military College, Duntroon, headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox. This inquiry was ordered by the Minister&#39;s predecessor, the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> after considerable controversy in the Press and iti this Parliament over the treatment of junior cadets at the Royal Military College. An interim report was made to the Minister and he released details of it on Christmas Eve last year. As a result of this interim report changes were made in the treatment of cadets entering Duntroon at the beginning of this year. These changes seem to have worked effectively. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The full report which has now been tabled goes beyond these initial measures; it recommends a radical set of reforms designed to transform the whole atmosphere and procedure of the College. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox and his Committee was submitted to the Minister on 24th April. It has now been tabled 6 weeks later with the parliamentary session drawing to a close. The Minister seems to have encountered some difficulty in getting this report before the Parliament. I am glad he was able to table it before the recess so the House can make a detailed assessment of it. </para>
          <para>When this Committee was announced on 25th September I said in this House that its basic task was to solve the problems associated with absorbing a traditional military institution into an academic framework. This followed the affiliation of the College with the University of New South Wales. It was because of this affiliation that the practices collectively described as bastardisation&#39; of fourth class cadets were revealed. There was a clash between the concepts of academic freedom held by academics and the rigid traditionalism of the Army. </para>
          <para>It should be noted here that members of the academic staff showed considerable courage in rejecting the practice qf bastardisation&#39; and bringing it to the public view. This set in motion the rapid sequence of events which has culminated in this report. I do not want to go over the practice of &#39;bastardisation&#39; which was dealt with in the debate last year. In essence it was the survival of traditional military practice in a changed environment; what once was acceptable in a rigidly-disciplined military college could no longer be tolerated in a changing institution mingling academic and military scholarship, and moving towards greater autonomy. Preliminary measures have been taken to eliminate bastardisation from the College; these have now been supplemented by a much more extensive set of recommendations. The recommendations of the Fox Committee seem to me to be eminently sane and reasonable. The way has been clear for the complete abolition of bastardisation by the recommendation that informal instruction of the fourth class by senior cadets be abolished. This was a major source of pin-pricking by the performance of absurd tasks and the learning in parrot fashion of trivial information. It is proper that instruction in the history, traditions and curriculum of Duntroon be put on a more formal basis. </para>
          <para>The recommendations designed to end bastardisation in the mess, the bathrooms and by the imposition of group tasks, fagging, and special restrictions, are extremely judicious. I am sure honourable members will agree with the Committee&#39;s conclusion that bastardisation is senseless and degrading; it is not countenanced elsewhere in the Army and there is no place for it at Duntroon. The report emphasises that bastardisation cannot be ended merely by issuing a decree: lt will have to be closely and energetically supervised until the propensity for such behaviour abates. The Committee goes on to advocate dramatic innovations in conditions of service. The net effect of these recommendations would be to give cadets much more freedom and make their life comparable with that of students at other institutions of higher education. </para>
          <para>A most important proposal is the abolition of the requirement that cadets who resign have to pay out sums varying between S300 and $1,500. This condition has been a source of much bitterness and it should be abolished. The recommendations on daily routine, local leave, discipline, alcohol, pay, marriage, cars, dress, and entertainment of visitors will, if adopted, give cadets a much more attractive environment in which to live and work. The report goes on to indicate broad guidelines for the development of the Royal Military College. In brief, these guidelines prescribe a gradual movement towards autonomy of the College, more students, more varied courses, and the relationship between the military staff, the academic staff and the cadets. These recommendations are generally sound and I intend to make only a few comments. </para>
          <para>The Committee looks to a closer association with the Australian National University. This is particularly desirable because of the remarkable success and growth of the University&#39;s Institute of Strategic Studies in the past 2 years. A. much more sophisticated and responsive climate for discussion of defence issues is emerging in Canberra and will become increasingly important in the next few years. It is appropriate that Duntroon plays an important role in the more informed evaluation of defence policies. </para>
          <para>In considering student numbers, the Committee was inhibited by the lack of precise information about the Government&#39;s plans for a tri-Service college. It is true, as the report points out, that there are too few cadets to ensure a comprehensive and completely autonomous institution with a high calibre staff, full facilities and a desirable variety of courses. A tri-Service college would be one solution. Unfortunately, it is not possible to consider this in the absence of the long-mooted report on the Government&#39;s plans for such an institution. The Committee suggests the widening of conditions of entry so that general students who do not intend to enter permanent military service can enter. It is vaguely suggested that young men who want to be Citizen Military Forces officers could find this attractive. Some broadening of the student body may be desirable but I feel that a concept of this sort is getting much too far away from the basic objective of professional military training. On the extension of the curriculum, the Committee recommends the setting up of courses in psychology, languages - particularly Asian languages - and military law. These are excellent suggestions. The teaching of military law as an academic subject is particularly relevant with the introduction of a joint military code for the Services foreshadowed in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech earlier this year. </para>
          <para>In summary, the Committee has made 20 specific recommendations designed to remove for all time the stain of bastardisation from Duntroon and assure an attractive and creative environment for the training of military officers. Many of these changes will be resisted by traditional elements in the Army. It is difficult for successful career officers to recognise the flaws in a system which trained them successfully, and one can sympathise with this attitude. But, with military education developing so rapidly and moving into closer alliance with conventional academic scholarship, bastardisation cannot be tolerated; all vestiges of it must be eradicated. The Minister for the Army acted correctly and promptly by introducing the interim measures recommended by the Committee for the start of the 1970 academic year at Duntroon. It is now his duty to finish the job by adopting in toto the recommendations on assimilation of cadets and conditions of service made by the Committee. There is no reason why these important innovations and reforms should not be operating effectively at the College by the time the 1971 academic year begins. This can only bring immeasurable benefit to the Royal Military College. The Opposition welcomes the report and insists that the sweeping changes it proposes be treated as a matter of urgency. In conclusion, I thank the Minister for his courtesy in making available to me early last night a copy of the Fox report so that I could study it for this debate. </para>

            <para>-  The Opposition protests against the way the Bill is being rushed through Parliament without a proper opportunity to debate it. Conciliation and arbitration is far too important a question to be hurried through the Parliament with such undue haste as this Bill is being hurried through. This was an opportunity for the Parliament to make conciliation and arbitration work, and we have got to make it work if we are to avoid industrial chaos and a continuation of the kind of industrial disputation that has marked the last 10 or 20 years. Arbitration can be made to work, but it will not be made to work unless this Parliament gets down and grapples with the problem in a businesslike fashion. I am certain I could make arbitration work. Given time to explain what I believe to be the weakness of the arbitration system; I am certain I could convince the Parliament that there Ls a way of making it work. Indeed, I would be prepared to gamble on my reputation as one with a fairly good knowledge of industrial relations that, if my propositions were adopted, conciliation and arbitration and industrial peace would become a reality in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has taken one step towards the settlement of industrial disputes as a consequence of the tripartite agreement made between the employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government itself; but that agreement, which in outline is quite good I believe, will fail because not sufficient attention has been given to some of the details. Nothing has been done to protect the rank and file man in industry from victimisation; nothing has been done to protect the shop steward from victimisation. Moreover, nothing has been done to define the term &#39;industrial safety problems&#39;. What are they? The term is just a vague abstract thing in the agreement which could mean anything. I think both the employers of Australia and the unions of Australia will be bitterly disappointed when they read tomorrow&#39;s newspapers and find that the most vital piece of legislation to which this Parliament could possibly apply itself was pushed through the Parliament when most of the members were away and when everybody was in haste to get home. Even as I am speaking now, members on the other side are glaring at me as though I have no right even to take the time&#39; necessary to say what I am now saying. I believe that this is the wrong atmosphere and that it is the wrong sort of timetable in which to deal with this sort of matter. </para>

            <para>- The Bill takes away from the court the power to issue an injunction under section 109 of the Act against an organisation or person to observe an award. Section J 1 1 at present provides penalties of $1,000 for a union, $400 or gaol for an official  of the union, and $100 for a rank and file member or a shop steward of a union for contempt of such order. These penal provisions are to bc transferred to section 119 of the Act :n a form th&#39;.i makes it unnecessary for an employer to first of all obtain an injunction before proceeding to have, the new penalties imposed. The only difference is that the matter must first be reported to a presidential member, but after this is done - that is, after the presidential member has looked at it - and a certificate has been issued stating that the matter is one that comes within the requirements of thu Act, the court can then bc called upon to impose a fine of $1,000 on a union official instead of the present $400 maximum fine and of $1,000 on a rank and file member of a union or shop steward instead of the present $100 fine. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only exception there will be to this will be in cases where a special provision <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> written into an award that each day of a dispute shall be treated as a separate dispute, so that if the dispute lasted for only I day the maximum fine for a union or official, shop steward, job representative or rank and file member of a union would be reduced to $500, but if the dispute lasted <inline font-style="italic">for S</inline> days the maxima would become $2,500 for even  a  rank and file unionist or shop steward who was in breach of the award or Act. Similarly, should the dispute last for a fortnight the maximum fine applicable to a union, union official, shop steward or even a rank and file member would be no less than $5,000 in respect of I dispute. </para>
          <para>The Bill will preserve all existing bans clauses written into awards by Conciliation Commissioners but will provide that in future only  a  presidential member will have power to write  a  bans clause into an award. If it is now recognised that it is wrong in principal for  a  Commissioner to write  a  bans clause into an award, the Government should have provided that existing bans already put there by Commissioners should have no effect, as it has in fact done in respect of court injunctions currently in force under the provisions of section 109 of the Act. However, the Government has deliberately set out to incite discontent rather than to allay it by writing into the Bill a provision that all fines still outstanding shall continue to be enforceable. I think costs should not have been permitted by the Government when it was amending the Act, because when costs are permitted against parties appearing before the court they are very often greater than the fines and, indeed, the costs can be a deterrent against a unionist seeking his lawful rights under the Act. </para>
          <para>With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard a table showing the amount of fines and costs imposed upon various trade unions since 1957 for offences that should have been dealt with under section 119, which fixes a maximum penalty of $200. </para>

          <para class="block">I direct particular attention to the paragraphs from (e) to fi) inclusive. These are excellent propositions. I agree that some thing along these lines should be tried. This would go a long way towards easing the tensions that now build up in industry when they are not resolved by early remedy, lt is like any disease. If you want to cure it before it kills you, you must get in early. So it is with industrial disputes. We see no reason to criticise this. However, 1 criticise the Government, which is calling upon shop stewards to play this very important role now required of them, for not taking steps to protect them adequately from victimisation when carrying out their job. The best way to lose a job in industry is to be a good enough shop steward to convey to the boss all the complaints heard on the job. The unfortunate thing is that when a shop steward does that, the employer may accuse him of being a stirrer and agitator when in point of fact he is merely acting as spokesman for the men with whom he :s working. Because so many shop stewards have been dismissed for merely doing what the agreement now asks them to do, they are loath lo carry out their functions fearlessly, as they ought to be free to do. 1 believe the Government was gravely remiss in failing to attend to section 5 of the Act. This is the appropriate section for writing in lo the law the kind of protection for shop stewards about which I am now talking. It is not that the Government does not know about it. With the concurrence of the House I incorporate in Hansard the full text of section 5 of the Act. </para>

In any proceeding for an offence against this section, if nil the facts and circumstances constituting the offence, other than the reason for the defendant&#39;s action, are proved it shall lie upon the defendant to prove that he was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge. (5.) Where an employer has been convicted of an offence against this section the court by which the employer is convicted may order that the employee be reimbursed any wages lost by him and may also direct that the employee be reinstated in his old position or in a similar position. lt appears at first blush thai section 5 gives protection against victimisation, lt certainly appears to bc a section thai gives protection against a boss sacking a man for joining  a  union. But when one looks at it more closely one finds that this is not so. As usual, the judges on the Industrial Court, like judges everywhere else, are always anxious to show that they are superior to the draftsmen and always anxious to show that Parliament does not know how to express itself when it wants something done. Their usual hypercritical attitude towards the meaning of words has ruined this section by the interpretation that they have given to it. The Court&#39;s interpretation is a most ridiculous interpretation if ever there was one, and it has come from judges who pretend that when they interpret the law they are always guided by the principle of commonsense. </para>
          <para>I invite honourable members to listen to this example of commonsense. Here is a judgment made by the Full Industrial Court in the case of Gietzelt v. Craig-Williams Pty Ltd in 1959. Among other things, the judgment contains these gems of wisdom from the Chief Justice. He was speaking about the kind of conduct of which the employer was guilty when he sacked a person for joining a union. It was admitted by the evidence that the person was sacked because he joined the union. He then took action against the employer. I will read to the House what the judge said section 5 meant. Perhaps he was technically right, but who wants to live on technicalities. We have too many technicalities, and that is the trouble with the arbitration and conciliation system. This is what the Chief Justice said in the last paragraph of the judgment </para>
          <para>This course of conduct was clearly contrary to the spirit if not the letter of section 5. A good deal of evidence placed before us related to this aspect of the matter. In these circumstances although the charge in my opinion must fail because of the failure of the informant to prove a threat to dismiss I would dismiss the summons but make no order as to costs. </para>
          <para class="block">Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy agreed with that. He said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">For instance because he is a shop steward or a member of the union. The learned judges say that that only means he cannot threaten him. If he sacks him without the threat it is okay. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Morgan, for whose knowledge of the law I have a profound respect, very reluctantly had to admit that in his opinion that is what it meant. </para>
          <para class="block">At least he was consistent enough to say that in his opinion the union which took the complaint against the boss for sacking the person without threatening him and therefore acted in accordance with a legal right of the employer to do this ought to be made to pay the boss&#39;s costs. </para>
          <para>I asked the Minister&#39;s predecessor whether he would do something to alter this section of the Act in such a way that it would no longer be possible for a boss to sack a man for joining a union or for taking part in union activities. I think to merely say that he cannot threaten to do these things but that it is lawful to do them without threat is ridiculous. The Minister said: I do not know what you are talking about. Will you tell me something more about your question?&#39; In answer to a request of his that if I knew of any case would I please tell him, I wrote to him as follows: </para>

        <para class="block">He thanked me, but that is all 1 got - no action. I wanted action, I could have done without the thanks so long as I got the action. It is useless for the Government to say that it did not know about this. I took the initiative after this of asking the present Minister for Labour and National Service this question: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Will he codify decisions of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and, where such decisions are found to be contradictory or in conflict with the policy of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, take action to amend the Act in such a way as to eliminate ambiguities and injustices in the law? </para>
          <para class="block">Will he at the same time ensure that the law is brought into conformity with the policy of the Act? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Surely it was the policy of the Act to safeguard a member against being dismissed for joining a- union or for taking part in union activities. Therefore my question was based on that belief. This is what the Minister said in reply:  lt is the practice of my Department to examine all judicial decisions, including those of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, relevant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, so that these decisions can be taken into account when consideration is being given to amending the Act. </para>
        <para class="block">I now have another question on the notice paper.

        <para>I now return to the question of the protection of the rank and file in the trade union movement, particularly the protection of shop stewards, shop delegates and job representatives in industry, because if this agreement for settling disputes is to succeed, and 1 hope it does - I believe it could succeed if some more things were done - one of the urgent things that have to be done is to provide proper protection for the shop steward who has to carry out this important role.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">If ever there was a job to be done this is surely a job that ought to be tackled by the Department of Labour and National Service, ft must lay down a minimum code of safety standards to ensure that no-one suffers from industrial accident or disease. There is still no answer to that question either, and it probably will be some time before I get an answer. When the answer is received I will probably be told, if the rule is followed, that the thing is well in hand. </para>
        <para>I would like now, if I may, to refer to some cases that have come before the court  concerning victimisation. Let the Minister not continue to say in reply to another question which I have not time to read that there are no, or very few, cases of victimisation. Let me quote a few examples of victimisation. One is the case of the Electrical Trades Union v. the South Australian Railways. A shop steward was dismissed for writing improper remarks on a notice board. After hearing evidence Commissioner Portus said that he was not prepared to make an order for the union representative&#39;s reinstatement but would ask the Railways Commissioner to further consider the matter. The Railways Commissioner refused to reinstate this shop steward, whereupon the Commissioner stated that he considered the dismissal was reasonable and that, although the shop steward had tendered an apology for his remarks, he did not consider the apology was sufficient and would, therefore, make no order. The Commissioner went on to state that the fact that the employee was a shop steward was insignificant. That is the kind of protection they now get from the court when they are dismissed. </para>
        <para>In the case of the Transport Workers Union v. W. Woodroffe Ltd a spokesman for the union employees of the company had been dismissed allegedly for leaving his truck without permission. Commissioner Webb decided&#39; that the union representative had not been victimised because he had acted as the men&#39;s spokesman in various disputes with the company and said:  in my view in the absence of evidence of discrimination a&#39;n employee who is dismissed for knowingly disobeying his employer&#39;s orders has not been victimised. </para>
        <para class="block">What if the employer tells the union representative that he is not to go to his foreman during working hours? What if he tells the union representative that he is not to ring the union secretary during working hours? What if he tells the union representative that he is not to collect union dues in working hours? What if he tells the union representative that he is not to go from bench to bench seeking information as to grievances during working hours? What if he directs the union representative that he is not to go to the manager&#39;s office during working hours? If he fails to carry out such a direction it becomes a breach of an order. The agreement, of course, in these circumstances can never be implemented because the court will say: &#39;You were properly dismissed. Do not come to us for protection against being victimised&#39;. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I agree with the honourable member. I now take the case of the Building Workers Industrial Union v. Clements Langford Ltd. A union representative had been dismissed for informing the timekeeper that he was leaving the job for a short time, on the ground that his action was contrary to a company rule that no employee must leave a job without the permission of the foreman. The company went on to claim that the union representative had abused the foreman. What a terrible thing it is for these wild, red blooded men of spunk to be abusing each other. But he did it, so the foreman presumably sulked in the corner and said: &#39;He has abused me so I will sack him*. The union told Commissioner Findlay that its representative had been provoked into using bad language by the foreman and that, as a union representative, he had been deliberately victimised by the company. In giving his decision the Commissioner stated that as the union representative had absented himself without proper authority his dismissal was justified. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the case of Manufacturing Grocers Employees Union of Australia v. Cede! Products (Australia) Ltd a female employee had been appointed as a shop steward and had been dismissed. Commissioner Matthews, who heard the matter, was told by the union that female employees were not allowed a rest period as prescribed by the award; that uniforms were not provided in accordance with the award; that amenities were not provided in accordance with the award, and that there was no covering on the concrete floor as required under the award. The employer&#39;s defence was that the shop steward had been dismissed because of a reduction in her output of work. The employer admitted that overalls had not been supplied and he admitted that there was no covering on the floor. The Commissioner decided to make no order. </para>
          <para>There is also the case of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia v. Granock Engineering Co. Pty Ltd. This involved a union delegate who had been dismissed by the company on the ground that shortage of work necessitated a retrenchment of 2 ironworkers. The delegate&#39;s fellow members on the job claimed that their delegate had been retrenched out of seniority and was being victimised on account of his union activities. Commissioner Apsey, after hearing the parties and conferring privately, said that he had no jurisdiction to order the reinstatement of the retrenched union delegate. </para>
          <para>I am asking for jurisdiction. But the Government will not give it. Yet it expects the arbitration system to work when there is no jurisdiction and, it seems, no inclination on the part of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission through its commissioners to give adequate protection against victimisation of shop stewards. </para>
          <para>I now refer to the Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia v. Harmony Products Pty Ltd. An employee who had been underpaid for annual leave and public holidays and who had been wrongfully stood down for 2 days without pay had complained to the union about the matter and was subsequently dismissed due to insufficient work. The union claimed that the dismissal occurred as a result of the employee&#39;s union activities and that as a member of the union she should have received preference of employment when the retrenchment was made. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S.</inline> G. Hastings,  Chairman  of the Board of Reference slated that the employer had accepted the onus of proof concerning the dismissal, but after hearing certain evidence it was agreed not to submit any further evidence to the Board and tha; on the next occasion when the employer wished to engage another employee he should offer the vacancy to the dismissed employee if, in the opinion of the company, the work could he satisfactorily performed by her. As a result. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hastings</inline> decided to take no action. </para>
          <para>The next case is Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v. Thos. Borthwick &#38; Sons (Australia) Ltd. An employee wilh 21 years service as a boner was dismissed for ceasing work earlier than the normal time. The  Chairman  of the Board of Reference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> J. Mansini, stated that evidence had established beyond any doubt that the dismissed delegate of the union had completed the correct mini mum number of quarters for the day. However, he said that he was guilty of misconduct in leaving his place of work before finishing time, and he considered that there was no foundation for the suggestion that the employer had victimised him because of his union activities in the boning room. Always the employer can find some reason which appears to justify the action taken. Always the employer can sieze upon a misdemeanour on the part of a union representative and close his eyes to the same sort of thing happening all round the factory. Everybody knows that employers are not saints and everybody knows that there are employees in industry who are not saints. But after all, they are not kids going to kindergarten. They are all grown up men who will not be regimented like poorly paid mercenaries who are made to act at though they are robots. Of course the employees will do things which the employers are pleased to condemn as indiscretions and misconduct, but why should an employer see a union delegate doing these things and not be able to see the other 400 or 500 men who are also doing the same thing? </para>
          <para>Consider the case of the Federated Engine Drivers&#39; and Firemen&#39;s Association of Australasia v. the Minister of State for the Navy. Here we have the Commonwealth, a party to the award, being responsible for victimisation. A union delegate had been dismissed for allegedly using foul language and refusing to perform his normal duties. What a terrible thing! A man working in Cockatoo Dock had the audacity and, shall we say, insensitivity to use foul language, lt must have been a shock to hear foul language in a dockyard. Anyway, it was sufficient for him to be dismissed. Commissioner McCreadie made this important statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The true function of a union delegate or shop steward is, of course, a very important one in which he looks after the interests of his fellow members which, if not dealt with satisfactorily, can lead lo serious events. Bill, refusal of duly or other such serious matters arc noi the prerogative of a delegate. The job delegate or shop steward is not a union official; he therefore should refer important matters, or those which he considers are likely to develop into serious matters, to his union for attention.  Such  mailers are properly dealt with by union officials with their wider experience, knowledge and  understanding  of union policy. A stop steward or delegate who understands his functions and their limitations can, as most do, perform very useful work on  behalf of his union and its members, and make a valuable contribution to good industrial relations in an establishment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commissioner then went on to say that the evidence of foul language could be left to one side. At least the Commissioner was a man of the soil. He was satisfied, however, that the delegate had, on repeated occasions, refused to perform his normal duties and that the management of the Garden Island dockyards had acted with justification when it dismissed him. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia v. Clyde Batteries Pty Ltd Commissioner Hood found that there was no justification for suggesting that the retrenchment of the Union&#39;s shop steward was unjust or harsh in any measure even though the purported retrenchment on the ground of economic recession has taken place - that was the excuse given for his dismissal - while other employees with shorter service had been retained. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v. Amagraze Ltd a union delegate was dismissed and 32 boners who had attended a union meeting to discuss the dismissal were also dismissed and their accrued annual leave credits were cancelled. The company finally agreed to restore the leave credits but the  Chairman  of the Board of Reference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mansini,</inline> told the Union that the concession granted by the company rested entirely in the hands of the company. If the company gave it, he said, it was free to take it away at any time it chose. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Boilermakers&#39; and Blacksmiths&#39; Society of Australia v. World Services and Construction Co. Pty Ltd Commissioner Hood, after hearing submissions concerning the dismissal of a union delegate, held that the dismissal had been justified on the established facts of the case. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia v. A. A. Ellis &#38; Sutton Pty Ltd 3 girls were dismissed allegedly because of their activities as union delegates. Commissioner Findlay heard submissions and after conferring privately with the parties announced that he was satisfied that the employer had exercised an award right in discharging the delegates. He said that there was no evidence to substantiate the charge that the girls were dismissed on account of union activities. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Australian Textile Workers Union v. Stirling Henry Pty Ltd a union delegate with 8 years&#39; service had been put on to a new job which carried a rate of pay which the delegate considered unsatisfactory. In protest the delegate returned to his former job and was instantly dismissed, with a week&#39;s pay in Heu of notice. The delegate told Commissioner Findlay that the company had asked him to give up his job as union delegate and that he had been victimised because he refused to do so. The Commissioner said that, as the union delegate had returned to his old job without authority, his services could be terminated and in the circumstances he was not prepared to do anything about the matter. </para>
          <para>I recall that section 5 of the Act says that nobody shall be disadvantaged, dismissed or made to suffer injury. Surely it is a disadvantage to be shifted from a job that one likes with pay that one likes to a job that one docs not like with pay that one does not like. Surely it is a disadvantage to tell a precision toolmaker that he has to clean the toilets and be satisfied with the lower rate of pay as well as the dirtier work. Yet according to these judgments, a person can be transferred from the toolmaking shop to look after the toilets as a form of lawful punishment. If he refuses to do the work, all the employer has to say is that he refused to carry out a direction and there is then full justification for sacking him. </para>
          <para>In the case of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (Australian Section) v. Adelaide Steamship Co., a shop steward with 6 years&#39; service was dismissed on the ground that a slackness of work necessitated retrenchments. But of those retained in the service of the company 1 was over the retiring age and another had less than I year&#39;s service. When the matter went before Commissioner Portus the company changed its tune and said that the steward was dismissed because on a number of occasions he had not been on the job, that he had been found in the lunchroom during working hours and that he had been away from his work a dozen times in <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> years. The company admitted that he had never been warned that these alleged misdemeanours might lead to his dismissal. The Commissioner, however, said that the fact that the foreman had not warned the steward of the consequences of absence from work was not significant. Nor did he think it significant that one of the employees retained had less than I year&#39;s experience; he said that it did not take long for a good worker to become efficient as a tradesman&#39;s assistant. The Commissioner said he was satisfied that there were good grounds for the employee&#39;s dismissal and that no discrimination had been made against him on the ground that he was a shop steward. </para>
          <para>No wonder tradesman&#39;s assistants are noi able to get wage justice from the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission when Commissioners make stupid statements like that - that any person with average intelligence can become a good tradesman&#39;s assistant in a very short time. When we talk about people leaving their job for a few minutes, people being in the toilet when they ought not to be or being there too long, and people being in the lunchroom when they should not be there. I wonder how many of the foremen stick rigidly to the timetables set by their management and how many of the directors of a company stick to the office desk for the working hours that the employees are being dismissed for not observing. 1 could give many more similar cases of where a commission or a  chairman  of the Board had pleaded lack of power or indicated lack of inclination to take all steps necessary to prevent victimisation of a union delegate, shop steward or job representative. This nonsense, this hypocrisy that we hear from employers whenever cases of victimisation are being dealt with ought not to be tolerated. 1 remind the House of the decision made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Commissioner</inline> McCreadie in the case of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association of Australasia v. the Minister of State for the Navy. </para>
          <para>The agreement that this Government has made with the ACTU and the employers will not allow the shop steward to do the things that are necessary for him to do, and if he continues to do the things which the agreement calls upon him to do then this decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Commissioner</inline> McCreadie - which in the terms of the Act as it now stands is probably in accordance with the technical provisions of the Act - would continue to apply. No shop steward or union delegate in the future could be expected to carry out the role required of him under  the  provisions of the new agreement unless he is guaranteed proper protection from victimisation. For these reasons we will oppose the second reading of the Bill. We will move our amendments in Committee and if they are rejected we will vote against  the  third reading. </para>

          <para class="block">In the Bill we are now debating the Government at long last lays stress on conciliation and negotiation before proceeding with sanctions. The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> in his second reading speech said:   . . before action can be taken to use the new sanctions process the Commission will attempt to resolve the issues that lie between the parties. I believe that the existing sanctioning process which involves the use of the Court&#39;s injunction making powers under section 109 and its power to punish for contempt under section 111, are no longer appropriate or desirable.  1  believe they suffer from two main deficiencies. Firstly, there is the immediacy of their availability. Secondly, they did not allow the Court to take hold of the dispute between the parties and endeavour lo assist the parlies to resolve that dispute.  lt has taken the Minister and the Government many years to realise that the main objective of this Act is to encourage conciliation with a view to amicable agreement. It is doubtful whether these amendments will achieve the objective which the Government claims is its aim. </para>
          <para>The Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party have been urging for years that the sanction provisions in sections 109 and 1 1 1 should be repealed, but we did not want them repealed and then re-inserted in a different section of the Act, as is being done, in effect, so far as the amendment of section 109 is concerned. Some amendments of the Act were made in 1965 which provided for a cooling off period, but as we said during that debate, the amendments did not go far enough and they turned out to be useless. This could well be the case with the present amendments. We moved in 1965 for the repeal of the injunction and related contempt provisions. Had our amendments been accepted we would not have been faced with the disastrous industrial trouble of May 1968. A ray of light appeared when the Government did not insert these penal provisions, as it was contemplating doing, in the Public Service Arbitration Act when it was amended during March 1969. During that debate and a debate to increase the number of judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, which took place at about the same time, speakers on this side of the House again urged the repeal of the penal provisions. The offending sections have created more strikes than they have settled. Consequently the reason for their insertion in the Act has proved abortive and their repeal is long overdue. When the so called cure prolongs the disease surely it is thru1 to try a new cure. The Government claims it is trying something new on this occasion but it appears to us not to be a cure hut merely a palliative. </para>
          <para>Some employers have been sheltering behind these punitive provisions and their actions have been responsible for creating and extending disputes rather than bringing about a settlement. One would think that the inflicting of penalties was an end in itself, ignoring entirely that the end is to settle industrial disputes as quickly as possible and not to extend them by the imposition of severe penalties. It has to be realised that the Act we are dealing with is the Conciliation and Arbitration Act Conciliation comes first. It is placed before arbitration in its importance in the Act. The placing of the word &#39;conciliation&#39; before the word &#39;arbitration&#39; is clearly significant. The Government, the employers and a lot of other people have been ignoring this, and this is the first admission by the Government that conciliation at least comes first. </para>
          <para>The Act provides for conciliators and commissioners but it doss not say that the whole process of conciliation should be done exclusively by them. Section 31 of the Act provides for the likelihood that the parties to an industrial dispute may themselves arrive at agreement to govern their industrial relationships. The section does noi say anything about the way in which they should do it. Section 32 of the Act goes on to say that if no agreement is arrived at the Commission shall determine the dispute. The strike by Qantas employees earl;, in 1964 was settled by an outside mediator. This was special arrangement and it served its purpose; the dispute was settled. That should always be the aim. Much more con ciliation is required. Conciliation means bringing the paries to a dispute together into harmony so that their differences mav be settled amicably. </para>
          <para>Some sections of the existing Act operate against conciliation. There is a bad section in the Act, and I refer to section 31 (3.) which provides, inter aiia, that the arbitration authority may refuse to certify an agreement if il is of the opinion that &#39;it is not in the public interest thai the agreement should be certified&#39;. Who is to define public interest? The words &#39;public interest&#39; mean a lol of different things to a lol of different people. Surely it is ;n the public interest to settle a strike or an industrial dispute as quickly as possible. Negotiation and con ciliation should not necessarily cease when the commissioners finally arrive al a deci sion. There are still avenues open for furthe negotiations </para>
          <para>The Government and the employers must realise thai the Commission sets down mini mum standards. After the minimum standards have been established we come to what has been referred to by the  President  of the Commission as the collective bargaining area The  President  in his I96f&#62; report said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has long been obvious that arbitration foi minimum payments and bargaining for  ove  award payments must co-exist in this community </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to say in that report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The problems and difficulties should noi obscure the fact that there is no real incompatibility in the mutual existence of a system prescribing minimum rates by arbitration tribunals and of bargaining on occasion about over-award payments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Some of the employers refuse to negotiate and consequently the conciliation function of the Act fails to operate. There is a certain amount of one-sidedness in our method of controlling wages and industrial conditions. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to wages. This Government believes that the price of labour should be controlled and all the forces of our legal machinery are used to prevent the workers from putting their own price for their labour. The unions have to go to the arbitration tribunals and argue their case and support it by evidence. The employers present their case in opposition to any increase. The workers are placed in a difficult position. They have to abide by the decision. But what happens then? The employers increase their prices to cover the increased cost of wages. They do this at their own whim. Decisions are arrived at in private - without evidence - without a case being heard in opposition. Often they combine with other firms selling a similar product and collectively fix the price of similar articles. As a matter of fact, the Arbitration Commission in its 1964 basic wage decision emphasised that there was no control of other incomes and &#39;no overall authoritative control of prices&#39;. Increases gained by workers to offset already increased costs can be swallowed up by the employer merely increasing his prices. Those who take huge sums by way of profits and interest payments from the national income take them without having te justify their actions to anyone. No charge is ever made that these companies are taking too much from the national income and thereby endangering the economy and causing production and living costs to rise. </para>
          <para>Is it any wonder that workers become dissatisfied and disgruntled and threaten to strike in order to gel their wrongs righted? Workers have a right to complain about the time lag thai lakes place to have their grievances heard and remedied. At times employers deliberately lodge appeals against decisions of commissioners in order to delay paying increased salaries or giving improved conditions. A glaring example is the equal pay case which was deliberately delayed by reference to the High Court. The employers know that each day&#39;s delay means the saving of millions of dollars in the long run if the equal pay decision is favourable to the workers. The strike weapon is not illegal in Great Britain or the United States. Neither is it illegal here. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not prohibit strikes. It did so up until 1930 when the prohibition was removed. It is true the Commission has power to include in its award a ban on strikes. That is where the trouble starts. I emphasise to the House that one cannot expect a system of industrial arbitration to eliminate entirely strikes and other forms of direct action. If anyone believes that, they are attributing to arbitration a function which it cannot possibly fulfil. </para>
          <para>Laws are much more easily applied by the State to individuals for the settlement of disputes than they are to exercise compulsion over powerful organisations such as a trade union. This is a powerful section of the community. A huge majority of people accept the fact that the common law and criminal law courts are enforcing a law which they agree with. But the field of industrial conflict is different. No sei principle exists as to what is fair, reasonable or just. The arbitration system deals with questions on which the community as a whole is divided into 2 camps. Workers and employers have their own views on what is reasonable or just. There is no doubt about the value and importance of our conciliation and arbitration system but it is ridiculous to think that it could usher in a reign of peace in industrial relations. No-one will deny the value and importance of international law. but conflicts arise between States which are so severe thai all observance of the law is swept away. Hundreds of issues arise which are successfully settled by our arbitration courts but they cannot settle all of them. </para>
          <para>The system would be strengthened if this Government accepted the reality of the situation. Issues and conflicts exist which are so acute that no court could hope to impose an acceptable solution. I suggest to the Attorney-General that the deletion of the injunction and contempt provisions of this Act does not mean that there are no other avenues open to the Commission to deal with unions if they feel disposed to deal with them. Section 119 is available. This section is used when the courts want to discipline employers. They turn to sections 109 and 111 when they want to discipline the unions. These sect:ons contain the contempt provisions. Section &#93;43U )(h) contains provisions for the deregistration of a union under certain conditions. Since 1958 industrial action has been included as one of the grounds upon which the court can act. Deregistration can apply also where an organisation has wilfully neglected to obey an order of the court. A new ground, which was added in 1958, provides for deregistration for continued breach or non-observance of an award or for an organisation&#39;s continued failure to ensure that its members comply with an award. Prior to 1958 the court had discretion to deregister, but the section now provides that upon one of the grounds being made out the court &#39;shall deregister unless it considers to do so could be unjust&#39;. This in itself is a severe punishment because it deprives the organisation and its members of the benefit or protection of the award; the award ceases to have any force or effect. Previously <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Higgins held the view that deregistration left the award in operation but un ons could not take action for breaches of the award. In my view, and in the view of reasonable people, the power to deregister should be sufficient in itself to discipline a union if that is regarded as necessary. </para>
          <para> However other avenues are available to the Commiss on in the present Act. Section 41 (c) entitles the Commission to fix maximum penalties for a breach or nonobservance of an award. The penalty is $200 for an organisation and $20 for a member. The section with which we are concerned now, namely section 1 19, relates fo the enforcement of orders and awards and provides for maximum penalties being imposed by magistrates in local courts. As 1 said a short while ago, this is the section under which employers who offend are punished. Section 62 provides for the cancellation or suspension of an award if it appears that an organisation entitled to the benefits of an award has committed a breach or non-observance of the Act, an award or a court order, or that a substantial number of members of an organisation refused to accept employment either at all or in accordance with existing awards or for any other reason&#39;. The words &#39;for any other reason&#39; are broad enough to cover a multitude of sins. </para>
          <para>So we see that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act there are disciplinary powers possessed by the court apart from the penal provisons which the Minister still claims the right to use under the name of sanctions and which we suggest should be repealed. Surely what 1 have said indicates that there is sufficient power available in the existing legislation without the use of the penal provsions. it is psychologically bad to have the penal provisions in the Act. Better industrial relations are not possible while they exist. I repeat what the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> has said: We oppose the Bill and support the repeal of the sanction provisions in the existing Act. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you and other honourable members may think that this debate has taken a somewhat unusual course. The speech made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> was notable for its lack of any substantial reference to the fundamental provisions of this Bill which, of course, arc those which substitute new sanction provisions of a more moderate character for what were thought to be, and with justification in the light of evidence, the rather draconian sanction provisions that are enshrined in sections 109 and the following two or three sections of the Act. I was most interested in the course followed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh in the debate this afternoon. He made scant reference to the undoubted fact that the Bill proposes an amendment of an enlightened character to the sanctions provisions of the Act. Instead of dwelling upon this fact, which from the viewpoint of his Party is of course an inconvenient one, he treated us to a long disquisition upon the alleged iniquities of section 5 of the principal Act. </para>

          <para>I do not stand here this afternoon as an apologist for section 5 in its present form. It would be idle to deny that section 5 could be improved. But that is not the subject we are here to debate this afternoon. We are here to debate the amendments that the Bill will make to the sanctions provisions of the Act, these provisions which have been the subject of so much controversy in the world of industry and in the trade union movement. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member suggests by interjection that section 5 could have been amended on the run, on the wing as it were. 1 am not the Minister responsible for the administration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but I think it is fairly clear from the documents which the honourable member for Hindmarsh read out this afternoon that amendments to section 5 of the Act appear to be under the close scrutiny of my colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden).</inline> I know it is easy always to complain that it takes time - and too much time - to get what are thought to be anomalies in statutes remedied or amended. One is used to hearing that complaint. The honourable member for Hindmarsh would be one of the first to recognise that the difficulties in relation to amendments of statutes are caused by a shortage of draftsmen. As he knows, the Government has taken steps in statutory form to remedy that shortage by having passed in this session the Parliamentary Counsel Bill, which comes into force today. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What surprised me about the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh was that while he railed against section 5 and drew attention to what he claimed to be manifest defects in il we have the extraordinary fact - extraordinary in the light of his complaints - that although the Opposition has proposed a number of amendments to the Bill it has not proposed a single amendment to section 5 of the principal Act There is nothing in either the short title or the long title of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1970 which would preclude the honourable member for Hindmarsh from proposing an amendment to section 5. I take it that the honourable member would consider it no discourtesy to him if I drew attention to what is probably very obvious; namely, in formulating the amendments which are proposed to be moved in Committee this afternoon, the honourable gentleman had resort, and properly so, to the services of one of the parliamentary draftsmen. I do nol want to know what went on between the parliamentary draftsman and the honourable member for Hindmarsh, but I would have thought that if the complaints that have been voiced today are as deeply felt as the honourable member wanted to persuade us they are he might have invoked a little further the services of the draftsman to draw some amendments to that section. But not so. No amendment to section 5 is proposed. </para>
          <para>What is the lesson to be drawn from this? I do not want to be hard on the honourable member for Hindmarsh at this hour after long days of sittings. Tiredness perhaps produces charity. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member is very difficult to fool. I think the lesson to be drawn from the approach adopted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh is simply this: In order to avoid a discussion upon what is a very enlightened measure, namely, a modification of the sanctions provisions, he tried to lead the House down a rather sterile sidetrack. It would have been much more interesting, I suggest, for the House, for industry and for the trade union movement if we heard a little more from the honourable member as to his Party&#39;s attitude towards the newly proposed sanctions provisions which are substituted for the old contempt provisions which are set out in section 18. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb)</inline> in his contribution to the debate did not really grasp the principal question raised by this Bill, that is, the appropriateness and the suitability of the new sanctions provisions. He made a few passing references to the question. I thought he was rather guarded and his speech demonstrates the difficulty that the Opposition has in doing anything but refraining from criticism of the newly proposed sanctions provisions. I doubt whether the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions will be deliriously delighted when he reads of the contributions to the debate made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Stirling because we did not hear either of those honourable members come out and make an outright denunciation of the sanctions provisions in any form. Of course, that has been the refrain persistently indulged in by certain prominent people in the trade union movement, including the  President  of the ACTU. I do not criticise him for putting his view. He is fully entitled to do that. But. of course, the Government and the Parliament are entitled to judge as to the correctness of such a view and to my mind there is no doubt whatsoever as to what the judgment must be. </para>
          <para>No system of conciliation and arbitration in relation to industrial disputes can work unless at the ultimate stage there is some sort of sanction against disobedience of awards. A law which becomes unenforceable becomes meaningless and in truth no law at all. Therefore, 1 think this is recognised sub silentio by the Opposition this afternoon; this is implicit in the attitude that its leading speakers have taken in this debate. In their hearts they know that no system of industrial arbitration will ever be workable unless sanctions are available as a matter of last resort. I refer here not only to sanctions against employees or employees organisations but equally importantly to sanctions against employers and employers&#39; organisations. I can never understand the attitude - I think that most people who would like to be considered as having commonsense can never understand the a Kit tide - which is taken up by prominent people in the trade union movement. Again, they are entitled to take up the attitude just as I am entitled to criticise it. The attitude that there must be no sanctions or penal provisions applicable to employees but that sanctions or penal provisions should nevertheless remain and apply against employers seems to overlook the well known principle that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. But I believe that at bottom we can say that it has been revealed in this debate this afternoon that the Opposition, in the person of its 2 leading speakers - led, of course, by the shadow Minister for Labour and National Service - recognises that so far as the sanctions provisions are concerned the game is up. </para>
          <para>It is recognised implicitly that the old sanctions provisions - depending upon bans clause, injunction and then contempt procedure - have been replaced well and in an enlightened way by carefully thought out new sanctions provisions which will elevate the processes of conciliation at a final stage before enforcement action is allowed to be taken. The critical feature of this Bill is that it elevates in importance the process of conciliation in the attempt to settle what might be described as the ultimate or critical stages of an industrial dispute. This is done by the interposition, as required by the Bill, of a presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission before enforcement action, by way of a prosecution for breach of a compliance provision in an award, can be taken. </para>
          <para>That is not the only enlightened feature of this Bill. It is also important, I believe, that the House should observe that the penalty for daily disobedience or infringement of an industrial award is reduced by half - from a daily maximum of $1,000 to a daily maximum of $500. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, when he was dealing with this question of the amount of penalties, overlooked the very important feature that the amounts expressed in the Bill are, just as were the amounts expressed in the Act, maximums and not the only amounts that can be levied by way of penalty. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member says so. All I say in reply is that, whilst 1 have not the statistics in front of me. my recollection would not accord with the honourable member&#39;s statement made to me across the table. I believe that it will be found that in dealing with contempt applications under the old provisions - the provisions that are proposed to be replaced by the new provisions - the Commonwealth Industrial Court did exercise a good measure of discretion as to the amount of the fine. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Of course, in the light of recent history it was not a sufficient discretion because to exercise a discretion as to the amount of the fine does not achieve the objective that the Government sees as an objective necessary to be achieved, namely, that before enforcement procedures are taken at all there should be some procedure by which the merits of a dispute can be looked into and fully examined by a presidential member of the Commission so that - one can well imagine this happening - in a case in which there has been a stoppage of work in disobedience of a bans clause or a compliance clause in the relevant award, a presidential member of the Commission, perhaps, can mould his approach to the case so as to render it impracticable or impossible for an employer, whose conduct in relation to the events giving rise to the stoppage has not been altogether meritorious, to have resort to the sanctions provisions. That is the sort of objective - a very important objective it is - that the new sanction provisions are designed to obtain. </para>
          <para>Let us be clear: Most people of responsibility - it would be unfair to use the absolute term &#39;all&#39; and to say &#39;all people of responsibility&#39;- on both sides of politics and on both sides of what we still regard as the industrial fence - labour and employers - recognise in their heart of hearts that an effective system of industrial operation cannot be attained without some form of sanctions. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member says that he did not have time. He had a lot of time. In fact, I think he took 30 minutes of his allotted 45 minutes in dealing with section 5 of the Act which he has not even troubled to deal with by way of amendment. If that is not, if I may use a polite term, a little smokescreen, I do not know what is. I was going to say, before my honourable friend&#39;s friendly interruption, that most people with a responsible attitude - I am not suggesting that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has not a responsible attitude; he is fully entitled to his view - on either side of the industrial and political fences know and recognise in their heart of hearts that sanctions must be available if an effective system of conciliation and arbitration is to operate. I refer to sanctions at the end of the road - the end of the road that nobody wants to reach or should want to reach, but nevertheless the end of the road which is reached in the cut and thrust, as it sometimes is, of industrial life. </para>

          <para>The need for sanctions was recognised expressly by a great figure in the industrial world, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Albert</inline> Monk, in 1963. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Monk</inline> is a man whose views are entitled to the utmost respect. Because of his conduct and performance as  President  of the Austraiian Council of Trade Unions for so many years, he is entitled to our warmest and deepest respect.

          <para>He is not the only person on the Labor side of politics or on the employees&#39; side of industry who has similar views. Let us not forget that the contempt procedure for enforcing an award is to be found, I think, in its original form in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1947, which was introduced by the Chifley Government. Under the 1947 Act, the penalty for contempt of court constituted by breach of injunction enjoining disobedience to an award was unlimited. The hour is late. We all want to go home. I think that I have spoken long enough - or probably too long. 1 therefore conclude by expressing my support for the Bill. I simply say this: lt is not of itself the millenium. It will be a most valuable measure if both sides - that is, employers and labour - recognise the worth of its provisions and try in a spirit of mutual cooperation, forebearance and tolerance to make it work. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to make it quite clear now, if I have not already made it clear, that there is on the part of the Opposition an outright denunciation of the sanctions against unions and against people who have only their labour to sell. We are completely and utterly opposed to the penal provisions of the Act, as the Australian Council of Trade Unions is opposed to them. There is a good reason why there should not be sanctions or penalties against those who have only their labour to sell. This stems from the fact that as a general rule the economic position of the individual worker is too weak for him to hold his own in the unequal contest for a fair share of what he produces. I quote now from a judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Higgins in the Engine Drivers case contained in the fifth volume of the Commonwealth Arbitration reports at page 27. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Higgins said: </para>

          <para class="block">During the hearing of the waterside workers case on 9th December 1919 his Honour said he adhered to the view that he had expressed in the 1917 waterside workers case when he had stated that it was not a breach of an award for an employee to refuse to accept work if he did not like the conditions. The minimum rate was the lowest rate at which an employer could employ men but the whole area beyond the minimum wage was open to bargaining between employers and men. The right to bargain is meaningless without the right to strike. Even with this right preserved the worker is at a decided disadvantage. To strike is to starve. The power of the employer to withhold bread is a much more effective weapon than the power of the employee to refuse to labour. In the great maritime strike of 1890 it was starvation that drove the workers back to work. Starvation and now hire purchase as well stand on the side of the employer. The industrial tribunals are on the side of the employer. The law also is on his side and the court stands savagely behind the law. The minimum wage has become the maximum wage and the maximum penalty has become the minimum penalty for those who seek to get above the minimum wage. </para>
          <para>We live in a society in which the wage and salary earner has lost the most basic of all human rights, which is the right to decide whether and on what terms he will allow another to use his labour power. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr P.</inline><inline font-style="italic">i.</inline> Clarey, M.P., who was at one time the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was correct when he declared that the right to strike is the one thing which distinguishes the free man from the slave. The &#39;call-out&#39; is the life blood of unionism because it is the only weapon with which organised labour can defend itself against the greedy employers and biased industrial commissioners. Rob the unions of this weapon and you rob them of their justification for existence. What could be more unjust than a law which fixes the price of the only thing which a worker has to sell - his labour power - but which places no restraint upon the price of the things he has to buy. The savage penalties imposed upon unions whenever they attempt to meet rising costs contrasts with the absolute freedom with which the employing class may fix the price of the things they have to sell. </para>

          <para class="block">Chief Judge Dethridge ot the Arbitration Court reduced the pastoral award by 20%. In post-war years wages were arbitrarily fixed at levels far below what would be obtainable through collective bargaining in a free market. Arbitration has never given more than organised labour has been strong enough to take. Its chief claim to fame has been its capacity to prevent the trade unions from taking what the market would have given. </para>
          <para>There is now no need for an employer to conciliate. He can afford to stand flat footed against all demands for wage justice because he knows that arbitration will never order him to grant that which a free trade union movement could obtain by direct action. </para>

          <para class="block">From 1930 until at least 1947 there were no penal clauses at all. Occasionally, but very occasionally, provision was made in awards imposing obligations on organisations. In those cases the penalty then provided under the legislation, namely a fine of &#163;100, could be imposed for a breach. The offences would not be continuing offences incurring daily penalties, as is now the case and as is proposed in certain circumstances in the Bill which is now before the House. The first occasion on which penal powers reappeared was in 1947. This happened as a result of a 40-hour week case. When the 40-hour week was introduced the Arbitration Court ordered that reasonable overtime should be worked and that an organisation should not be concerned in any ban on overtime. This was said to be a temporary measure only. The breach of this provision could make an organisation liable to a penalty; but the penalty was &#163;100. 1 believe we now ought lo consider the excuse sometimes put up by people that the laws of arbitration, and the penalties attached to those laws, should apply with equal force to employers and employees. Let us examine this statement for validity. Firstly, let us examine the impact upon BHP, or CSR, General Motors, the Ford Mo:or Co., ICI, Chrysler, AGM, Comalco or the Dunlop Rubber Co. </para>

            <para>-  Let us consider the impact that a $1,000 penalty would have on these companies as compared with the same penalty on a shop steward or a union official. In case anyone thinks otherwise, union officials, with one or two exceptions, are very poorly paid. Compare the impact on the manager of a company whose company will pay the $1,000 fine without so much as blinking an eyelid with a similar penally upon a rank and file member working in industry. It is ridiculous lo suggest that a man working in industry for the wage obtainable under the awards in this country should be made to pay the same penalty as a rich employer such as those 1 mentioned or, for that matter, any employer who owns industry and employs labour. Such a proposition should not fall from the lips of anybody who has his sanity, lt is unreal to suggest that a rich employer is being treated fairly when he is being made lo pay the same penalty as an ordinary worker in industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I point out again that whereas it is not the practice of the Commonwealth Industrial Court to impose heavy penalties upon employers, it invariably imposes the maximum penalty upon employee organisations. I can never forget the look of smug satisfaction on the face of Dunphy one day when I saw him impose a $1,000 penalty upon some trade unions which were merely striking for a better deal. The situation in the Industrial Court is that the Court never attempts in most cases to distinguish between the kind of circumstances that led to the dispute. The penalty was nearly always $1,000. It did not matter whether the strike arose out of justified provocation; it was $1,000. It did not matter whether the strike was without justification; it was still $1,000. </para>
          <para>Indeed, the judges of the Industrial Court, to their eternal discredit, have been known to refuse a union advocate the right to state a case for the mitigation of costs or fines. Such advocates were immediately sat down and told: &#39;You have committed contempt of the court. Do not come here and try to justify it.&#39; Whether out of whim or humour, or for whatever reason it is that motivates judges when they are sitting on the bench, they usually apply the maximum penalty. 1 do not think the penalties they applied were proper. I know that the unions concerned which now owe the $38,000 will not pay the outstanding fines and I know that this Government is determined to cause a stoppage in industry in order to try to collect them. Here was an opportunity for the Government to wipe out the outstanding fines in the same way as it has wiped the contempt order currently applicable. But no. In order to continue the ferment of discontent which exists in industry today, the Government has deliberately set out to provoke an industrial stoppage in order to bring industry grinding to a halt The Government seems to get satisfaction from handling industrial disputes in this way. </para>
          <para>We are now passing through a period in Australia in which there is a surplus of jobs. It is a seller&#39;s market now and the unions are not prepared any longer to take it on the chin. No matter what members of the Government may think, sitting in the padded chairs of the Cabinet room, in isolation from the reality of the factories, despite their feelings of grandeur and their belief that they can do these things, I issue the warning tonight that if the Government is wise it will not attempt to force payment of the fines. If it does it will bring industry to a halt. </para>
          <para>The workers have every right to apply the same principle as the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd applied when quite arbitrarily it increased the price of steel by 3.7%. This, mark you, was done immediately following a year in which the company had made a record profit. That increase was arbitrarily imposed upon the Australian community. It is of no use for the Government continually to blame high wages for high prices. High prices always precede high wages. The demand for increased wages comes only as a result of increased prices already established as a consequence of the lack o control of prices of manufacturers&#39; products. I am sorry that I do not have more time to develop the theme I have started. 1 repeat that in my opinion it is quite wrong that those of us on this side of the chamber who feel keenly about this subject should be compelled to restrict our remarks to a timetable which threatens to prevent even my moving the amendments I would like to move. I will not be calling for a division, on this clause but I have indicated clearly that I am utterly opposed to the clause, and so is the Opposition. The fact that a division was not called for on the clause is because we face the threat of the guillotine, which may prevent even the moving of amendments that we will later seek to move in dealing with the clauses. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr BRYANT</inline>(Wills) &#91;5.3SJ - I wish to place on record my thoughts about the approach of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> to the sanctions, representing as I do an industrial area in which people reside who feel the first winds that blow when industrial disputes arise. I believe that there is confusion in the minds of people who designed this legislation and the people who have been administering it for so long as to what are ils objectives. I do not believe that the objectives to be sought when industrial disputes occur include the process of law. We are not seeking a process of law but a system of arrangements between people who perform different functions in the community. Now law will solve the problem. You will not produce industrial peace by even the most beautifully drawn piece of parliamentary draftsmanship. It just will not succeed. The continuing flow of evidence in relation to arbitral proceed ings in this country and the consequent imposition of sanctions shows that they are an exercise in futility. Time after time the courts impose sanctions. Time after time the unions refuse to pay, and indeed, they are likely to continue to refuse. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General has said thai the law has no sense if it is unenforceable. The fact is that in recent times it has been impossible to enforce the penal provisions of the law. lt is therefore an exercise in futility to continue with them. While we tolerate these provisions in our legislation Australia will not be a democracy. I believe that a fundamental civil right is involved, that the rights of some people are involved very deeply and the rights of others are involved indirectly. We impose upon one area of the community sanctions that we do not impose upon other areas. 1 believe that to be an exercise of executive power against people who are least able to resist it. What do we mean by it? The Attorney-General talks about sanctions as though the law embodied some implied duty to the community. He is implying that some parts of the community - in this case the workers in industry who happen to be in an industrial dispute - have a duly to the community. What sort of a duty do they have? They have a duty to work. Why have they a duty to work? Why have they a duty to go to work on terms to which they object? It is against the general attitude of the Australian community. </para>
          <para>The Government has just attempted to find some alternative to national service. We have decided to reject the national service system, but it is interesting that the denunciation of the idea of forcing people to work in a form of national service came from all quarters. Even people on the other side for whose democratic attitudes I have no respect whatsoever have forced the Government to change its view. The community as a whole - the leader writers in the newspapers and all sorts of peoples - rejects the suggestion that we have a right to force people in this community to work. I think we have enshrined it in the Constitution and in the social service amendments carried back in 1946 or 1947 - &#39;subject to the fact that there shall be no civil conscription&#39;, I think the words are. In other words, the Government is saying that one particular group of people have a duty to the community; they have a duty to work. We reject that view. We believe that each side has its equal rights and neither of them shall be transcended by the rights of the community in this instance. </para>
          <para>I am always reminded in these debates of the words that one can find in Mussolini&#39;s The Fundamental Laws of Fascism&#39;. It would be instructive, I think, for those members opposite who have been prepared to stay here and discuss and consider this legislation that is being carried through in their name, to turn to The Fundamental Laws of Fascism&#39; and see how those duties are described by Mussolini in that work. I believe the House as a whole should reject the suggestion of penal clauses. I do not believe that the individual has a duty to the state that transcends the state&#39;s responsibility to him. I believe the powers not only implied but actually applied in this legislation are of the very basis of the Fascist philosophy, and they ought to be rejected. </para>
          <para>I understand there are very few countries that have such pieces of legislation. This afternoon the House should reject the Bill. Honourable members opposite who have remained to do what they consider to be their duty should consider this deeply. Those who have departed from this place and are allowing this measure to be passed in their name ought to pause and look at the situation. There will be no solution to industrial situations by the use of penal clauses or sanctions. I do not know what the answer is and I suppose most people in the community - large employers and so on - do not know what the answers are: but one of them is the working conditions; another is security; another is the actual salary or wage involved. 1 was struck on a visit to Sweden a few years ago by the actual arrangements inside the factory I saw. I visited a light engineering concern. You could have eaten off the floor. Every man worked at his lathe and there was tons of space around him. The whole atmosphere was pleasant, hygienic and, I would say. the kind of place in which a person could work with some comfort. One only has to visit an industrial establishment in my own electoral district to see that conditions in such places are to our shame, as is the case in most of Australia. Many places, particularly those engaged in heavy industry, are unfit for people to work in. It is always instructive to me that the worst relationships are in the industries where the management has been tough and the working conditions are poor. In other instances there are not only happy relationships but also what one might call a close friendly relationship between the management and the workers. I could take some honourable members opposite to visit some similar establishments. Even at election times the way in which the management treats its workers is manifest. When I turn up at a large industrial establishment to a political meeting called by the shop stewards I find the men who do the work and make the profits for the employers have to sit outside on the ground and in the dust, I am affronted on their behalf and on behalf of the community. </para>
          <para>When one goes to a place, is invited inside by the management, and taken to the area where the people are having their lunch, one can see that there is a different kind of attitude, an attitude of respect. Until management accords the proper respect to people who work in factories - the same type of respect as is accorded to any other equals - there will not be industrial peace. When people who are treated in an undignified manner and are asked to work in conditions that are a denial of the standard of life we expect in this community strike against governments or owners or anyone else in these matters, I am on their side, as I believe a large section of the Australian community also to be. Until the Government - or what there is left of it at present - applies itself to the human questions involved in the industrial situation, there will not be industrial peace. I appeal to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> to apply to the industrial area some of the civil rights principles that I often hear him enunciate, and see whether for once we cannot set up a standard for the rest of the world to look at in this area, instead of getting out the knout, the whip or the sanction. </para>

            <para>- I take it that most honourable members on the other side will vote against the amendment. They have no understanding of what it involves. They are following the traditional habit of their Parties in pressing legislation through this place. The question of costs in industrial legislation is of vital importance, particularly to many small unions. Quite a number of unions have only 2,000 or 3,000 members, each of whom pays $5 or $10 a year in fees. After these unions maintain an office they reach the stage where it is impossible for them to go to court secure in the knowledge that they will have enough money to pay costs or to comply with any other sanctions imposed on them. I protest in this Parliament against the manner in which the Government is treating the unions. In all the years that I have been here, I have seen few more miserable performances. </para>

              <para>- It concerns the question of costs. Surely I am discussing the question before the Parliament. One might ask whether the Parliament is giving it serious consideration and whether it is being carried by the appropriate numbers. The Committee is dealing with a matter of substantial social importance, one that has given rise to many difficulties in recent times, and I submit that it is deserving of proper consideration. I put on record that this is a most miserable performance on the part of the Government Parties. </para>

            <para>- We of the Opposition are completely and utterly opposed to clause 18 of the Bill which proposes to write into section 119 of the Act the savage penalties which are set out in proposed sub-section 1 (d.).I just want to say a few words on this and then we will take the final vote. It is unfortunate that in relation to these penal provisions at least one of the judges has chosen to have the onus of proof shifted to the person charged. I take the case in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy dealt with a strike by the Victorian railway workers. The only offence alleged to have been committed by 1 union was that 12 of its members were absent from work on the day in question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Dunphy said: </para>

          <para class="block">So there we have the extraordinary ruling from a judge which shifts the onus from the person laying the charge to the person charged. I regret that I have to leave out so much of what I would otherwise have said, but 1 must say this much about the penal powers: As I have said, the penal powers were removed in 1 930 and have been reintroduced largely by judge-made law. There has been no deliberate enactment by Parliament of a properly considered system and, indeed, parliamentary action has consisted of patching up gaps which have appeared or giving apparent relaxations which, in reality, meant nothing. That is what we are doing now. It is obviously time that the powers were looked at independently of the courts&#39; decisions and of the system which has been built up by the courts. When that is done, the matter is examined in its historical perspective, it will be abundantly clear that the steady growth in penal provisions and in their use has indeed been like the effect of a drug upon a drug taker - the more penal powers there have been, the more there has come to be a reliance on them, although the years from 1930 to 1947 show that the arbitration system can work and, indeed, work better without penal provisions. That is all 1 have time to say. I make it clear that we oppose the Bill and will vote against it at the third reading stage. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">With the concurrence Of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard my second reading speech. It reads: </para>
          <para>This is a Bill for an Act to amend certain provisions of the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act 1959-1962, which prescribes the liability of airline operators in the event of accidents occurring in the course of international and domestic aircraft operations. The right to recover damages arising from travel on international flights is primarily regulated by the Warsaw Convention made in 1929 and the Hague Protocol to that Convention made in 1955. Australia is one of many countries participating in these international agreements, which are given the force of law in Australia by the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act. In addition, Part IV of the Act applies similar conditions to operations by the holders of domestic airline licences, and it is in this regard that the Government proposes the amendments incorporated in this Bill. The basic Warsaw principle, as applied to Australian domestic operations under Part IV of the Act, is that a carrier is liable for assessed damages sustained by reason of the death or personal injury of a passenger resulting from an aircraft accident. This liability of the carrier exists whether the accident was due to negligence on the part of the carrier or not, but the court may adjust the damages payable if it is proved that the passenger caused or contributed to the damages. The Act limits the liability of the carrier in respect of each passenger to $15,000. </para>
          <para>This limit of liability is approximately equivalent to the one specified for international operations in the Hague Protocol of 1955. In recent years the International Civil Aviation Organisation has been studying whether the limit of liability and other provisions of the Warsaw Convention should be reviewed, and it is now proposed to hold an international conference early in 1971 for (his purpose. The conference will have before it a proposal to raise the. international limit of liability to $89,000. In the meantime, following indications by the United States Government that it was dissatisfied with the existing limit in relation to international services to and from that country, the airlines operating those services agreed with the United States authorities, as an interim measure, that they would accept a limit of liability of $52,000 for international passengers embarking or disembarking in the United States or passing through that country. </para>
          <para>The Government gave careful consideration to these moves in the international aviation world when assessing what would be an appropriate limit of carriers&#39; liability for Australian domestic air services in present circumstances. The figures mentioned are related primarily to economic conditions in the United States, where personal incomes and damages awarded in accident cases are at a much higher level than they are here. Accordingly, the Government concluded that an increase of this order in the Australian domestic limit could not be justified at the present time. As the nominal average weekly earnings of adult males in Australia have approximately doubled since 1955, when the basis for the existing limit was established, the Government proposes that the same change be made in this limit of liability, that is to say, an increase from $15,000 to $30,000. This will cost the airlines some $250,000 per annum in additional insurance premiums. If the proposed international conference results in a new convention or protocol or carriers&#39; liability, the Government will consider whether it is appropriate for Australia to become a party to it, in which case a suitable proposal will be submitted to the Parliament. This will also provide an opportunity to review again the domestic limit of liability in the light of what is decided internationally. </para>
          <para>I should emphasise that the maximum amounts of compensation specified by the Act, as well as by the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol, are not automatic entitlements. An injured passenger, or the dependants of a deceased passenger, claiming compensation from an airline whose aircraft is involved in an accident, must prove that damage has been suffered by reason of the accident, and the amount of damages is assessed in accordance with the ordinary principles of law. When the assessed damages are less than the maximum amount mentioned in the Act, they are recoverable in full. Otherwise, the carrier&#39;s liability is limited to that amount. I would also point out that these arrangements and limits refer only to the liability of the air carrier to the passenger or his dependant. They do not require the carrier to insure against this liability, although as a matter of . prudence this is normally done, nor do they prevent a passenger from insuring his life or person quite independently for any additional amount he chooses. There are similar provisions in the Act relating to damage or loss of passengers&#39; luggage. The present limit of carriers&#39; liability for registered baggage, that is baggage checked in with the airline and carried in the aircraft hold, is $200, and that for hand baggage, carried into the aircraft by the passenger, is $20. The Government proposes that these limits be raised to S300 and $30 respectively. Here again, these are maximum amounts recoverable on proof of damages, but if the luggage of a passenger is worth more than these amounts he has ready access to insurance facilities and can cover himself against loss for the full value. </para>
          <para>As I have indicated earlier, the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act applies only to the carriage of passengers and baggage in aircraft operated by the holders of airline licences under the Air Navigation Regulations. This includes passengers carried on airline charter flights as well as on their regular services. The rights of passengers on air taxi flights, charter flights and joy rides conducted by the holders of charter licences only, however, depend on common law and the terms of the contract between the passenger and the carrier. Commuter service operators hold charter licences and have been exempted from holding airline licences under powers conferred on the Director-General of Civil Aviation by the Air Navigation Regulations. In granting such exemptions, the DirectorGeneral has required the operators to contract with their commuter passengers to accept liability for death or injury to the same extent as if Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act applied to the carriage. This is not an entirely satisfactory method of achieving adequate protection for commuter passengers. With the general charter operators, it is common to contract out of all liability for death or injury to passengers by including appropriate conditions on the tickets. Whether such provisions are legally effective may be open to question, but on the face of things many passengers carried by charter operators may have no redress in the event of accidents. </para>
          <para>The Government cannot see any justification for treating passengers of the airlines and the charter firms any differently in respect to the carriers&#39; liability arrangements, and the Bill includes amendments which will apply the Act to all chaner flights and commuter services subject to the Act. As with the airlines, this will involve the charter operators in higher insurance costs. On this last point, as will be seen from a perusal of Part IV of the Act. for constitutional reasons its provisions are not applicable to intrastate services, except in the case of those operated by Trans- Australia Airlines. In order to cover this situation, the Government arranged for the various States to enact legislation which effectively extends the rules under Part IV of the Act to intrastate operations. The Stale Premiers have been advised of the Commonwealth&#39;s present proposals and they have indicated their willingness lo amend their legislation correspondingly insofar as this is necessary, both in respect of the inclusion of all charter operations in the arrangements and the increases in the limits of liability. </para>
          <para>Sections 14 and 37 of the Act preserve the liability of a carrier to indemnify the employer of a passenger in respect of his commitments under workers&#39; compensation legislation. The Queensland Workers&#39; Compensation Act, however, differs from the legislation in other States, as it does not impose a liability on the employer to pay compensation, the injured worker recovering directly from the State Government Insurance Office. The Premier of Queensland has asked that the Act be amended to preserve the right of the Government Insurance Office to recover from the airline any compensation paid to an employee or his dependants in appropriate cases, so that the position in Queensland will be comparable with that applicable elsewhere. In considering this particular matter it has been concluded that the sections concerned should also be modified to cover the position where a person liable to pay workers&#39; compensation is not necessarily the employer of the person injured or killed and to ensure that they are effective in all cases where this type of compensation, however described, is payable. Clauses 3 and 7 of the Bill are designed to achieve all of these objectives. </para>
          <para>Some publicity has been given to a proposal by the Government to introduce a system of automatic interim payments to the dependent spouse and children of passengers killed in aircraft accidents. It is believed this will represent a significant improvement in the carriers&#39; liability arrangements, and the Government will submit suitable legislation to the Parliament to give effect to the proposal as soon as possible. It has not been practicable to do so at this time as certain legal aspects require further attention, but it was considered desirable to proceed with the basic amendments now included in the Bill rather than delay them until a later session of Parliament The Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act is a significant legislative measure in the functioning of the civil aviation industry in Australia. It affords protection to passengers and their dependants on the one hand and to the operators on the other, and is based on principles recognised throughout the world. The amendments now submitted for consideration by the Parliament are aimed at improving the Act in certain important respects - in particular in relation to the limits of liability and the extension to all charter flights. I commend the Bill. </para>

But I draw attention to the fact that at this late hour of the session the Parliament is being treated as a rubber stamp and new legislation is being introduced. An example is the way that this Bill, the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Liability) Bill and Australian National Airlines Bill have been brought in. I was approached at about 4 o&#39;clock this afternoon and asked whether I was prepared to proceed with a debate on these measures. I agreed on the pure and simple basis that if we did not proceed with the Bills this evening it could well be that we would have to wait until the August session to deal with them. In the event of there being an accident between now and then the unfortunate dependants of anyone killed or seriously injured in that accident would be entitled only to the existing damages of some $15,000. Although we hope that there will be no accidents, we want to ensure that if there is an accident a person&#39;s dependants will be entitled to the maximum rate of damages now proposed in this Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This measure provides for an amendment to the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act to increase the amount of compensation or damages from $15,000 to $30,000. In the case of loss of luggage or baggage the increase proposed is from $200 to $300, and in the case of hand luggage the proposed increase is from $20 to $30. The Opposition is not opposed to the principle of increasing these payments. Honourable members on this side of the chamber feel that because of inflation and Government policy they can agree with the Government that $15,000 today is not a reasonable amount to be paid by way of damages. Therefore we accept the proposition to increase the amount to $30,000. </para>
          <para>Another pleasing feature of the Bill is that in future the rights of passengers travelling on air taxi flights, charter flights and joy rides will be protected and passengers will be entitled to damages in the same way as if they were injured or killed in an accident on a licensed airline flight. This is an improvement to the legislation. It is long overdue and the Act should have been amended a considerable time ago to include this provision. I hope that the Government will introduce at an early date the proposal contained in the latter part of the speech delivered by the Attorney-General. That proposal provides for interim payments to a dependent spouse and dependent children of a passenger killed in an aircraft accident. This also is long overdue. In the event of an accident, because of the delay involved in inquiries which have to be conducted, a dependent spouse with children could be in the unfortunate position of knowing that some time in the distant future she would receive a lump sum payment of $30,000 but that in the meantime she would have difficulty in making ends meet. I know that it will be said that she would be able to apply for a widow&#39;s pension, but that is not the answer. The Government should amend the Act as early as possible to include the provisions mentioned in the second reading speech. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is concerned about the limit of liability. Members of the Opposition have always considered it to be a most unsatisfactory state of affairs that airline operators have been excluded from an obligation to pay unlimited damages in the event of a person being killed in an aircraft accident. The most that a dependent spouse or dependent children will be able to receive in damages will be $30,000 under this Bill. </para>

              <para>- I agree with that. Do not misunderstand me. I can assure the honourable member for Chisholm that members of the Australian Labor Party believe that there should be no limitation of liability. We have only to pick up a newspaper to read cases of people being badly maimed. It is not rare to see awards of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or even $100,000. Why should the insurance companies who insure people travelling in motor cars have to meet this commitment when the transport systems, whether they be rail or air, be excluded from it? There should not be any exclusion. If the court of the land says that a person has suffered a certain amount of disability why should he not be compensated? Why should the airlines and the railways be permitted to impose a maximum liability of $30,000? It is unfair, it is unjust and it should be removed. </para>

              <para>On 15th November 1965, the United States Government served notice of denunciation of the Warsaw Convention with effect from 15th May 1966. At the same time it indicated it was willing to negotiate a new international agreement preserving the benefits of the Convention but with an increase in the limit of liability to around $US 100,000 per passenger. This high figure was considered more appropriate having regard to the income and cost structure in the United States. Several countries, including Australia, made representations to the United States pointing out the serious affects that denunciation of the Convention would have for civil aviation. After protracted -negotiations, the Government of the United States approved an interim agreement made between the international airlines operating to that country, including Qantas, and a&#39; number of US domestic carriers, whereby the carriers agreed that the limit of liability for death or injury to passengers on  services including a point in the United States as a point of origin, destination or agreed stopping place was raised to $US75,000 including legal fees and costs, or $US58,O00 .exclusive of such fees and costs where the claim is brought in a country where costs are awarded in addition to damages.

              <para>No detailed consultation has yet taken place with the States on the limits of liability on domestic air services, but the State Ministers for Transport were advised of the Commonwealth&#39;s proposed review of its legislation, including the limits of liability, during the recent Australian Transport Advisory Council meeting. As mentioned above, the Government has taken part in negotiations regarding the international limits leading to the study of the matter by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. These negotiations have largely been conducted through ICAO and have taken place over a period of the last 3 years. The domestic operators were asked for their comments on proposals to amend the legislation as it affects them on 29th July 1968. No replies have yet been received. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The answer to that question indicates that it is proposed at a meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation to submit a proposition that the limit be lifted to $100,000. That amount is fair and reasonable. If a person can go into court and establish that the loss of the breadwinner has cost them something which could be compensated for by $100,000 then we are getting nowhere near it. The Opposition is still completely opposed to any limitation, but at least the Americans are approaching the matter in a fair and reasonable manner. They are talking about a reasonable amount of compensation. </para>
          <para>As a result of negotiations the United States Government threatened to denounce the conditions of the Warsaw Convention unless the airline operators lifted the amount of limited liability. The denouncing of the conditions of the Convention would really put civil aviation in a turmoil. As a result of that action it is now possible for a person travelling on an American aircraft or any aircraft operating through the United States of America to have a coverage of $US58,000, or approximately $A52,000. Honourable members might bear in mind the next time they travel overseas that any person travelling with a round the world ticket on an aircraft which takes him through the United States of America is covered by the American system of liability. It is important to bear this in mind. If a person leaves Australia and travels to New Zealand, Japan, across the United States of America, to London and down through Europe and back to Australia, he is entitled to the insurance coverage which the American Government has laid down for persons travelling on aircraft operating to, from or within the United States of America. This is true. This astounds honourable members on the other side of the House but it is factual, because I have checked these facts. I am not making an idle statement. I obtained the information from the legal officer of Qantas so that I would know our position. So I can at least back up my statement. If need be, I can name the gentleman, because I made the inquiry quite openly as if I were a passenger and that is the assurance I was given. So when honourable members vote against the amendment I intend to move very shortly they must realise what the position is. </para>
          <para>I repeat, any person who has a round the world ticket, or a ticket to the United States of America, provided it is with one of the 60-odd airlines that have entered into this agreement with the United States - and bearing in mind that unless airlines enter into this agreement they cannot operate through America - and the journey includes a city in the United States, named on the ticket, is entitled to the coverage to which I have just referred. The amount of the limited liability is $US58,000 or. i&#187; round terms $A52,0Q0. However, if a person Mies from Australia and names his point of destination as New York and his ticket states he is flying &#39;Australia-New York-London-New York-Sydney&#39; and when he arrives in London he then decides to extend his holiday and travels around Europe from London to Paris, Rome, Vienna and back to London he is not covered on that portion of his journey should anything happen. If the aircraft is in a crash and he is killed or in any way injured his dependents have no claim in respect of that section of the journey. But so long as his flying trip passes through the United States he has the coverage I am talking about. </para>
          <para>So when honourable members opposite vote against this amendment which I intend to move on behalf of the Opposition they should be aware of what they are doing, because at the present time our national airline, Qantas, is completely covered. It is paying these insurance premiums. That is no thanks to this Government, but thanks only to the United States Government for having imposed this condition. It is wide ranging, but the facts are there, and I challenge the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes),</inline> who is at the table, to deny that what I have said is true. I hope that the information he is now getting is sufficient to convince him that what I have said is true. That is the position as far as we are concerned. Another thing which concerns me on this question of the limitation of liability is that an airline can be most negligent in the maintenance of its aircraft. I will just refer to a couple of serious accidents that have occurred in this country. Let us take the crash at Port Hedland on 31st December 1968. A subsequent inquiry clearly established that it was caused by negligence on someone&#39;s part because a bush in an important part of the structure of that aircraft was hammered into position and not put in by the normal method that would be adopted by any experienced engineer. If that is not negligence then I do not know what is. The inquiry into the Winton air disaster some years ago clearly established that it was due to negligence because a part of the engine of that aircraft had been put in the wrong way. It was put in upside down. </para>
          <para>I could cite a number of accidents that have occurred in Australia where it has been evident from the inquiries conducted that there was negligence as a result of which aircraft have crashed and people have lost their lives. Why should the airline operators in these cases be in the privileged position of not being required to pay maximum damages? It is quite easy to overcome this. It has been said that if any set amount is removed from the Act the dependants of a deceased passanger will have to go to a court and establish their entitlement but in this way they can get $30,000 without any trouble at all. As dependants of a deceased passenger and in view of what his income had been they are entitled to $30,000 compensation. Why should the airline operator who has committed serious breaches of the regulations be excluded? If a passenger is killed in a motor car accident it is the accepted thing in the courts today that the driver must have been negligent otherwise the accident would not have occurred. The courts determine the amount of damages to be awarded to the deceased passenger&#39;s dependant spouse or children. The same thing should apply to the airline industry. Airline operators are in ari unfair and privileged position and this privilege should be taken away from them immediately. </para>
          <para>I admit that as far as international operations are concerned we should wait until the next meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation takes place, which I understand. is to be in 1971, when this proposition to remove the limitation of liability can be dealt with on an international level. However, there is nothing to prevent this Government from accepting the Opposition&#39;s proposal in regard to Australia&#39;s internal airlines. The Government may, of course, say that it has already negotiated an agreement with the State Premiers. In that case there is nothing to prevent the Government from negotiating fresh agreements with the Premiers which can then be brought into this House. I do not think that any State Premier would object to something that is fair and reasonable such as removal of the limitation of liability. We on this side of the House realise what is taking place and on behalf of the Opposition 1 move: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That all words after &#39;That&#39; be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: </para>
            <para>While not opposing the passage of the Bill, the House is of opinion that the limits of liability  under International Convention are unjust and therefore requests that the Government take action to have the injustice rectified by pressing for a revision of the International Conventions to increase the limits applied in the absence of negligence and to remove the limits where negligence is proved and, in the meantime, to take action similar to that taken by the United States Government in 1965 and 1966, that is, to obtain agreement with the international airlines operating to this country and our international airline, whereby the limit of liability for death or injury to passengers on services including a point in this country as a point of origin, destination or agreed stopping place will be raised to an amount of $A52,000.00 exclusive of legal fees and costs. </para>

              <para>- 1 do not suggest for one moment that what the honourable member for Newcastle has said in his speech in the second reading debate ought not to engage the attention of the Government. Please do not let it be thought that I am endeavouring in any way to dismiss lightly what the honourable member has said. The Government must tread carefully in this field because an international convention is involved. We do not want to take any unilateral action which might be construed as a denunciation of an international convention by which we are bound. An international conference on this and other questions involving international civil aviation is to be held in early 1971. At that conference amendments to the Warsaw Convention will be taken into considera tion. Australia will participate in the conference. Indeed, it has had a representative on the committee of the International Civil Aviation Organisation which has been instrumental in examining proposals which will be put to the conference. In the meantime the Government will consider its position on the limit of liability in regard to international flights. That may not be as much comfort or satisfaction as the honourable member for Newcastle may wish but it may go some of the way towards meeting his point. I am afraid, however, that this is as far as the Government can go. We reject the proposed amendment. </para>

            <para>-  The honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> was good enough to outline the nature of the amendments he proposed to move, and now has moved, when he made his second reading speech. He will be aware of the Government&#39;s attitude because it was declared by my colleague, the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> in the Senate when the Bill which originated in that chamber was debated there. Very briefly, speaking as the Government, we are unable to accept the amendment. My honourable friend will agree that I had given the Committee something of a clue to the reasons when I indicated why we proposed to reject the Opposition&#39;s amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In short, the amendments propose a fundamental change in the legislation. They propose a radical departure from worldwide practice in aviation which has tended to move away from a situation where the plaintiff has to prove negligence on the part of the carrier and to replace, and not supplement, this common law principle or arrangement with a situation of automatic liability. What the amendments really propose is that a passenger should have the best of both worlds. At present, having regard to international practice, the Government feels unable to go along with the Opposition&#39;s detailed proposal. I doubt whether I need say any more at this stage, because those members of the Committee who are familiar with the provisions of the Bill and of the detailed amendments which have been moved by the Opposition would have gathered fully the reasons from a perusal of the Senate Hansard. </para>

            <para>-  The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> says that the Opposition is trying to give the passenger the best of 2 worlds and that the amendments provide for a movement away from the accepted and customary procedures in respect of civil aviation. We plead guilty to that because we consider that civil aviation has been living and moving in a very privileged sphere for too long and that it is time it was taken out of this field of privilege and of limited liability. My interpretation of the Workers Compensation Act is that it permits a dependent spouse or dependent children to accept the amounts laid down in the Act of so much for death and so much for loss of limb or, if they feel that they have a common law action that they can take where the employer has been negligent, they can go to the court to try to get a greater amount by way of damages. If they miss out there they can take the amount prescribed by the legislation. This is the provision that the Opposition is trying to write into this legislation. If a dependent spouse or dependent children feel that an airline operator has been negligent - and I could go into extensive detail if circumstances permitted in respect of cases where I think there has been negligence in airline accidents - they should be entitled to the best of both worlds. We admit that we are trying to take airline operators out of the privileged class and to give their passengers the opportunity of taking, to use a popular term, the money or the box. We feel they are entitled to do so. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be  now  read a second time. With the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard as my second reading speech the second reading speech of my colleague the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman).</inline> It reads: The purpose of this Bill is to repeal section 66 of the Australian National Airlines Act. This section of the Act provides that in any action brought against the Australian National Airlines Commission to recover damages for death or injury, other than in cases subject to the Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act or the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than $15,000, this limit being related to that specified in the latter Act. In an action not covered by the 2 Acts mentioned, therefore, such as one arising from an accident caused by the Trans-Australia airlines vehicle, the plaintiff firstly has to prove negligence on the part of the Commission and also has a ceiling on the amount of damages he can recover. </para>
          <para>This is quite contrary to the normal common law situation, where negligence has to be proved but there is no limit on the damages recoverable. It also differs from the carriers liability legislation principle, whereby the damages are subject to a limitation but the plaintiff does not have to prove negligence. In effect, section 66 results in an injured party having two constraints on his ability to recover reasonable damages. A similar provision existed formerly in the Commonwealth Railways Act, and the Parliament repealed the relevant section in 1968. </para>
          <para>As the limit of liability in section 66 of the Australian National Airlines Act is related to that specified in the Civil Aviation (Carriers&#39; Liability) Act, and the latter is to be amended, the Government has considered what action should be taken concerning this section. It has concluded that the Australian National Airlines Commission should not be in a specially favoured position in this respect, and proposes that section 66 be repealed, as was done in the case of the comparable section in the Commonwealth Railways Act. I commend the Bill. </para>

            <para>-  Very briefly, the Opposition supports this Bill and the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Liability) Bill, which will follow this Bill. As I said in a debate earlier this evening, civil aviation has been in a privileged class. I am pleased that in one particular field the Government has removed civil aviation from that privileged class. The Bill repeals section 66 of the Australian National Airlines Act 1945-66. This Bill indicates to honourable members that the privilege in relation to airlines has been removed. Formerly if a passenger were travelling in an airline bus from the city terminal to the airport, or vice versa, and were involved in an accident, limited liability would apply. If a passenger were travelling in a private bus and were involved in an accident and injured, be could take the case to court and liability would not be limited. The passenger on the airline bus would be entitled to only limited damages. If the passenger were killed, his dependants could take the matter to court and would get only limited damages. This provision should never have been written into the Act. I am pleased to see that the Government is removing it from the Act. </para>

            <para>- by leave - On the night of Saturday, 18th April 1970 a fire occurred at the No. 4 shipbuilding berth of the Whyalla Shipyard and Engineering Works, a division of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. The fire burned fiercely and as a result the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39;, a 62,000 deadweight ton tanker being built for R. W. Miller &#38; Co. Pty Ltd, was very severely damaged. As ships built under the subsidy scheme remain the property of the Commonwealth until completion and handover to the owner, I made an on the spot inspection of the damage on Monday, 20th April at which time the fire was still smouldering although the main fire was out. It was plain at that time that the partially built tanker was severely damaged. The blocks supporting the keel had been burnt out for some distance and the structure had fallen to the ground, severely buckling the steelwork. Assessments since made of the damage suggest that more than 80% of the steelwork will have to be replaced. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At the time of my inspection I arranged with BHP that an inquiry would be carried out by a senior departmental officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> S. Clarke, First Assistant Secretary (Shipbuilding.) The company readily agreed to the suggestion. The company itself proposed to conduct its own separate investigation. It became apparent, however, as the investigations proceeded that there would be considerable duplication and overlapping as witnesses were questioned, tests were made and so on. Accordingly it was decided that the report as such would be prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clarke</inline> in collaboration with BHP and with full and complete access to all the information obtained by BHP concerning the fire. The investigation has concluded that the most likely cause of the fire was that hot metal, slag or sparks from welding, cutting or gouging lodged in cracks in, or gaps between, softwood blocks below the ship. Alternatively a small fire, started by such operations and thought to have been put out by the operators concerned, may not have been completely extinguished. After some hours of smouldering a fire flared up, perhaps due to a change of wind. In addition, the release due to heat of highly inflammable propane gas and oxygen both used in cutting steel, contributed to the rapid establishment and fierce spread of the fire. </para>
          <para>Whilst the shipyard is patrolled at regular intervals by the company&#39;s watchmen the fire was not detected until it was well established. The report states that both portable and permanent fire fighting equipment is provided near the shipbuilding berths. It also concludes that the training and equipment at the Whyalla Shipyard, for the detection and fighting of small fires which frequently occur during working hours near welding and cutting operations, appeared to be adequate. The report does point, out, however, that delay in opening a partially closed valve in the fire main serving the berth contributed to the difficulty in containing the fire in the early stages and that the narrow clearance between the ship&#39;s side and the wall of the berth appears to have added to the difficulty of access to hydrants and to the fire. Damage to the tanker is valued at about $3m. The insurable interest in the tanker by the shipowner, the Commonwealth and the builder is covered by comprehensive insurance with London underwriters. </para>
          <para>I would point out that no major building berth fire had been experienced in Australia prior to that of the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39;. Even by world standards the fire was unusual in its intensity, the speed with which it spread and the damage which it caused. In these circumstances the Shipbuilding Board had been satisfied with the facilities available at Whyalla and other shipyards. I should point out that the contractual arrangements between the companies and the Commonwealth place the responsibility for the care and efficient protection of the vessel and any opponent upon the builder himself. The investigation following this fire has shown, however, that some improvements are necessary. I have therefore asked the Shipbuilding Board to proceed immediately with action to ensure that fire precaution and fire fighting procedures are adequate not only at Whyalla but at all shipyards building vessels under the Commonwealth shipbuilding subsidy scheme. In particular they are to look at any special precautions that may be necessary in the use and location of bottled highly inflammable gases. </para>
          <para>The discovery during the fire that an isolating valve in a fire main was only par tially opened indicates the need for regular inspection of fire prevention equipment to ensure that it is always ready for immediate use. This is a further matter which I have asked the Shipbuilding Board to investigate. Since the fire BHP has already taken a number of steps to improve fire prevention facilities at the Whyalla shipyard. In addition the Australian Shipbuilding Board has asked all, yards recognised for the purposes of Commonwealth shipbuilding subsidy to forward immediately details of fire precaution and fire prevention measures in their shipyards. I would also mention that very good progress is being made in the rebuilding of the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39;. The Whyalla shipyard is making a determined effort to have the vessel finished as close as possible to the original contract date. 1 present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- I have not yet received them. But I accept the Ministers assurance that some time today or some time in the near future I will receive answers to questions Nos 969, 970 and 971. But I cannot accept the Minister&#39;s explanation in respect of question No. 972. It was a very simple one to answer. A phone call to the fire commissioner in Adelaide would have provided the answer to lt. Yet it lay on the notice paper from 8th May until today. So I cannot accept the Minister&#39;s explanation in respect of that one. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One thing that strikes me in regard to the report is the attempt to throw the blame on to a boilermaker and an apprentice. At page 7 of the report details are given of the fires that allegedly took place. I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that when gouging is being carried out on this type of work - I am talking on a subject about which I know a fair bit - there is a lot of spark. A nozzle is fitted to burning gear and it throws a lot of spark, lumps of red hot slag drop on to the floor of the slipway or wherever the burning is being done, and it splashes. </para>
          <para>Just to allow this type of work to be carried out and then to have an inspector come along at some later stage and not carry out a real and close inspection, in my opinion, represents criminal negligence on the part of the builder. I do not want to give the impression that I am having a crack at BHP because I am not. I consider that this incident shows a serious case of negligence. The more one reads the report, the more one must come to this conclusion. </para>
          <para>Here we have a case where a boilermaker and an apprentice were carrying out work of a dangerous nature - that is probably the only way the work can be described - as far as the safety of the ship was concerned. It was work as I indicated a moment ago - I do not wish to repeat myself - where a lot of hot metal was flying around. A 25 knot wind was blowing at this time. So, this hot metal could have been blown around. Sparks and hot metal could have lodged in almost any place and caused the fire at some later stage. The fire inspector should have been placed in a position to observe these things. The watchman, whose duty it was to go around and look for fires, should have been warned that gouging had been carried out. Gouging is not something which occurs occasionally. It is a regular procedure in building ships of this type. This man should have been charged with the responsibility by his employer of carrying out a very close and thorough investigation to make sure that no hot metal was left around in areas where a fire could be caused. </para>
          <para>The Minister in his statement said that the hot metal had landed somewhere and that it just lay there. Then, when the wind changed direction, apparently the fire just blew up. To use the Minister&#39;s own words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>After some hours of smouldering a fire flared up perhaps due to a change of wind. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask honourable members to look at appendix 2 to the report. It shows that at 3 p.m. the wind was from die north at 25 knots. At 9 p.m., half an hour before the fire was detected, the wind was from the west at 9 knots. But the slipway is oriented to the north west. So, the position is this: Whether the wind blows from the north or from the west it will be blowing almost down the slipway. If a fire were to break out as a result of these men having worked there earlier in the day surely a 25 knot wind which blew sometime during the afternoon and which changed direction sometime between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. could have flared up a flame. I draw attention to (hat fact. </para>
          <para>I turn to another part of the report in which it is stated that the night watchmen proceeded around at 4.35 p.m. They left the main gate at 4.35 p.m. They completed the patrol in 65 minutes and returned to their office. This is the important part: It is disclosed at page 9 of the report that the first patrol was from 4.44 p.m. to 6.26 p.m. The second patrol was from 7.14 p.m. to 9.22 p.m. The report goes on to say: </para>

            <para class="block">This placed him along the road in front of the Amanda Miller&#39; on 5 or 6 occasions up to 9.25 p.m. and there was nothing unusual that he observed from the roadway. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I draw the attention of honourable members to one fact. It is that at 9.35 p.m. there was a huge flame which was visible from another part of the steelworks industry. At 9.25, when that inspection was completed, the report states - and I repeat it: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. there was nothing unusual that he observed from the roadway. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The next paragraph of the report stales: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>He did not make an inspection beneath the Amanda Miller&#39; or along the slipway crane track during the shift. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Why not? What is wrong with making such an inspection? He should have been under the ship. He should have gone down under it every time that he carried out an inspection. Once again I want to qualify my remarks by saying that I am not blaming the inspectors. Their duties are laid down by the company. Yet a ship costing millions of dollars was being built and dangerous work was being carried out around the ship. I emphasise that point But the night watchman did hot make any inspection beneath the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; or along the slipway crane track during the shift. What the heck is the use of carrying out an inspection if you do not carry out a close inspection and get down underneath the ship? In other shipyards I have seen men burning and welding and a man has been standing by with a portable fire extinguisher. If something went wrong and a fire broke out he could put the flames out. </para>
          <para>I will admit that fire fighting equipment was available at the Whyalla shipyard. That is mentioned in the report, and I accept it as a fact. But the point is that trouble occurs after men cease work. If a fire begins while men are on the job they can see it and put it out very quickly. Inspections were carried out from 4.44 p.m. to 6.26 p.m. and from 7.14 p.m. to 9.22 p.m. In my opinion, the inspections were too casual. They should have been much more detailed and thorough. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Up to 9.35 p.m. no sign of - the fire beneath or around the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; was reported by any shipyard or steelworks personnel. </para>
            <para>The lighting around the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; was described as brilliant. </para>
            <para>At approximately ,9.35 p.m. a flare was seen by the Weighbridge Attendant at the vehicle weighbridge in the steelworks area. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The weighbridge attendant saw the flare. He immediately rang the security officer who was sitting in an office. The security officer could see the fire from where he was sitting. The reason given for the security officer not having seen- the fire previously was that there was a bright desk lamp in front of him. All right, I accept that, but probably other people will not accept it. To me it is a very paltry explanation for his not seeing the fire. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The events to 9.35 p.m. suggest that the fire which was started in the blocks of the starboard launching way by the gouging operation near the end of the day shift was not effectively quenched and later produced sufficient heat to cause smouldering in the timber blocks and eventually fire. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am not questioning that that did cause the fire. But what I am saying is- that the blame for this fire should and must not be sheeted home to the men who were working in the shipyard. The blame lays in the inadequate inspection procedures which the company had laid down. I keep coming back to the point that the night watchman did not make an inspection beneath the Amanda Miller* or alo&#39;ng the slipway crane track during the shift. Dangerous work was being carried out but sufficient supervision was not given to guard against a fire such as that which happened at the shipyard. </para>
          <para>Another interesting fact is that the fire was first noted at 9.35 p.m. in -the blast furnace area of the steelworks. The security officer was immediately advised of it by telephone. So both the weighbridge attendant and the security officer were aware of the fire at 9.35 p.m. To me, the sensible and logical thing for them to do was ring the shipyard watchman and advise him that there was a fire. There is no doubt that at this stage it was a serious fire. But did these men do that sensible and logical thing? According to the report they did not. They then collected the head security officer and went around by vehicle to the shipyard gate. On . page 14 of the report it is stated:  the Weighbridge Attendant, the Blast Furnace Security Officer . . . picked up the Security Officer, drove to a Security Store to pick up some fire fighting equipment, then drove to the Shipyard Main Gate where they were let into the Shipyard by the Main Gate Watchman at aproximately 9.50 p.m. The Main Gate Watchman was unaware of the fire at the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; at this time. </para>
          <para class="block">That means that for 15 minutes someone could at least have been trying to do something. The security staff&#39; in the shipyard could have been trying to do something in that 15 minutes to put the fire out, but they were not, because they had not been advised. This is another breach of the part of the company. This report, at page 15, reads like a Gilbert and Sullivan comedy. It says: </para>

            <para>Some minutes were lost before a hose was connected to a hydrant at the bow of the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39;. Three lengths of 100 ft hose were finally run out and an initial effort was made to fight the fire from the starboard side. This was at 9.57 p.m. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is after the fire had been raging for some 28 minutes. I give credit to the Whyalla Town Brigade that the bells were rung at the fire station at 10.05 p.m. and the town firemen were on the scene at 10.18, 13 minutes later. The question I ask is: Why, when the fire was first noted - and from this report it was obviously at that stage a bad fire - was not the town brigade alerted - at 9.35 p.m., instead of 10.05 p.m., 30 minutes later? These are the things that really concern me. </para>
          <para>Then more farce. The report continues: </para>

          <para class="block">That is all right; I can understand their being a little delayed - immediately checked the fresh water main pressure which was 95 to 100 lb/sq. in. On arrival at the slipway he saw that the fire was threatening the main transformer and returned to the substation with the Electrical Engineer and cut power from the slipway area. This was at 10.34 p.m. Various attempts were made to supply water to the suctions of the pumps, but these were unsuccessful. </para>
          <para class="block">The time  -  10.34 p.m., 59 minutes after the fire was reported. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>However, at approximately 10.50 p.m. an examination of the isolating valve for No. 4 Slipway was made and this was found to be partially closed. On fully opening this valve full pressure was obtained in the hydrant main. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the position. At 9.35 the fire is reported, and it is not until 10.50 p.m. that somebody finds this serious error which caused water to be withheld. It must be obvious to honourable members that it was in this first critical hour that the fire really got out of control and that the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; was doomed. The photographs in this report show oxy-acetylene and propane bottles, containing substances which are highly inflammable, scattered all over the ship. This shipyard works to a different procedure to other shipyards. The shipyard where I worked for so long works on the basis of having no  more  than half a dozen oxy bottles on board a ship. The rest of the equipment is connected to lines that have been put right through the shipyard so that if a fire such as this occurs they will not be in the position where they have highly inflammable oxy-acetylene or propane all over the ship which, if the ship catches fire, becomes a ready made fuel to keep the fire going. If any honourable member examines the photographs he will see large heaps of welding leads all over the ship. I accept this state of affairs. This is unavoidable. It is quite probable that there were 70, 80 or even more welders working on the ship at the time. Welding leads would be excellent  fuel  in a fire. I do not think that one could get anything better, than rubber to  burn  other than oil or, as in this case, oxygen and propane bottles. I am certain that the shipyard must review its method of operations. It should have a much safer system; I do not know whether it has since been changed. As did the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> I went over there to have a look at the shipyard. I waited until about a week or 10 days after the fire before doing so. I saw a lot of things which he would have seen. I accept the situation as far as welding leads are concerned, but I cannot accept that the shipyard was operating under safe working conditions when propane and oxygen bottles were lying around the ship. Oregon blocks were also used. Some shipyards use hardwood blocks, but this yard saw fit to use  Oregon  blocks, which are highly inflammable. There was tallow all over them because they had been used for a number of years. Tallow is used to grease the way so that a ship will slip down into the water. Tallow is also highly inflammable. Once the fire got under way it would be hopeless to try to stop it. </para>
          <para>I feel that the people who were responsible for fighting the fire in the shipyard were remiss. I know that it is all right to talk after the event, that one can always be wise the next day, but people who are trained in handling fires should have realised these things. The valve was partially closed and they were getting only a trickle of water through. That should never have occurred because during their training they should go through the process of checking to see that everything is right. They should check to see that the hoses have not been cut in half or have holes in them. They should also check to see that the valves are operating efficiently. As far as I am concerned, this is all part of the fire drill. </para>
          <para>But why was the Whyalla town fire brigade not called much earlier? It was called over half an hour after the fire had been first reported. When it was obvious that the fire was very bad why was not the Port Augusta fire brigade contacted and asked to come to the fire? There are 2 brigades at Port Pirie - a full time brigade and a back-up brigade. Why was the backup crew of the Port Pirie brigade not taken to Port Augusta to replace the Port Augusta fire crew so that it could assist in fighting this fire? Why was the fourth executive officer from Adelaide not alerted much earlier? If I remember rightly, he did not arrive at the fire until 7.15 a.m. although the fire had been reported at 9.35 p.m. the previous day. Why was he not at the scene of the fire much earlier? Why did it take him 9 hours and 40 minutes to get to the fire? </para>
          <para>The Port Pirie fire brigade did not arrive at Whyalla until 4.15 a.m. on the Sunday, which was 6 hours and 40 minutes after the fire had been reported. This fact appears at page 18 of the report, which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It does appear that any possibility of effectively dealing with the fire under the conditions pertaining had faded by 1 1 p.m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A fire engine should have been able to get from Port Augusta in about an hour. A back-up machine could have come from Port Pirie to Port Augusta. A fire engine from Port Augusta should have been at the scene of the fire no later than 11 p.m. There are so many things wrong with this that I regret to say that I cannot accept the contents of this report. I ask the Minister: Will we get a copy of the report from the South Australian Fire Brigades Board? Is it to be tabled? Will we be told what actually happened? What is the interpretation of the Fire Brigades Board of what happened? I cannot understand why the Government tables a report on this matter in the Parliament without including in it a report from the Fire Brigades Board. They are the experts. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth may be insured but all that that means is that the Government will have to pay higher premiums the next time it wants to take out a policy. Insurance companies will be a little warier in the future when insuring ships under construction. The answer by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> to question No. 944 asked by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is an indication that probably fire fighting facilities in shipyards are not satisfactory, particularly when one reads that the Minister advised the Leader of the Opposition that there should be fulltime fire fighters in every shipyard and that they should work on a 24 hour basis. I do not want to incorporate the question in Hansard but for the information of honourable members it appears at page 2887. Now that the Commonwealth Fire Board has made this recommendation about Cockatoo Island, I think that wherever the Commonwealth has ships being built on which it is paying subsidy, the Board should be asked to send an inspector to inspect the fire fighting equipment, make recommendations and give advice. I am confident that the shipyard management would be only too happy to have inspectors visit their establishments and would accept their advice. If Cockatoo Island warrants a fulltime fire officer then I think that every shipyard in Australia, particularly the larger ones such as Evans Deakin, the State Dockyard and Whyalla, should be able to afford them. </para>

          <para>I reiterate what I said earlier. I do not think that the boilermaker and the apprentice should have the blame sheeted home to them. Let us forget for a moment that boilermakers and I are members of the one union, but at least I know a little bit about shipbuilding. The blame has to be sheeted home to the employer for having failed to lay down a system of inspection which would require the night watchman to go over the ship not once but continually after the men had finished work. I have fished at night in the State Dockyard after men have finished work. It is one of the best fishing spots in Newcastle for jewfish - or it used to be. Other men also have fished there at night. I have seen the watchman making his rounds night after night, going over ships to make sure that there were no fires. I think a similar procedure should be followed at Whyalla. I hope that the workmen on the job, the boilermaker and the apprentice, will not be blamed. I do not blame the watchman for having failed to carry out his duties. All I say is that the duties of the watchman were not extensive enough to ensure that an accident like this did not occur. 1 hope that the lessons that have been learned from this fire will ensure that there will be no similar fires in the future because they are disastrous to the industry. I give credit to BHP because none of the men lost time as a result of the fire. Those who could not be employed usefully in the shipyard were transferred to another part of the company&#39;s establishment - the steelmaking section - and in this way continuity of employment was ensured. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The grants and loans which the Commonwealth has made to the States for each railway, road, port, water and power project in the 25 years ended 30 June 1969, together with the amount involved in each case, the period of repayment of and rate of interest on loans, the repayments made in 1968-69, and total repayments required on advances made by 30 June 1969 are shown in the attached table. </para>
            <para>In addition tothe projects shown in the table, the Commonwealth has also passed legislation to provide grants for the Copeton Dam in New South Wales ($20 million), the Tailem Bend to Keith Pipeline in South Australia ($6 million), the Cressy-Longford Irrigation Works in Tasmania ($0.75 million) and proposes to provide a grant to Queensland of $12.8 million for the Bundaberg Irrigation Works. The Commonwealth is also proposing to make a loan of $80 million to Queensland for the Gladstone Power Station. </para>
            <para>Inthe case of loans, it is not possible to provide complete details of total repayments which the Commonwealth will receive in respect of projects for which Commonwealth advances are still being made, as these will depend upon the amounts of the loans still to be made, the date on which each advance is made and the rate of interest which will apply to each advance.  Not  is it possible, with the exception of the Weipa harbour works, the Mount Isa railway reconstruction project and the development component of the Western Australia railway project, to give details of the annual repayments to be made by the States. Annual repayments in respect of all other projects vary from year to year as, in cases where loans have not yet been fully taken up, the advances still to be made will cause repayment obligations to increase progressively until the loans are complete. In the case of completed loans, the decreasing interest component on the reducing outstanding balances results in progressively smaller annual repayments. Repayments of principal and payments of interest in respect of the three projects mentioned above are payable on a credit foncier basis and, consequently, there are equal annual amounts repayable in respect of each project. The details of these are as follows: </para>

        <para>As the honourable member will be aware, the question of whether an individual with particular overseas qualifications be permitted to practice in an Australian State or Territory, is decided by the authorities responsible - in the case of medical practitioners the medical registration boards. </para>
        <para>The honourable member may be interested to know that at present the Australian Capital Territory Medical Practitioners Registration Ordinance 1930-1969 is being reviewed with the intention of providing for the establishment of an expert advisory committee whose functions would be to recommend a new schedule of acceptable qualifications for the Territory and to keep the schedule under review in relation to deletions and additions. It is also intended to provide for. the appointment of a further Committee which would report to the Australian Capital Territory Medical Registration Board on the acceptability of overseas applicants with qualifications not included in the proposed new schedule. </para>

            <para>In most States, classification of wards in public hospitals into public, intermediate and private is dependent to some degree upon the varying demand for one type of accommodation or another. Only in New South Wales have the State Authorities been able to supply complete details of the number of beds in public hospitals available in each category since 1948. In Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania intermediate and private ward accommodation in public hospitals is considered together, while in South Australia and Western Australia no individual classification is made. </para>

Laurence Aarons, the National Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, recently said that current Communist Party of Australia membership is about 4,500. However, Rupert Lockwood, an ex-Communist Party of Australia member, was reported in The Australian&#39; of 24th January 1970 to have said that there would be no more than 3,000 card carrying members of the Communist Party of Australia. I have no information as to the number of members of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist/Leninist) butI believe the number of members to be small. </para>

Some of the securities issued in special loans have since matured and have been either redeemed or converted; others have been exchanged by the Government for securities held by institutional investors.

            <para>The information sought by the honourable member is not available. It is believed, however, that the Laboratories share of the market is approximately 2% at the present time. &#39; </para>
            <para>I would emphasise that there is no percentage limitation imposed on the output of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in relation to that of other pharmaceutical companies. The share of the market referred to above is that attained by the Laboratories in competition with other firms. </para>

      <para class="block">Land Reform </para>
      <para>A decree promulgated in 1956 provided for expropriation by the Government of all holdings of rice land in excess of 100 hectares (1 hectare equals 2.47 acres), together with legislation providing that an owner of 100 hectares must farm at least 30 hectares on his own behalf. In 1958 French citizens were permitted to surrender their land holdings to the Government at current market values. By these two measures the Government acquired title to approximately 650,000 hectares of rice land, a little over 30% of the total. By the end of 1969 about 600,000 hectares of this land had been redistributed to the peasant population and since early 1969 people receiving redistributed landhave now been required to pay for it. The redistribution programme was accompanied by an agricultural credit programme to help the new owners to finance their production costs. </para>
      <para>On 26th March 1970 a new land reform bill was promulgated which incorporated the &#39;Land to the Tiller&#39; programme. This aims at abolishing all tenancy of farm lands and at promoting security of tenure to the tiller. Any tenant who has been farming land for one season may now claim title to that land and village administrative committees have been empowered to grant such titles for areas of up to 3 hectares in the southern regions and the central highlands of 1 hectare in Central Vietnam. The titles are granted free of charge and the new owners are exempted from land tax for a period of 12 months. </para>
      <para>Former land owners may retain up to 15 hectares of rice land provided that they have been farming this land themselves. Otherwise they may claim compensation which would be paid 20% in cash and the balance in interest bearing bonds convertible over 8 years. </para>

In the past some prices paid by purchasers of rural leases have exceeded the value of improvements and in these cases, when it became necessary to do so, estate duty was assessed on such amounts. Nowadays however, the value for estate duty purposes is found generally to be more or less equivalent to the value of the .improvements. </para>

          <para>Official statistics of earnings and rates of pay are collected and published by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. </para>
          <para>Direct estimates of the amount of ordinary time earnings in excess of award, etc., rates were obtained by the Bureau in the course of special surveys of the structure of earnings as at September 1960 and October 1965. These particulars are shown in the published results. Those for the second survey were shown in terms of average amounts per employee for adult males working full time classified by industry. State, Governmental or other, managerial, etc., and other. </para>
          <para>I am advised by the Commonwealth Statistician that it is intended to conduct the third of these special surveys in the first half of 1971. The Statistician also advises that he is exploring the possibility of (i) conducting these surveys on an alternative basis which would enable them to be more frequent and (ii) obtaining from these surveys estimates of the proportions of employees who receive ordinary time payments in excess of award, etc., rates. </para>

              <para>Secondary school boarding fees for each pupil at a high school are fixed according to the sub-district from which the pupil comes. The rates of secondary school boarding fees payable in respect of pupils from each sub-district of the Territory are set out in the following table. The fees apply to pupils boarding at Administration High Schools and have also been applied by mission high schools. The maximum fee for each district within the overall ceiling of $30 was set by the Ministerial Member for Education acting on the advice of the local District Education Committee. The rates payable in each area within a district were set in turn by the District Education Committee subject to the Ministerial Member&#39;s approval. As shown in the table, the rates therefore vary within sub-districts. Provision is made for the fee for individual students to be reduced or waived by the District Education Committee in cases of hardship. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>In the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 27th February 1969 the Public Service Board published new determinations relating to a variety of positions, including positions of Cost Investigator, Official Receiver, Investigation Officers in the Department of Primary Industry, Realisation Officers Grade 2, and certain positions in the Commonwealth Taxation Office engaged in assessing, investigation and appeals work. </para>

              <para>In 1965 and 1966, following joint reviews by the Board and relevant Departments, the Board determined that the educational qualifications required for the performance of the duties of these positions would be set at the standard represented by the associate membership examination of the Australian Society of Accountants. </para>

          <para>With effect from the beginning of 1967 the Australian Society of Accountants raised the standard of educational requirements for associate membership. The new standards adopted by the Society required completion of a university degree or a diploma in Accountancy from an Institute of Technology, followed by a qualifying examination conducted by the Society. </para>
          <para>Following these changes the Board, in conjunction with relevant Departments, re-examined the educational needs for the positions referred to and the implications of the new standards adopted by the Society. It was decided that the needs of these positions were met by the previous standards. This decision required a change in the determinations made by the Board in 1965 and 1966 because those determinations were related to the membership standards of the Society. </para>

            <para>Pacific islanders seeking to travel to Australia for any purpose other than transit to another country are required to obtain visas or other forms of prior permission to do so, on the same basis as residents of other countries, as described in the concurrent answer to Question No. 1121. </para>
            <para>Government policy as announced in this House on 9th March 1966 permits consideration of applications for entry to Australia for residence by persons of non European descent, on the basis of their suitability as settlers, their ability to integrate readily and their possession of qualifications which are in fact positively useful to Australia. Since the 1950s the spouses, fiances, fiancees and close dependent relatives of residents of Australia have also been eligible to enter for residence. </para>
            <para>In order to facilitate travel and tourism persons seeking to travel to Australia as visitors are promptly granted permission to do so unless there is reason to doubt that a genuine visit is intended. </para>
            <para>Visa officers are expected to exercise care and discretion in such assessmentsto avoid numerous deportations of spurious visitors. However in the great majority of applications permission is granted quickly. </para>
            <para>It is understood that New Zealand&#39;s laws and procedures relating to Pacific islanders seeking to enter for residence or visits are essentially similar except that the peoples of the Cook Islands, Nine and Tokelau Islands are New Zealand citizens and are entitled to enter New Zealand. They have to satisfy certain conditions before being permitted to leave their islands. </para>

            <para>Income tax deductions under the heading of education expenses are allowable to a parent if the child is receiving full-time education at a school. This requirement is satisfied where the child is of an age to receive education of the kind furnished by a standard kindergarten and the establishment to which the fees are paid provides such educational facilities. Payments made to a child minding centre solely for the purpose of providing for the care or supervision of a child do not qualify as education expenses and are outgoings of a private or domestic nature. The question of amending the law to allow deductions for fees paid by working mothers to child minding centres will be considered during the preparation of the 1970-71 Budget. </para>

Current figures for these series are published in regular monthly or quarterly statistical bulletins or special publications as soon as they become available. </para>
          <para>The needs of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and those who appear before it in National Wages Cases arc met so far as the relevant series are concerned by the inclusion in a common exhibit book (prepared by the Department of Labour and National Service) of publications containing the latest available figures. This book, which also contains other data relevant to the hearing, is kept up to date during the proceedings. Delay in publication of the Labour Report does not therefore prevent convenient access during National Wage Cases to the latest available figures. </para>

              <para>Like all Commonwealth University scholarships, Mature Age awards provide for the payment of all compulsory tuition fees and other statutory fees and. in appropriate cases, a travelling allowance. In addition a living allowance is also payable to full-time students. This is subject to a means test bused on the scholar&#39;s own income and, if he is married, the income of bis wife. The maximum allowance payable is $19.23 per week (equivalent to $1,000 per annum). For single scholars the allowance abates at the rate of 20 cents for every 30 cents by which the scholar&#39;s income exceeds $7 per week. Different abatement rates apply in the case of married scholars. Provided a scholar is receiving a living allowance, an allowance of up to $7 per week is payable for a dependent wife and an allowance of $2.50 per week for each dependent child under 16 years of age. </para>

Any additional expenditure incurred personally by a Mature Age scholarship holder in attending the university, whether on a full time or part lime basis, is not deductible. </para>

      <para>Provision was not made originally inthe 1945 Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement for the sale of dwellings on terms. By amendment of that Agreement in 1955 each of the States concerned was authorised to sell dwellings on terms requiring a minimum deposit of five per cent ofthe first $4,000 of the purchase price plus 10 per cent of the balance, subject to a maximum loan of $5,500. The minimum deposit in respect of bouses built under the 1945 Agreement remained the same until 1961 when a further amendment permitted each State to fix its own terms of sale. Queensland then continued to require a minimum deposit of 5 per cent of the first $4,000 plus 10 per cent of the balance of the purchase price, but without any fixed limit of maximum loan; each of the other States determined that the terms of sale (including minimum deposit) would be the same as for sale of 1956 Housing Agreement dwellings (see ii below). </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>and  (2)  The information which follows was provided by the State housing authorities to my Department, which sought their assistance in furnishing details for the Honourable Member - </para>
            </item>

          <para>New South Wales - The following table shows the waiting times for rental accommodation in two, three and four bedroom cottages from  1961  to </para>
          <para>1970. </para>
          <para class="block">Since its inception the Government Housing Scheme in New South Wales has been designed primarily to cater for the needs of those people in the low and middle income brackets who, because of various factors, experience difficulty in solving their own housing problem. In more recent years greater emphasis has been placed on determining whether or not an applicant can reasonably be expected to provide bis own accommodation from within the private sector of the housing industry. Arbitrary standards based on family income, which may automatically exclude persons who do not meet those standards, have not been laid down. </para>
          <para>Responsibility for determining eligibility rests with independent Housing Applications Committees established in all centres in which the Housing Commission has undertaken construction of homes. In assessing the applicant&#39;s ability to satisfy his own housing need a Committee has regard to the availability and price level of accommodation, for both rental and purchase, in the private sector and relates this information to the family income, assets and liabilities of members of the family and any outer special factors considered relevant. </para>
          <para>If it is decided that an applicant should be able to satisfy his housing need privately, his application is not admitted to the waiting list and the position is explained to him. Otherwise, his name is admitted to the list for allocation of accom modation in due course when his turn is reached. All decisions of the Committees are made on the understanding that if there is any significant change in an applicant&#39;s circumstances, the decision will be carefully reconsidered. In addition, policy provides that the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to eligibility must be extended in the applicant&#39;s favour. </para>
          <para>Victoria - Due to the Slum Reclamation programme in the Melbourne metropolitan area the trend has been towards providing flat accommodation for rental and making houses available for purchase on low depotit Large families of five or more children receive priority for houses vacated and are allocated these homes on a tenancy basis; currently a wait of between  18  months and two years is usual. For tenancy of a two bedroom flat the waiting time is currently about six months and for a three bedroom flat between  12  and  15  months. </para>
          <para>In country centres, as far as practicable homes are made available on the basis of  50%  for sale and  50%  for rental. The waiting time in the country varies from almost immediate bousing to quite lengthy delays, due to factors such as employment opportunities, availability of private homes and migration intake, </para>
          <para>A means test is imposed to determine eligibility for rental accommodation or for purchase of a Housing Commission home. The means test </para>

        </para>
        <para>Queensland - Tenancies of StateRental houses are allotted on a points priority system which takes into account family circumstances such as facing ejectment from present accommodation, living in premises condemned by local authorities, separation owing to lack of accommodation, living under overcrowded conditions or sharing with other people, and number of children in the family. Statistics are not maintained of waiting time which depends not only on the priority category of the application but also on the circumstances in the town where accommodation is required. It has not been considered necessary to apply a specific means test as it has been found in practice that applications to the Housing Commission for State Rental accommodation come from the low and middle income sections of the community and that persons of higher income obtain accommodation from other sources. </para>
        <para>South Australia - Waiting time is affected by locality and the vacancy rate fromexisting rental houses in certain localities. The approximate waiting time for rental housing in the Adelaide metropolitan area over the past 10 years has been as follows: </para>

        <para>Launceston . . 6-9 months </para>
        <para>North West Coast . . 12-15 months </para>
        <para class="block">From 1 July 1969 to date the only variation from the above is a lengthening of the period for Launceston to 9-12 months. </para>
        <para>Details of waiting periods between 1961 and 1968 are not available but approximately they were 6-12 months throughout the four major centres of Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. </para>
        <para>No means test is applied provided an applicant is eligible for Government housing assistance within the terms of the State Homes Act, which defines an eligible person as one who (a) is married; (b) is about to be married; or (c) has dependants for whom it is necessary for him to provide a home. </para>

              <para>The Executive of CSIRO has made a preliminary report to me, outlining serious practical drawbacks it sees in this proposal of the Committee. The Executive&#39;s view is that the establishment of a large single Division of Air Pollution within CSIRO would not be as effective a means of working on this, or on other environmental problems, as would continuation of the present practice under which each individual project is tackled in the laboratory in which the relevant expertise is most highly developed. For example, some problems on air pollution an essentially problems in the study of air movement and in the dissemination of polluted air masses into the general atmosphere; additional CSIRO research on this topic would be most effectively carried out in die Division of Meteorological Physics, where the relevant expertise and a range of related research is being studied. Similarly, since Australian coal presents special difficulties in the control and reduction of fly ash emission from power stations, research on this problem is being conducted as part of the fuel research programme of the CSIRO Division of Mineral Chemistry at Ryde. The Executive is examining the whole matter in further detail and will report again to mc in due course. </para>

              <para>(2) Beforea decision was taken, the Government considered an analysis of the likely costs and benefits arising from the construction of a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. however, it will be necessary to revise this analysis when tenders for the Nuclear Steam Supply System have been received and assessed by the Atomic Energy Commission and its consultants. The initial analysis was prepared by the Commission on the basis of a continuing study of the developing costs of nuclear power throughout the world and the translation of this data to Australian conditions. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The costs of electric power, conventional or nuclear depend upon many factors such as the type of station, its location, its capital cost, whether it will meet base load or peak demands, whether it is a single or multi unit station; upon its fuel costs, interest rates, penalties to be met for the avoidance of pollution and other factors. The impact of these factors is different for conventional and for nuclear stations and therefore a simple comparison of the Jervis Bay Station with a conventional station is not possible. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s general conclusion was that a first nuclear station, which would have great value in establishing this new technology in Australia and the opportunities for training and experience which this would provide, would deliver power at an acceptable cost. Initially on a straight generation costs basis, the Jervis Bay Station is not expected to be competitive with a contemporary, coal-fired station of similar size, both operating on base load and with present day fuel and other costs. The difference is expected to be small but will not be known until tenders have been assessed. However any cost disadvantage could be more than offset by other benefits, depending on the relative movement of certain costs, a nuclear stationshould show an economic advantage over a conventional station. </para>

              <para>Yes. Nuclear power stations using natural or enriched uranium produce isotopes of plutonium during their operation. The quantity and isotopic composition produced will be dependant upon the reactor type selected and the fuel management programme adopted. The plutonium produced will ultimately be recovered for use in a fast breeder reactor programme which is likely to produce the lowest costs of power. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>A simple answer in quantitative terms is not practicable but in broad terms it can be stated that the estimated cost of electricity, from the Jervis Bay Station is expected to be somewhat higher than the large very favourably placed coal fired units at present being erected in New South Wales: it will, however, likely be lower than those of many stations which have been operating in the other States for some time. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Given that no major changes occur in the trends of costs of both conventional and nuclear stations the short answer is that nuclear stations will be economical when the electricity systems in the respective States are large enough to absorb larger units; this is likely to be the case in some States in the mid-1980&#39;s but will vary from State to State. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>I  should perhaps explain that electricity costs decrease with increasing plant size but the decreases are far more rapid with nuclear stations. It is not, however, feasible to integrate in the State systems at present, nuclear plants whose size would otherwise make them economic, as, for technical reasons, it is inadvisable for any unit to be larger than about 10% of the size of the total system. </para>

              <para>The station is to be owned and controlled by the Commonwealth (although operated in conjunction with the Electricity Commission of New South Wales). For this and for Constitutional reasons it was preferable that it should be sited in Commonwealth Territory. Fortunately it was found that the Jervis Bay site was very suitable in that it met requirements for availability of cooling water, proximity to present and future load centres and favourable construction cost factors in relation to topography, geology, transport and access. </para>

              <para>As South Australia prospectively has relatively high fuel costs, it will no doubt be attracted to nuclear power in due course. However, the States electrical system is at present too small to accept the size of a unit at which nuclear costs are competitive; thus it has no present need for a reactor. No doubt when the need arises a suitable site will be found. </para>

            <para>The Australian Atomic Energy Commission has always been active in seeking to promote a better public understanding of atomic energy. Recently the emphasis has mainly been on nuclear power, and a large exhibition explaining power reactor systems, engineering and economic aspects of nuclear power, and fuel development, is being shown at the Sydney Town Hall. It was shown in Canberra last September. </para>
            <para>The Commission endeavours to meet all requests for speakers; in the past year over 30 addresses dealing with nuclear power have been given to community organisations, clubs and professional groups, and others are scheduled. </para>
            <para>Detailed records are not kept of all information given out, but the following, while not exhaustive, will indicate the extent of the Commission&#39;s efforts. </para>
            <para>The Commission has held four exhibitions dealing with nuclear power in NSW, Canberra and Victoria, and it has equipped a mobile caravan dealing with Jervis Bay, which will shortly be making a tour of the Nowra area. In September it will visit Adelaide and several towns in NSW, and will later be shown in other metropolitan and country centres. A public Information Centre has been built at the Lucas Heights Research Establishment and will be open in July, and next year an Information Centre will be built at Jervis Bay. </para>
            <para>The Commission has published two booklets for general distribution, and the last three issues of its quarterly journal have contained progress reports on Jervis Bay. </para>
            <para>Three articles by Commissioners or Commission staff have been published in leading newspapers and periodicals, and four others have been promised in the next few months. Fourteen Press statements have been issued. </para>
            <para>On 3 occasions the  Chairman  and officers of the Commission gave extensive breifings of Jervis Bay to groups of visitors to the Commission&#39;s Research Establishment, including Press. </para>
            <para>Two Press visits have been arranged to the Jervis Bay site and many Press, radio and T.V. interviews given. From time to time individual correspondents have called at the Commission&#39;s Head Office on nuclear power, and telephone enquiries are answered every day. </para>
            <para>In March 1971, the Commission is organising a major symposium dealing with the type of reactor selected for Australia. It will be attended by experts from Commission staff, universities, and from other leading countries. </para>

              <para>No. There is no provision in the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969 for the payment of grants to local authorities. However, subject to broad limitations arising from the requirement that the major portion of the roads grants have lo be expended on certain prescribed categories of roads or on planning and research, State governments may, at their discretion, allocate any portion of their grants to local authorities. Further, the Commonwealth Act does not prevent Slate governments from allocating their own funds to local authorities for expenditure on rural roads. </para>

          <para>The honourable member may be referring to the Commonwealth grant for expenditure on rural roads, other than rural arterial roads&#39;. The 1969-70 grant for these roads was determined by increasing by 5% the amount which each State government was required to spend on secondary rural roads from the Commonwealth grant provided under the previous Act in 1968-69. The grant for rural roads other than arterial roads for the remaining years of the current legislation increases by <inline font-style="italic">5% per</inline> annum. However, this is not the only Commonwealth grant for rural roads under the new legislation. For the first time the Commonwealth is also making a grant specifically for rural arterial roads and, over the five years ending. June 1974, this grant will total almost $187 million. This means that, including the grant for rural roads other than arterial roads, Commonwealth grants specifically for expenditure on roads in rural areas for the five years will be over $581 million. In <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> five years &#39; ending June 1.969 the total of Commonwealth grants specifically allocated for rural roads-that is, for secondary rural roads only - was $300 million. In the case of New South Wales, in the current five years Commonwealth grants for rural arterial roads will total almost $64 million and for other iwa! roads almost $110 million: in the previous quinquennium the Commonwealth grant to New South Wales for secondary rural roads was less than $84 million. </para>

            <para>I understand the turnout lime for a permanent brigade in South Australia is well under one minute. Naturally for a volunteer fire brigade the turnout time is longer and depends on the lime it takes volunteers to reach the Station. In the case of the &#39;Amanda Miller&#39; fire the time from the sounding of the city alarm to turning out was about four to five minutes. </para>

            <para>- The answer to he honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is necessary to say, as background that the Army Headquarters Survey Regiment al present occupies an old mansion in Bendigo, built some 100 years ago. It is forced to use converted stables, an ore-crushing battery, attics and galvanised iron huts, supplemented by some modern buildings to meet essential accommodation and working needs. It has been the intention for several years to move the unit and since 1961 expenditure for the area has been confirmed to essential new buildings which could be amortised over the expected period of occupation. </para>
          <para>The re-location of this Regiment at Bonegilla would allow common facilities to be shared wilh the School of Survey and the Army Headquarters Survey Depot. Economics which would follow are: </para>
        </answer>
        <para class="block">Administrative </para>
        <para>The pay. personnel records, claims, rations, transport, quartermaster services, technical and accommodation stores, messes, canteens and recreational areas for these units would be combined, with consequent savings in the number of staff required to carry out these functions. The colocation of the units would bring some 60% of the total Corps strength together with a consequent reduction in postings and movement, an important consideration of family welfare. </para>
        <para class="block">Technical lite appropriate place for lithographic training is the School of Survey. At present the high cost of lithographic equipment forces the Corps to train personnel at the Regiment. To set up a small yet satisfactory lithographic training wing at the School of Military Survey, when divorced from the AHQ Survey Regiment, would cost in the vicinity of $350,000. This expenditure is unnecessary when the units are in the same location. Additionally co-location will permit the School to undertake full-time theoretical courses and use the Regiment&#39;s equipment for practical training. </para>
        <para>The School is also responsible for Corps research and development but the expensive equipment needed for this purpose is used on production at the Regiment. This equipment would become available to the School on co-location. The responsibility of research and development covers the whole field of mapping from survey to lithography. </para>
        <para>The cost of duplication of the first order photogrammetric equipment, would be approximately $500,000. This expenditure cannot be justified on equipment to be used on research and development, yet without access to this equipment through co-location research and development will be seriously retarded. </para>
        <para>Over the past 5 years, and in conjunction with Commonwealth and State Authorities a photogrammetric test range has been established at Bonegilla for testing and calibrating survey equipment. Additionally a complex of accurate surveys has been established to test students&#39; results. These facilities would - be available <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Regiment al Bonegilla but could not be duplicated at Bendigo even if suitable terrain existed without duplication of the 5 year joint effort that has gone into the establishment of the present range. </para>
        <para>Airborne measuring equipment, technical records and reproduction material would be centrally stored. </para>
        <para class="block">Logistic </para>
        <para>There is sufficient Army-owned land at Bonegilla to accommodate the Survey Regiment, the School of Survey and the AHQ Survey Depot. </para>
        <para>Bandiana nearby, has a major army complex with facilities, particularly workshops and a supply depot, which would be used by Bonegilla units. </para>
        <para>The movement of bulk printing paper to the Regiment on the one hand and printed maps to the Survey Depot on the other would be eliminated. </para>
        <para>Bonegilla has direct rail, road and air communication with capital cities leading to savings in time in the movement of personnel and stores. </para>

          <para class="block">There are also different types of centres catering to the needs of young children and it is difficult in some cases to determine which should be classified as &#39;Pre-schools&#39; and which as other centres. For example, in Victoria there is a significant number of &#39;play centres&#39; conducted by pre-school play leaders who have less training than kindergarten teachers and are permitted to care for no more than 15 children at the one time. By contrast the nursery schools and child-minding centres which have been set up in a number of Slates do not normally offer a recognised educational programme, and the children are normally left in the care of nurses rather than teachers. </para>

              <para>and (4) Boththe Commonwealth Statistician and the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as part of their normal work, regularly seek further details of education and other social services expenditure from State authorities. In June 1969 the Grants Commission sought information from the Slate Education Departments on education expenditure by the Stales on non-government schools. At the lime of my predecessor&#39;s answer, some States had not supplied full details of such expenditure but 1 am informed that the Commission has now obtained sufficient data on this matter. Some Slates have not supplied details of their expenditure on pre-schools, but the Commission does not require these for its purposes. However, the Commonwealth Statistician has given some attention to this matter since the dale of my predecessor&#39;s answer and, from a limited investigation, has been ableto compile approximate figures of expenditure by the State Governments on preschools defined so as to exclude expenditure on day nurseries and child minding centres, but including expenditure on play centres. Figures for the last 5 years, based mainly on published information, but in one or two cases on information especially provided by State authorities, are set out in the table below. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>These figures do not include expenditure incurred by State education departments in respect of children attending government schools, with the special exception of expenditure on government pre-schools in Tasmania - see answer to (2). The expenditure shown, again with the exception of Tasmania, is mostly in the form of grants by Slate Governmentsto Kindergarten Unions or Associations. In interpreting these figures, it should be borne in mind that some Stale Governments might be said to be indirectly supporting pre-school educationto the extent that general purpose grants by them to local authorities would be availableto help finance expenditure by those authorities on pre-school education. </para>

              <para>Until the RAAF requirements have been thoroughly assessed against aircraft developments both in Australia and overseas it is not possible to state under what arrangements the replacement aircraft will be designed and manufactured, lt is the policy of the Government that every consideration be given to Australian design and production of Service aircraft where practicable. However, it should be borne in mind that for the more complex and sophisticated equipments the limited requirements of the RAAF reduce the possibility of total Australian development and manufacture. Consideration will also be given to design and manufacture on a collaborative basis between the Australian aircraft industry and an overseas manufacturer. </para>

            <para>In view of the wide range of natural disasters that have been experienced in Canada and the United States, the relief schemes operating in those countries involve a number of complex arrangements. This has necessitated rather more information to be acquired and more research to be undertaken than was envisaged when the project was first commenced in response to an earlier question by the Honourable Member. Partly because of this and partly because of staff shortages, the examination of the relief schemes operating in these two countries and New Zealand has not yet been completed. </para>

          <para>The recent increases in the maximum rates of interest which the Loan Council will approve for semi-government and local authority borrowings followed the increased rates applicable to the Commonwealth cash loan which closed on 14 May last. Rates for both Commonwealth and semigovernment and local authorities arc fixed by the Loan Council, of which the Commonwealth is a member. </para>
          <para>The matter of interest rates is one of concern to the Loa&#39;n Council and the recent increase in the long-term bond rate and in the rates payable by local authorities was made by the Council only aftercareful consideration of all relevant facts. It was considered, however, that interest rates payabb on public securities must be fixed competitively if significant amounts of money are to be raised on the market. It cannot therefore be said without qualification that the increase in interest rates would act as a deterrent to public investment. </para>
          <para>State semi-government and local authorities are within the control and responsibility of the respective State Governments.
