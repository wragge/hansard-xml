          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> it is with deep regret that I have to advise the House of the death in April 1970 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jim</inline> Fraser, member for the Australian Capital Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was bom in Derby, Tasmania, on 8 th February 1908. From 1927 to 1935 he was a teacher with the Victorian Education Department and in 1935 he took up journalism in New South Wales. In 1941 he enlisted in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, served in New Guinea from 1942 to 1943, and with the Public Relations Field Unit from 1944 to 1945. He was discharged with the rank of sergeant in March 1946. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> then joined the Department of the Interior and worked there until he became public relations officer for the Minister for Health in 1948. In 1949 he was appointed private secretary to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and he was also during that time a member of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council. </para>

        <para>In 1951 he was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for the Australian Capital Territory and he remained the member for this Territory for 19 years up to the time of his death. In the House he served on a number of committees and was vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. During the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was a member he won a well deserved reputation as a dedicated helper of the citizens of Canberra. He filled the role not only of a member of Parliament but also, as it were, of an ombudsman. He took up the cause of all who he felt had not been treated justly by officialdom and indeed he devoted himself to helping the citizens of Canberra as his major task as a parliamentarian. He, I believe, prevented injustice. He helped people to meet with those officials who could best deal with any problems which they had. The regard in which he was held </para>

          <para>- I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and on behalf of my Party express appreciation of what he said about our colleague. Jim Fraser was above all a representative. Probably no member of this House of Representatives took his title so literally, was so single-mindedly the representative of the people who elected him, which certainly does not mean merely the people who voted for him. Partly this was due to the nature of his position. He was not only member of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory but also he had to act as Canberra&#39;s mayor, senator and ombudsman. Even more, it was in his character, and part of his nature, to believe that the problems of the people - his people - were his own. He accepted that role enthusiastically, with all the burdens and all the frustrations it involved. The task involved was enormous. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In a city of officials he was the only elected one. In population it had become the largest electorate in Australia. It had the highest proportion of children. There can be no doubt about the response of the people of this city and his rapport with them. My own parents, like thousands of citizens of this Territory, had utter faith in .lim Fraser as a fellow citizen and a representative, lt would be proof enough to refer to the remarkable vote he achieved in the last election, but more humanly and more movingly there was the remarkable display at his funeral last Friday by the people of this city by all sections of this community - sometimes thought to be the most reserved and restrained in Australia. </para>
        <para>This is a city accustomed to great events and great personages, but it kept its warmest, most affectionate and most spontaneous expression of respect for me of its own - Jim Fraser. This was a refutation of the cynical assessment often made of the role which can be filled by elected persons and of the attitude which can be shown by the people to them. It was sometimes asserted that Jim Fraser was exclusively a local man. It should not be forgotten, however, that he had the most international, cosmopolitan constituency of any of us. Those of us who have travelled abroad officially will remember that in embassies around the world, wherever Australian diplomats and attaches are posted, affectionate regard would be sent through us to their local member. In the most official, affluent, sophisticated community in Australia there is the greatest need for an unaffected and accessible spokesman, mediator and advocate. Jim Fraser filled all those roles splendidly. I believe we in this House would know how much he owed to the precedent set, not least in Canberra, by his brother, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Allan Fraser)</inline> and his devotion to all matters affecting the rights of the citizens. </para>
        <para>Jim Fraser understood, as the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory must above all, the workings of government. He deeply respected the people who administer the business of government. Witnesses who appeared before him on the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory all testify to his fairness, his courtesy and his comprehension. I can say for myself - I believe I can say for each member here, and above all for thousands and thousands of people in this great city - he was my friend, faithful and just to me. </para>

          <para>- I desire to associate the parliamentary members of the Australian Country Party with the motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and seconded and supported by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> I join with the members of my Party in the tributes that have been paid by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition to the late Jim Fraser. He was indeed a most honourable and a most respected man. I suppose if any of us sought a tribute nothing could be higher than to have it said that one is honourable and respected in the judgment of one&#39;s fellows. This was the judgment of Jim Fraser by all parliamentarians and certainly by the community that he represented and served. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>most outstanding characterstic as a parliamentarian was his complete and single minded devotion to the interests of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. As I saw Jim Fraser over the years, his thoughts, first, second and last, were for the people whom he represented in this great city and he represented them during a period of quite dramatic development. I have ascertained that when he was elected in 1951 the population of the Australian Capital Territory was some 25,000 people and now it is more than 120,000 people. He gave the most complete satisfaction as a representative to the people of Canberra during that period. The community demonstrated on two quite recent occasions the great respect and affection in which Jim Fraser was held.  His  immense majority in the recent general election was itself evidence of this and the tremendous tribute that was paid to him by people of this city on the occasion of his funeral was the second great manifestation of this respect and affection. </para>
        <para>As has been said he was a kindly man. He was a completely trustworthy man. There was nothing petty about him at all. I am sure that Jim Fraser will be missed by the Parliament. He was a strong and good man. I join the members of the Australian Country Party in this tribute to him and extend the sympathies of my colleagues to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Fraser,</inline> her son and Jim Fraser&#39;s brother, our colleague Allan Fraser. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I had a deep admiration for the late Jim Fraser as a friend, as a colleague in Caucus, as a husband and as a father. Jim Fraser surpassed in each of these aspects of life the rigorous standards that should be imposed on all men. lt was in Caucus for 17 years that I knew him best. We were together in some turbulent times but in all those times Jim Fraser exhibited the same excellent qualities of character that he exhibited everywhere else that he moved. He was a man of independent and determined thoughts.  His  decisions were made after thorough consideration and having made them he was never swayed by any type of pressure. He stood straight against any odds. He was beholden to no man; yet was a man of extreme good will. He expressed ail his opinions openly and forthrightly and granted the same privilege to those of different thoughts. He was a true Labor man as his parliamentary life has shown. </para>

          <para>- I would like to add my tribute to that of other honourable members who have spoken. As Minister for the Interior I came into constant contact with Jim Fraser over the many problems affecting the people of the Australian Capital Territory. He exhibited a humaneness, an interest, a patience, a real understanding and genuine concern for people and for their worries. He achieved a great deal for individuals and for families in Canberra. When it was not possible to obtain satisfaction for a constituent he did not just blame the department or the Government but would patiently explain the reasons to his constituent until that person had a proper understanding. This honesty won the respect of the officers of my Department and the public of Canberra. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Jim Fraser had a real understanding of the difficulties of administration but at the same time fought with zeal to uphold the rights of individuals and was tireless in his endeavours. He brought to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory an invaluable local knowledge. He served the people of Canberra and their Parliament with distinction. It was for all these reasons, and for many others, that a mass of people turned up at the funeral service and lined the roadway to pay a last tribute to Jim Fraser. </para>
        <para>For my part, I enjoyed a rare understanding and friendship with him. I join with other honourable members in extending sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Fraser</inline> and Andrew, to Allan and to the rest of the family in their great loss. </para>

          <para>- I would like to join with other honourable members who have paid a tribute to the late Jim Fraser. As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I knew him well and 1 greatly admired not only his capacity for work but also the diligence with which he applied himself to representing his constituents, both inside this House and outside it. I believe that it can be said of most members of this House that they are clearly identified in the minds of the public with either a particular subject or subjects or with the political parties to which they belong, or both. But it can truly be said of Jim Fraser that he was identified with his electorate. He was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Canberra.</inline></para>

        <para>I am quite sure that a great many people who reside in the Australian Capital Territory were not aware of his political affiliations but knew that if they had a problem Jim Fraser was the man to see. The thousands of people who attended either the service at St Andrews or at the cemetery, or who lined the road to the cemetery, were there to pay their respects not to an office but to a person - the late Jim Fraser. I think if it can ever be said of any member of Parliament that he resided in the hearts of his electors it can be said of Jim Fraser. </para>
        <para>He will be missed by a great many people in all walks of life and in all sections of the community. I would like to extend to his widow, his son, his brother and the other members of his family my very deep sympathy. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the extent of the respect and affection shown for my brother and the honour accorded to him in death is deeply appreciated by all his family. It is a source of much comfort to his wife, Helen, and it will be a source of much pride to his son, Andrew, as he grows to manhood to realise the high regard in which his father was held. No-one close to Jim could be unmoved by the tributes paid to him here this afternoon and I know that Helen is grateful for them and grateful for every act of courtesy and consideration shown both during his illness and since. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I carried to Jim in hospital many messages from colleagues on both sides of this chamber and I would like honourable members to know that he was glad to get each of these messages - he quite valued them. He knew that his illness was mortal and he had known that since the morning after the exploratory operation. He continued to take a keen and cheerful interest in parliamentary doings. He laughed and joked with those around him and it is simple fact to say that no-one heard from him one word of grumbling or self-pity at his fate. </para>
        <para>As has been said, Jim will be missed for many reasons in this chamber. An incidental thing which 1 recall now is his gift of repartee and bis well-timed and often humorous interjections. In this respect - and it may be that I am coloured by brotherly pride - I think he ranked with Frank Anstey and Frank Brennan who were remarkable figures in this Parliament in the days of my youth. I cannot add anything further to what has been so generously and adequately said this afternoon. I thank the House for the references in which I have been included. We have been the only brothers ever to sit together in this House and we have been very close to each other.

            <para>- My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he know that the Australian Broadcasting Commission and other news sources are referring to the visit of the Royal family as &#39;the Royal tour of Australia&#39;? Would he agree that as the tour does not include one-third of the continent, namely Western Australia, it is hardly a tour of Australia? As the Royal family is spending about 5 weeks in Australia, mainly in New South Wales and Victoria, would he even at this late stage try to get the Royal family to go to Western Australia even for a short visit? </para>

            <para>- I think it is not inappropriate to describe the tour as a tour of Australia though it could not be described as a tour of the whole of Australia. I would agree with that part of what the honourable member says. I think the honourable member and the House generally will understand the calls that are made upon the Royal family on a tour of this kind and that, though they may well like to attend every part of Australia, it is in the time they are able to make available impossible for them to do so, and their wishes and the requirements of the Royal tour director must be taken into account in this respect. I think I should point out that the Royal family is visiting, not only New South Wales and Victoria, but also Queensland and Tasmania. I am sure that they would regret, as we would regret, that they are unable to visit Western Australia on this occasion, but I trust that the honourable member will understand the reasons for this and will not seek to level any criticism as a result of it. </para>

            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that the allocation of funds for loans to ex-servicemen for the purchase of homes for the current year has been exhausted? Is he also aware that there are several hundred applications for loans which have been approved and that contracts for the purchase of homes have been entered into but that no money is available? The Prime Minister will realise that if these are facts a great number of exservicemen will be placed in the position that they will have to borrow bridging finance at excessively high rates of interest to complete their transactions while they are awaiting the availability of their loan from the War Service Homes Division. Will the Prime Minister consider making available an immediate special grant to the War Service Homes Division to enable it to complete the transactions referred to? </para>

            <para>- In reply to the first part of the question, yes, I am aware that the funds available for war service homes during this financial* year have now been spent. I might point out to the House that during this financial year the Government made available for war service homes a sum of $55m, which is $5m more than the year before. As the honourable member said, this increased amount has already been spent. </para>

              <para>- As 1 was pointing out, the result of this is that those who have applications to buy existing buildings and who would normally have received their loans in May or June will now have to wait until July. T would suggest that it is unlikely to lead to any significant requirement for bridging finance - this delay of some 6 or 8 weeks. I would like to add to that that those who are applicants for loans for building their own nouses, as distinct from buying existing buildings, will not in any way be affected by the matter which the honourable member has raised. </para>

The Post Office does not have a view in relation to articles which are placed in the mail, provided they are in conformity with the regulations of the Post and Telegraph Act. The only discrimination which the Post Office is allowed in this connection is in relation to articles which are blasphemous, indecent, etc. I do not know the precise wording of the legislation. Honourable members should appreciate that the Post Office, unless it is suspicious that this type of material is going through the mail, has no right whatever to open the mail. </para>

No doubt the Minister has seen reports that the French Government plans to resume the testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere at its test site near Tahiti in the near future.

            <para>- Recently the Australian Government was advised that the French Government had decided to continue nuclear tests in the Pacific area close to Tahiti. We have since advised the French Government officially that we object to the tests being carried out. We did so for two reasons. Firstly we think it is unfortunate that when considerable thought is still being given to a comprehensive nuclear test ban the partial nuclear test ban treaty should be defied. We regard it as a fundamental step towards outlawing the use of nuclear weapons completely and as a basic step towards total disarmament, if they can ever be achieved practically. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is a second reason. We believe that the people in the Pacific area are entitled to lead their lives free from the fear of atomic fallout or some sort of harm to their way of living. We are not able to say exactly what kind of test it will be, but we have expressed our very deep regret to the </para>
          <para class="block">French Government that it should find it necessary to carry out any kind of atmospheric test in this area. We do hope that the French Government will take some notice of our protests and those of other governments. </para>

The right honourable gentleman drew an analogy between EPIC and the proposed Corporation, pointing out that EPIC had also been attacked as a Socialistic measure but claiming that it was a sound business venture&#39;. I ask: Now that the Minister is a convert to Democratic Socialism, is he planning to promote some other government or semi-government institutions?

            <para>- Like all other advanced Western countries the United Kingdom has a policy of support for its agricultural industries. It is customary for it to make an annual review of the amount of that support. This review was conducted recently and the results have been announced. I do not carry in my mind the figures for the individual items but there have been substantial increases for nearly every item - for wheat, barley, beef and milk to mention some. I think the price support for beef is more than &#163;stg11 per cwt live weight. Those who are concerned with livestock industries will realise what an extremely high price support this is. Similar provisions have been made for other agricultural and livestock items. I think it would bc better if I treated the question as being on notice. I will supply the honourable member and thereby other honourable members with a full and detailed reply to the question. </para>

            <para>- I do not know quite how I can order an investigation into an unsupported allegation from the Federal  President  of the Australian Labor Party - an allegation which has no supporting evidence whatever. Indeed, I would somewhat doubt whether an allegation of that kind from that source ought to be dignified by an inquiry of this kind; but I would, in view of the question which the honourable member has asked, take this opportunity to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that he might, in support of this offensive allegation, put forward publicly any evidence he has and name any members of the Federal Parliament to whom he is referring. If he does not do that, the Australian public will be able to judge the force and veracity of what he has to say. If he does make these things public, and I am sure he will not, then I would certainly seek to investigate them. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister for Social Services. I preface my question by saying that there is a disparity in the purchasing power of pensions in the Northern Territory compared with their purchasing power in the south, because the recognised cost of living is about onethird higher in the far north than it is in the southern cities and settled areas. I ask: Will the Minister give consideration to my continued representations for a district allowance to offset the northern pensioners&#39; disadvantage? </para>

            <para>- This is a matter of policy which will be considered at its appropriate time in the Budget context. May I say, however, that it has been the settled policy not only of this Government but also of its predecessors that social service rates shall be uniform throughout Australia. It is perfectly true that, in remote areas, particularly the Northern Territory, some costs of living are higher than elsewhere. On the other hand, in a warm climate, as it is up there, certain costs of living are lower. In point of fact, an inquiry was made into this situation and the disparity is not as great as it would be thought to be at first glance, although a disparity does exist. That is all that I can say on this matter which concerns policy and where there is a long established procedure and principle which have been followed by this Government and set by its predecessors. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I address to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Bennelong in regard to war service homes.In reply to the honourable gentleman, the Prime Minister said that $50m had been spent on war service homes this year. Is the Prime Minister aware that the report this financial year of the War Service Homes Division discloses that the income the Government receives from war service homes is in excess of $70m? Is the Prime Minister aware also many Vietnam veterans who have made application for homes have been informed that they must get the finance to bridge the gap between their money and the cost of the home and that they are paying from 14% to 20% in interest rates? I ask the Prime Minister: Will he make money available immediately from war service homes revenue or instruct the Commonwealth Bank to make bridging gap loans available to these young men so that they may get a home without suffering the infringement of these exorbitant usurers rates to build a home? </para>

              <para>- That is what 1 am informed. 1 am informed that it will have some effect on those who are seeking to buy existing buildings whether they are brand new or not. It will have some effect on those seeking to buy existing buildings and the effect, as I have pointed out to the House, will be this: On the information provided to me these applicants - and there are some hundreds of them - would normally have received their loans in May or June. They will now be required to wait until July. It is difficult to believe that this period of delay of some 6 or 8 weeks would require, in most cases, bridging finance to be negotiated or that it would make any significant difference in that period of time if this were to happen. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for External Affairs. I ask: Is a balanced presentation of Australia&#39;s commitment in Vietnam and South East Asia important to this country&#39;s association with its allies? If so, does the Minister view with concern the distorted impression which the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign, heavily organised and influenced by Communists, will project concerning Australia&#39;s position? Is this particularly so in view of the individual identification of so many members of the Australian Labour Party with the proposed Campaign? Finally, is not this concern even more urgent as personal support was assured to the Campaign by the Leader of  Her  Majesty&#39;s Opposition at a meeting of unions affiliated with the Queensland Trades and Labour Council held in late February at the Brisbane Trades Hall? </para>

              <para>- I am glad that by its reaction the Opposition identifies itself here. Its obvious reaction illustrates the wide difference that exists between the Opposition and the Government. We are there to protect freedom and decency and the right of those people to look after themselves free from intimidation and from aggression from outside. As to the objectives of the Moratorium Campaign, what is of significance is that it urges the immediate withdrawal not only of Australian troops but of foreign troops and it does not specify that the foreign troops include the invading forces of North Vietnam. So anyone who participates in this kind of moratorium march, or whatever else it might be, is therefore, unless, some correction can be made, supporting the forces of aggression and supporting those who want South Vietnam to be dominated by other countries rather than by the people of the country itself. </para>

          <para>As to a balanced presentation, 1 believe that other countries will take little or no notice of the moratorium marchers. By way of illustration I can point to the failure of the moratorium marchers in the United States of America towards the end of last year. The final march was abandoned because the marchers found that the silent majority were strongly expressing their resentment to what the left wing minority in that country were doing. Consequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, you</inline> are entitled to think they will do the same in this country if they get the opportunity to do so. As to the meeting attended by the Leader of the Opposition, I have been informed that he did attend a meeting of the Queensland Trades and Labour Council. </para>

The answer to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is: No, I have not been advised of what the Leader of the Opposition claims to be the fact. Nor do I think it has great relevance to the real fact that during this financial year the amount of money made available for war service homes has been increased by 10% over the amount available for the last financial year and that as a result of this and as a result of the great use that has been made of it there will merely be the inconvenience of some 6 or 8 weeks wait for those seeking to buy new homes, which will not prevent them from buying these new homes as is suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General without very much notice. He will no doubt recall the persuasive reasons advanced by his predecessor when he introduced the Commonwealth Superior Court Bill 1968 on 21st November of that year, which Bill provided for the establishment of a Commonwealth Superior Court. I ask the Attorney-General whether the arguments advanced on that occasion are still valid, whether there is still a need for a Commonwealth Superior Court and, if so, what course he proposes to follow to have such a Court established. </para>

            <para>- I think I should begin my answer by commending the honourable member for his engaging frankness. But to put the matter briefly, this whole question is under my consideration. It is a very large question and I shall make up my mind about this proposal, or about what I may recommend concerning it, in the light of existing circumstances, which are not altogether the same as they were in 1968 when the Bill to which the honourable member refers was introduced. This question does touch a matter of policy and beyond saying it is under my consideration I do not propose to say anything else. </para>

Is he aware that his Department recently issued a backgrounder research paper on Laos in which was included amongst a list of reference books, one entitled &#39;Mekong Upstream&#39; by W. G. Burchett? Did the Department act with his approval? Is the author of &#39;Mekong Upstream&#39; the same W. G. Burchett who was recently permitted to enter Australia by his Government? If so, did the Minister or his Department have any discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Burchett</inline> when he was here on the situation in Laos?

            <para>- 1 ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question with respect to the Vietnam Moratorium. In view of the fact that it is publicised that a large number of Federal Labor Party members of Parliament have signed support for the moratorium, as have also a large number of members of the Communist Party of Australia, could he give the reasons why the Trades Hall Council in Victoria, and I believe also those in Tasmania and New South Wales, have repudiated this call? Is it because of the association with the Communist Party? If not, what are the reasons? </para>

            <para>- In answer to the honourable gentleman&#39;s question: It is a fact that an organisation has been established to endeavour to persuade the public of Australia that there is some sort of movement here to protest against Vietnam involvement which is separate and distinct and indigenous to Australia. The truth is, of course, that that movement stems directly from overseas. It has been stimulated without any doubt by </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Communist manoeuvring. There is no doubt that there are people in Australia seeking to use this force that originates overseas. The great misfortune about it is that there are a number of people in Australia who are thought to be the victims of a propaganda move which will bring them into association with the movement in an attempt to make it appear widespread and to make it appear respectable. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, there are members of the Australian Labor Party, in the Parliamentary Party as well as in the organisational Party, who are not mere dupes but who have willingly given their support to it.  1  regret to say that organised Labor in Australia has endorsed the Vietnam moratorium, &#91;n order for that primary action to become the policy it is necessary for more than  50%  of the Trades and Labour Councils to endorse it. Three have failed to endorse it. One of the members on the other side, in taking a point of order, asked how could I know what is in the minds of those people who refuse to endorse it. T think I do know what is in their minds. They are decent Australians who will have no part of it and that is the reason why they refused to endorse this action. </para>
          <para>But this has become a matter going beyond the mere political polemics. This has become an issue in which one of the members of the front bench of the Opposition has issued a call - a clarion call he would like to think it - to the Australian people and particularly to those in Victoria and in Melbourne, to cease work, to occupy the streets and to occupy public buildings. It is an invitation to anarchy as properly described, lt is a matter of such importance that I expect that a statement will be made by a Minister in this House so that the matter can be properly debated so that the views which are held by honourable members in this House can be exposed; for I am quite sure that whatever certain members of the Parliamentary Labor Party believe their views are not the views of the great bulk of those people who vote Labor and who support the Labor Party. Those people who will be called upon in the future to vote ought to know the character of the people they are called upon to vote for. For that reason there will be debate on this matter in the House. </para>

Did the honourable gentleman say, as reported in the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; on 6th January, that he would not turn around and put his name to a form of words which smacked of perjury and which was against his plain belief and complete conviction? Did he say further: &#39;Any criticism should be directed to me.

            <para>- f think this is a splendid illustration of erring in the reading of a statute. When I first read the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act and references made in section  39  (2.) (b) of that Act to the Board&#39;s making a decision regarding the acceptance of an application to meet the needs of the Service, T took the view - and 1 am sure that my honourable friend would agree with me that it was a reasonable one to take - that the &#39;Board&#39; in that sense was the Naval Board, but the &#39;Board&#39; in that sense T found on further examination was the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Board. This is a Board that occupies by force of statute of this Parliament a statutory independence. The Board exercises a role which is akin to that of a board of trustees. I was invited by dint of circumstances to place before that Board all the relevant facts concerning Captain Stevenson, lt is not a case <inline font-style="italic">of my</inline> changing my mind or of the Naval Board changing its mind although I pause to make the observation that if a person who has placed before him further relevant and persuasive argument refused to change his mind I would be left to conclude that that individual is not affected by elements of obstinacy but is consumed by stupidity. I want to point out to my honourable friend and to the House that the ultimate decision rests wilh the Defence Forces Retirement </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Benefits Board. It is the Board&#39;s decision. It makes a decision whether to accept the retirement. It would have been within the Board&#39;s province and thoroughly competent for it to have turned around and said: &#39;No, we do not accept it.&#39; Then it would have been open to the Government to consider the matter on that basis. But that Board accepted it and there the matter rests. What the honourable gentleman has before him and what I have before me is the decision of a board which has statutory independence - an independence that has been enjoyed by that board for many, many years. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that honourable members appreciate the fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is set up under the Broadcasting and Television Act, which was passed by this Parliament. This Parliament gave to the Australian Broadcasting Commission almost complete autonomy in relation to programming. The film &#39;Son of Man&#39;, which has been referred to, was passed by the Commonwealth film censor in the same way that films which are seen in any cinema in Australia are approved. A week or so ago I gave a clear indication of the processes adopted by the ABC before the film was shown on television and the reasons why it was to he repeated. I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat those comments at this stage The ABC is entitled to make its own judgment on this matter. </para>

            <para>- by leave - I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that the Commonwealth Government has decided to make a grant of $53.8m - $US60m - in economic assistance to Indonesia for the 3 year period 1970-71 to 1972-73. In the current financial year 1969-70 the level of our assistance will be about $15m. The increase clearly shows the Government&#39;s desire to assist Indonesia&#39;s enormous developmental needs. Following the remarkable recovery of the Indonesian economy during the past 3 years it also shows the Government&#39;s confidence that assistance is being used effectively to promote economic development. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1966 the Suharto Government inherited an economy that was in great difficulties externally, with strong internal inflation and a declining productive sector. By 1969 inflation had been brought under control, exports were increasing and the productive sector was moving forward again. Credit for this dramatic improvement in the economy must be given to the sound policies of the Indonesian Government. These efforts have been backed by a flow of international assistance from Western donors. Indonesia is now in a position to move from the stabilisation stage into the development stage, which began with the five year development plan in 1969. </para>
          <para>The problems faced by Indonesia are still immense. The heavy legacy of economic neglect of earlier years will take time, resources and determination to overcome. Reflecting these needs and the greater opportunities for an effective attack on these problems, Western donors of the </para>
          <para class="block">Inter-governmental Group on Indonesia have endorsed the assessment by international agencies that Indonesia requires $US600m in assistance for the period up to 31st March 1971. This compares with a request for$US500m for 1969. Australia&#39;s commitment of $53. 8m forms a part of this international effort. Of course, it relates to a longer period than the $600m Indonesia requires up to 31st March 1971. In the past our aid commitments have been made, in accordance with our budgetary practices, on a year by year basis. However, this year we are making a commitment for 3 years, so that theIndonesian Government, with this forward knowledge, can integrate our aid commitment into its own planning. </para>
          <para>We envisage that our aid will be disbursed on a rising scale, so that expenditure will be greater in the last year of the 3 year period than in the first. As in the past this assistance will take the form of balance of payments support through what is called the B.E. or export bonus system, supply of commodities, including wheat flour, economic development projects, technical assistance and student training. As Indonesia turns from the immediate problems of stabilisation towards the longer term goal of economic growth, we think there will be a shift in our own programme with greater emphasis on project aid. </para>
          <para>We are continuing the current railway rehabilitation and telecommunications projects and in the coming year plan to start on projects for the renewal of town water supply systems in Bogor and Den Pasar. We are investigating in a preliminary way a projectto rehabilitate the port of Tjilatjap on the south coast of Java, where a number of Australian firms plan investment. </para>
          <para>I would like to mention the AustraliaAsia university aid and co-operation scheme. Whilst it is not financed from the Indonesian aid vote which I announced it is being directed principally to Indonesia. This programme is designed to set up a framework of co-operation between Australian universities and universities in Indonesia and also in Malaysia and Singapore. It will provide fellowships for research and staff training in Australia, travel awards for Australian university staff to work in the recipient universities and supply of library books and laboratory equipment. </para>
          <para class="block">Initially the scheme will concentrate on research and training associated with food production. This bilateral aid by Australia and other donors is being supplemented by assistance from the multilateral aid institutions to which Australia contributes, such as the International Development Association and the Asian Development Bank. </para>
          <para>I should add that none of Australia&#39;s aid is debt relief. This is simply because all our aid has been on a grant, not loan, basis. Thus, Australia is not one of Indonesia&#39;s creditors. But Australia shares Indonesia&#39;s concern that a satisfactory long term solution must be found to the huge international indebtedness inherited from the previous regime. If Indonesia is to succeed in the task of raising living standards, her creditors must reach a realistic settlement of these debts. This settlement must be within Indonesia&#39;s capacity to pay. Australia cannot stand back from the problems which Indonesia faces. Indonesia has been, and continues to be, the largest recipient of our bilateral aid outside Papua and New Guinea. I believe that the decision to give Indonesia $53. 8m over 3 years reflects the wish of all Australians to play their part in the international effort to assist our nearest neighbour in the task of raising the living standards of its 118 million people. I commend this to the House. </para>

            <para>- by leave - I will be referring to Indonesia in the resumed debate on international affairs but in the defence context and therefore I speak immediately on the economic aspects to which the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> has just referred. I thank the Minister for letting me have a copy of his statement some hours ago. 1 found this to be a courteous and helpful departure from the procedure followed on the last occasion a statement was made about economic aid to Indonesia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The decision to assist Indonesia by announcing a 3 year target for economic assistance is commendable. I noticed that yesterday afternoon newspapers referred to a major breakthrough in the offing. I think a scrutiny of the statement now shows that the projected target means a slackening in the rate of increase in aid to Indonesia at a time when Australia above all countries should be increasing economic assistance to its nearest neighbour. The quota set by the Minister for the 3 years is $53. 8m, which is an average of about $ 17.9m in each of the 3 years. In reply to a question that I asked last August the right honourable gentleman&#39;s predecessor disclosed that our aid for the calendar year 1969 was running at S 16.8m - an increase of S2.5m over the calendar year 1968. From the Minister&#39;s reference tonight to the current financial year&#39;s level of assistance being about $15m it would appear that there is a short fall in the taking up of aid. The starting point for purposes of comparison should be the calendar year figures. Setting these against the next 3 years target period we can see that the rate of increase in aid has sharply declined. In the calendar year 1969 aid increased by $2.5m, but the increase for the 3 years target figure averaged out at only $1.3m. </para>

              <para>- I will check the answer again in the light of the Minister&#39;s intervention. The Government cannot rely on the defence that Australian aid goes to Indonesia in grant form. The Netherlands - hardly a richer country than Australia - in 1969 gave approximately $22m in grants to Indonesia. It should also be remembered that the bonus export component of Australian aid - some $ 10.1m in 1969 - is directly tied to Australian purchases and thus provides benefits to Australian industry and exporters. Similarly, food aid totalling some $3.4m in 1969 also provided direct benefits to the Australian primary producer. Aid is, of course, a two way process but by stressing the grant aspect of the aid programme the Government does little to educate Australian public opinion to understand that aid helps the donor country as well. I believe that we need an imaginative review of our policy of aid to Indonesia. The establishment of a 3-year target should have provided the opportunity for such a review. It did not. It is a mixture as before. We were slow, too slow, to increase our aid programme to the new Indonesian regime. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Nevertheless we should now applaud the fact that whatever the amount may be - it will not make a great difference to Indonesia&#39;s economy - at least it will be known 3 years ahead and in good time. </para>

            <para>- Being a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia is one of the most satisfying jobs that I have had in the15 years that I have been in this Parliament. I would suggest to the Government and to all honourable members that members could well be used in a larger measure than is the case in enterprises of this kind. At the moment we have representation on the Australian National University and the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, but that is about all. The National Library is becoming one of the world&#39;s great library institutions. The membership of the Council includes a number of distinguished Australians and I regard it as an honour to be appointed by the House to this position. I commend the institution to honourable members. If they wish to make any inquiries at any time they may do so privately or even use the resources of Standing Orders at question time to do so. </para>

            <para>-  I congratulate the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> on the occasion of his first speech in that portfolio. I cannot congratulate him on its contents. The last time the Minister spoke in this House on international affairs was in October 1967. On that occasion, he denounced proposals for stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and negotiating with the National Liberation Front as &#39;treason&#39;. The Minister was then the most outspoken of those members of the Cabinet who used Australia&#39;s influence to sabotage American peace initiatives and prolong the war. We are not likely to have again such an opportunity for obtaining a settlement on anything like such satisfactory terms, not only for the Vietnams but for the Indo-China region, as we had in 1967. At that time Australia had considerable ability to influence events, by influencing the United States of America. We squandered that influence by abusing it. The Minister was among the foremost of the spendthrifts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One would have expected to see from the Minister some contrition - that necessary confession of failure which must precede amendment. We have nothing of the sort. On the contrary, the Minister clings to the old attitudes and theories which culminated in the present disaster in Indo-China. The Minister uttered some fine sentiments about the need for telling the people the truth - a pretty plain admission that they have not been told the truth in the past. The Minister is spokesman for the only democratic government in the world which would now dare depict the war in Vietnam and its origins exclusively in terms of external aggression. The Australian Government is the last to cling to this disastrous obsession. </para>
          <para class="block">Does it expect the Australian people to be the last in the world to believe it? The  President  of the United States knows that his people no longer believe it. In his Report to Congress on 18th February he studiously avoided the exploded claim that this war can or would ever be interpreted solely in terms of external aggression. Indeed, in that speech he paid tributes to both North Vietnam and NLF which, if uttered by an Australian, would be described by the Minister as treason. </para>
          <para>I say this interpretation of the war and its causes has been a disastrous obsession. Under its baleful influence, the conflict in Vietnam escalated into the longest and third largest war this century; it has been at the root of the massive blunders and massive bloodshed of this conflict; it has built up a tawdry totalitarian regime, running a fifthrate power, as the arbiter of Indo-China, while a hardly less totalitarian regime drags in its wake the prestige of the mightiest democracy the world has known or will ever know. Yet the Minister claims this policy - this policy allegedly designed to teach North Vietnam that aggression does not pay - is succeeding. The Minister is caught up in the toils of a terrible self contradiction. To justify 5 years of disaster in Vietnam, he says the policy pursued over those 5 years is a success; yet to explain events in Laos and Cambodia, he invokes the domino theory. Thus runs the Liberal syllogism: North Vietnam is being taught that aggression cannot succeed, but North Vietnam is extending her aggression to the whole of Indo-China. This is the Liberal logic: The domino theory will operate unless we succeed in Vietnam; we are succeeding in Vietnam; the domino theory is operating. </para>
          <para>The bankruptcy of Liberal policy, Liberal theories, Liberal attitudes is revealed in the most significant sentence in the Minister&#39;s speech. &#39;Cambodia&#39;, he says, &#39;does not fit readily into the themes I have developed in my statement&#39;. How impertinent of Cambodia! Events have an unfortunate habit of refusing to fit into Liberal themes. We do not hear much these days of the grand old rationale of our involvement in Vietnam - the need, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, to prevent the downward thrust of China between the Indian and Pacific oceans&#39;. The Minister himself 2 years ago drew a new McMahon line: &#39;Australia would fight aggression wherever . it occurred&#39;. Now, while explaining the situation in Laos and Cambodia wholly in terms of North Vietnamese aggression, he hurls his defiant thunderbolts about &#39;our sympathetic interest&#39;. </para>
          <para>The truth is that events in Cambodia fit perfectly into the most significant theme of Indo-China&#39;s history since World War II - the theme which explains the disasters which have befallen our aims, our arms and our efforts in that area. That theme is our continuing failure to recognise and identify with the national aspirations and expectations of the people of the area. At the bottom of the alienation of so many and so much representing the best in our communities is the failure to answer this crucial question of our time: Why is our cause, the cause of democracy - embracing mankind&#39;s hope for decency and dignity, backed as it is by unparalleled power - so vulnerable, and in this region so apparently impotent, in the face of the challenge of so obsolete, crude and brutal a creed as Communism? We began with all the advantages and still hold most of them. </para>
          <para>Look at our area in global perspective. Of the 12 significant countries of the Pacific Basin, 9 are democracies. The most developed, the strongest, of those - the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia - are flourishing democracies. Ten of these 12 countries reject Communism. Two of these - the United States and Japan - are the world&#39;s first and third industrial powers. Three of them - the U.S., Indonesia and Japan - are the world&#39;s fourth, fifth and sixth most populous nations. The two great Communist powers touching on the Pacific reserve for each other a greater hostility than they do for us. For 23 years Indian democracy has grappled successfully with the problems of the world&#39;s second most populous nation. In those same post-war years the overt military strength of the Soviet has been turned exclusively against other Communist nations. Yet, with all these strengths, we still find ourselves awaiting the next disaster. Surely then, only an Olympian capacity for error could have brought us to our present situation in this area. Cambodia illustrates and encapsules the fatal flaw of Western policy. </para>
          <para>The flaw is this: In this area especially, though not only in this area, we have allowed the Communists to identify with national leadership and national aspirations; in the name of anti-Communism, we have all too frequntly identified ourselves with all that is opposed to that leadership and those aspirations. We have preferred anti-national regimes who will profess opposition to Communism against nationalists who refused to do so. We have preferred nominal antiCommunism to neutralism. The whole Vietnam adventure was based on the gamble that a militant anti-Communist regime could be established there and on the fallacy that such a regime would be more to our advantage than a neutral government associating with none of the great adversaries. </para>
          <para>For 17 years in Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk dexterously kept his country neutral. He was an excellent diplomatist and a most excellent Prince. For all his faults, as in our superior detachment we may view them, he achieved the one thing worth achieving in his situation and for his nation: He maintained, he embodied, the national identity. I make no comment or judgment on the causes of his overthrow. I echo for Australia the statement made for the United States by the Senate Majority Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mansfield,</inline> that &#39;those among us who applaud his fall are mistaken&#39;. As to the consequences, so much is plain: A real national leader who refused to identify with either East or West now divides his exile between Peking and Moscow; a neutralist who, barely a month ago, warned against precipitate American withdrawal from the region is now the client of Peking; a head of state who was confident that the Red Khmers could be locally contained is now championed by the Red Khmers; and, above all, worst of all, the people of Cambodia are now to know war in a way that they have never known it for 17 years. Indeed, one would hardly expect the tragedy of this dimension to &#39;fit readily into the themes developed&#39; by the Minister. </para>
          <para>The Minister is content to justify and explain all events in this area - in Vietnam, in Laos, in Cambodia, in Thailand - by postulating North Vietnamese aggression. This, he says, in each case, is &#39;the fundamental cause&#39;. If we were to accept the Minister&#39;s explanation, plainly nothing could or should be done except stop North Vietnamese aggression - just as we are supposed to have stopped it in South Vietnam. The Minister puts forward the same fundamental cause&#39; in South Vietnam, in Laos, in Cambodia. Does he, then, put forward the same solution - the solution which he claims has been successful in Vietnam? Is this Canberra&#39;s message to Washington, to Vientiane, to Phnom Penh - that we should follow up our &#39;success&#39;God save the mark! - in Vietnam by similar successes&#39; in Laos and Cambodia? Even to justify himself, even to satisfy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> the Minister dares not go so far; but Laos and Cambodia may know - the Liberals declare it fearlessly to the world - that they have our &#39;sympathetic interest&#39;. The Liberal tradition continues - talk big; encourage the elements in any American administration which urge escalation; make it as difficult as possible for the United States to negotiate. </para>
          <para>Is it yet possible to propose a rational, attainable policy for this area? We on this side believe it is. We have put it again and again for 5 years. Its object is to neutralise Indo-China - that is, the countries of this area should not be subject to intervention, much less confrontation, on the part of the competing great powers. This is a much broader objective than the present declared policy of the United Slates - &#39;Vietnamisation&#39; of the war in Vietnam. &#39;Vietnamisation&#39; of the war is the method of American withdrawal from the war. But the important aim must be to &#39;Vietnamise&#39; the peace. The current events in Laos and Cambodia present the last opportunity we shall have for an international conference on IndoChina. This is an opportunity - not golden, not bright, but the last - which cannot be lost. Australia should be now proposing it. It is to international conferences, in 1954 and in 1962, that we owe whatever respite we were given in this area. It is true that we squandered the respite and abused the opportunity; it is equally true that the International Control Commission set up by those conferences has been rendered ineffective. But the precedent and the machinery exist for Indo-China in a way that they do nowhere else in the world. We should be urging it; we should be supporting France in her call for a global conference. Whatever may be thought of </para>
          <para class="block">France&#39;s actions and motives, one thing must be said: She has learnt the lessons of her grievous losses in Indo-China. </para>
          <para>There is nothing so depressing in the Minister&#39;s speech as his continuation of the fine old Liberal tradition of downgrading negotiations and rubbishing proposals from the other side. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies laid down the line that he would be the last Prime Minister to denounce negotiations. As it turned out, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> was. The Minister for External! Affairs mentions the &#39;proposals for a peaceful settlement&#39; - his words - in Laos put forward by the Pathet Lao on 6th March - and then proceeds to discount them. He discounts them on the ground that they are one-sided&#39;. If negotiations are never to proceed except on the basis that one side must put forward two-sided proposals, negotiations will never start - on this or any other matter. The Minister was Minister for Labour and National Service long enough to know that. One of the main reasons why  President  Johnson is no longer  President  of the United States is that he persistently refused to acknowledge that proposals for negotiations are not necessarily proposals for final settlement. It is argued that negotiations go on interminably, that the intransigence of the other side makes a mockery of them, that they are futile and sterile. But what can be said of negotiations that cannot be said about the war itself - with this difference, that negotiations do not destroy whole nations. </para>
          <para>The simple, blunt truth is that the Minister and his Government, and particularly its leaders, rubbish negotiations - whether they are &#39;one-sided&#39; proposals from the Pathet Lao or, to quote the Prime Minister, these things called peace talks in Paris&#39; - because of an attitude of mind which represents a hankering for vanished supremacies, a nostalgia of a distinctly racist cast. If, conceivably, a European area were involved in the kind of protracted and selfdestructive conflict that we now see in our area, that we have seen for a quarter century now, in Indo-China, this Government would urge and encourage every move in the United Nations to stop it, on any terms at all. If, conceivably, a European belligerent were to put forward proposals such as Hanoi&#39;s 4 points of 1966, or the Pathet Lao&#39;s proposals of 6th March, we would be touting every capital in the world to secure a peace conference on the basis of those proposals. We would not be looking too deeply into motives or consequences; we would be intent only on stopping the war or preventing its spread. 1 know that this attitude is not confined to supporters of the war; I know there are opponents of the war, and particularly of Australia&#39;s commitment to it, whose real objection is that we should be concerned in killing men or being killed by men of a different colour - because they are a different colour. But it is only in the present government that such people are part of, or have access to, the decision-making processes of this country. It is all very well for the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to give us 7 columns in Hansard under the heading &#39;Strategic Assessment&#39;, which was more geography than strategy. It is not just for geographical reasons that we have to play our part in Asia. Nor is it the reason which ran through the speech of the Minister for External Affairs like a dirge - to provide &#39;stability&#39;. This is not a role which this or any other democracy should set for itself - or believe itself capable of achieving. </para>
          <para>Australia&#39;s path to Asia is through doing the right and good thing. Our purpose and justification as a part of European civilisation in this Asian region is to show what it is to do the right and good thing according to the great Western ideas of reason, tolerance and progress and belief in human dignity and decency. Yet all to often Australia shows the obverse ugly side of European civilisation - its intolerance, its racialism, its desire to overawe and overwhelm those it chooses to regard as inferior. In short, all too often this nation does the wrong thing or, more frequently, we lose the credit for doing the right thing by doing it grudgingly and gracelessly - most notably in Vietnam, but in all those other matters which the Minister mentioned but chose not to discuss, namely, the problems of southern Africa, the South Pacific, such developments in disarmament as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and the proposal for better control of chemical and bacteriological warfare. </para>
          <para>Our attitude, more than our geography, will determine the role we are to play in this region. The Gorton Government&#39;s sympathetic attitude to southern Africa - or the regimes there - is doing Australia great damage in the world and in particular in our region. A fortnight after the Prime Minister was sworn in as a member of this place I drew his attention to a letter in the &#39;London Times&#39; in which the Agent-General for Victoria, a former Liberal Minister in that State, declared that South Africa and Rhodesia are in a similar position to Australia in that &#39;they are resisting the march of Communism in the Southern Hemisphere&#39;. I asked the Prime Minister whether he would repudiate this inept and offensive statement. He replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I believe it perfectly true to state that Australia, in fact, is resisting the encroachment of Communism in this part of the world and I have no apology to make for that part of the letter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">During the remainder of that year the honourable members for Chisholm <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)</inline> and Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> and the former member for Bowman had a free hand to synchronise questions and speeches in favour of Rhodesia. </para>
          <para>A year ago I drew the Prime Minister&#39;s attention to the visit to Australia on an Australian passport by Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins, who was formerly Commander of the Rhodesian Air Force and was to become Rhodesia&#39;s diplomatic representative to South Africa. I asked the Prime Minister whether he would make it plain that the Australian Government did not approve of an Australian citizen taking a position described as Rhodesia&#39;s diplomatic representative. In reply the Prime Minister contented himself with referring to the Air ViceMarshal&#39;s &#39;most distinguished career fighting for the free world against Fascism as a pilot with great distinction and finishing up as the head of the air force of a country which was then joined in opposing Hitler, Fascism and Fascist rule&#39;. Spurred by an interjection by the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen),</inline> he went on to praise Rhodesia as a country in which many of our pilots trained to fight against this aggressive Fascism. He concluded by asserting the rights of a man with &#39;a career which was distinguished and which had greatly helped the freedom of the world and the relief of Europe from conquest from abroad&#39;. Our Prime Minister&#39;s nostalgic affinity with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith,</inline> this yearning for the halcyon days of the junior officers&#39; mess, has infected the whole range of his Government&#39;s actions and our country&#39;s standing. </para>
          <para>It is little wonder that, after watching <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Smith&#39;s recent interview on &#39;Four Corners&#39;, the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner),</inline> the Liberal member with the longest parliamentary experience after the honourable member for Chisholm, pointed to the inescapable inference that in the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> the Australian Government sympathises with his regime and with its policies. Nor is it surprising that this same honourable member, fresh from his experiences in New York, has publicly and privately warned his colleagues that Australia will exert no beneficent influence in the United Nations until we clear up and clean up our attitudes on Rhodesia and New Guinea. The Australian Government is conspiring with the Rhodesian regime to facilitate the movements of its officials around the world. These officials can no longer receive British passports. Their Rhodesian passports are not recognised by any loyal member of the United Nations. The Australian Government has therefore obliged by giving alternative Australian passports to such of the Rhodesian officials as were born in Australia. The regime&#39;s Secretary of External Affairs - so named - was granted an Australian passport by the Australian Embassy in Pretoria in June 1967. The regime&#39;s diplomatic representative in Portugal received his Australian passport in December 1967. In August 1968, on instructions from Canberra, our Embassy in Pretoria gave Air ViceMarshal Hawkins his Australian passport. Last August I placed the following question on the notice paper for the Prime Minister: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Is it in accordance with the Government&#39;s policy for persons described as Rhodesia&#39;s diplomatic representatives in South Africa and Portugal to hold Australian passports. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I received no reply before the last Parliament was dissolved. I placed this question on the notice paper again 5 weeks ago. I have still received no reply. </para>
          <para>The Committee established in pursuance of the Security Council resolution of May 1968 has reported that, despite sanctions, Australia&#39;s exports to Southern Rhodesia have risen in each of the last 3 years and Australia has risen from ninth to second place among exporters to Southern Rhodesia. In the first year after the resolution, 88 persons were approved for entry from Rhodesia for visits and 107 for residence; in the following 9 months the figures rose to 105 and 127 respectively. It seems about half the entrants have travelled on Rhodesian passports. </para>
          <para>Thus in both trade and passports Australia is known to be defying United Nations resolutions of May 1968 and earlier and reaffirmed and reinforced as recently as 18th March by the Security Council. In answer to the honourable member for Chisholm, the former Minister for Immigration in effect apologised for having to follow United Nations resolutions on Rhodesian passports and said that there was certainly regret on his part in having to do so. </para>
          <para>In these circumstances should any of us be surprised that the honourable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McLeay)</inline> feels free to defame Australia, its people, its churches, its unions, on Rhodesian television? We may know how insignificant is his position as  chairman  of the Liberal Party&#39;s immigration committee. Other nations may place some emphasis on that position, not least the United States, where the Negro population is notably critical of the Australian Government. Our relations with the United States have always been to take account of the fact that it includes the world&#39;s most powerful black, community. The decision by the Secretary of State, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rogers,</inline> to close down the American consulate in Salisbury reflects the strength of feeling among America&#39;s 25 million negroes on this issue and on any issue involving the racist policies of South Africa and Rhodesia. </para>
          <para>Other nations, too, noting the preoccupation by the honourable member for Moreton with African governments and his evidence before the Rhodesian regime&#39;s Constitution Commission, will draw their own conclusions from the fact that he has now been appointed to the Australian Ministry, and a defence portfolio at that. In his first speech as Minister, the honourable gentleman could not forbear to obtrude a reference to the new member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen),</inline> who has dared to expose racist policies and attitudes by certain Australians in Australia towards Africa. Knowing how anxious the Prime Minister now is to ingratiate himself with the Democratic Labour Party, other nations place sig nificance on the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> to the National Press Club last October that the Government should examine the possibility of a naval arrangement with South Africa for defence in the Indian Ocean. </para>
          <para>The attitude of our Government towards the Territory of Papua and New Guinea will be judged in the world, and in our region, by the fact - among others - that a score of the Territory&#39;s police officers have previously served in African countries - more than half of them in Rhodesia - and that 49 other members of the Administration staff have previously been employed in African countries. The new Minister for External Affairs did not take long to disclose his own attitude towards southern Africa. He was reported as saying on 15th November at Kurri Kurri: </para>

            <para>I am a former Treasury expert and now a foreign relations expert. Between 20 minutes lo 5 yesterday and 10 minutes to 9 this morning 1 had to make 3 decisions. One was about foreign aid and one was about apartheid and I can&#39;t remember what the other one was. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He said he had made his decision according to the principle of non-interference in the affairs of other countries. </para>
          <para>Throughout the 1950s the Menzies Government opposed any United Nations resolutions condemning apartheid on the ground that this was a domestic issue which concerned South Africa alone. During the 1960s the Government came first to abstain from voting on such resolutions and finally to vote in favour of them. The issue came to a vote in the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on 14th November. Eighty-three members voted in favour of it and 20 abstained. Australia reverted to a vote against. The decision the Minister could not remember related to the Portuguese territories in Africa. It arose on the same day in the Fourth Committee. Eightyeight members voted in favour of it. This time Australia had the grace to abstain. </para>
          <para>The General Assembly carried 12 resolutions last November and December relating to trusteeship and non self-governing territories - Fourth Committee matters - on recorded votes or roll-calls. On all these controversial questions of colour and colonies Australia never voted against South Africa or Portugal. She consistently voted against all her neighbours in South East Asia and the Asian Commonwealth and the Indian Ocean. Australia voted in favour of 1 of the 12 resolutions - on New Guinea; she voted against 2- on Rhodesia and Oman; and abstained on the rest. New Zealand voted in favour of 4; Canada 5; Japan 8 and India 10. Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore and Thailand supported all the resolutions except that on Oman. Cambodia, Laos, Madagascar, Pakistan and the Philippines supported the whole 12 resolutions. </para>
          <para>The Minister for External Affairs avoided discussion of Australia&#39;s attitude to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the control of chemical and bacteriological warfare. He explicitly recognised that these matters are crucial in achieving a detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Government has never recognised its responsibilities in this regard. The Treaty is fundamental to the detente. Adhesion to it is the most important request on disarmament the United States had made to her friends and allies. The second point of the Guam Doctrine - America&#39;s nuclear guarantee to friends and allies - makes sense only in the context of the Treaty. The guarantee is feasible only if the Treaty works; Congress will endorse such a guarantee only to the extent that it is covered by the Treaty. Australia was the 97th of 98 nations which signed the Treaty before it entered into force. Indonesia was the 98th. New Zealand had signed it on the first day; she ratified it 7 months ago. Yet. in his 11th hour announcement that Australia would sign, the Prime Minister did his best to cast doubts on the validity of the guarantee. Is it any wonder that, with America&#39;s ANZUS partner baulking. other nations less closely associated were doubtful? To emphasise Australia&#39;s reluctance and scepticism, the Prime Minister gratuitously coupled his announcement that we would sign wilh an announcement that we would not yet ratify. So we are to go through the whole sorry process again - if it is left to him. Inevitably, we will ratify; but as far as this Government is concerned, it will be done in the same begrudging way as we came inevitably to sign - the day designed to ensure that Australia has the least influence and ihe least credit. The Gorton Government has an unerring ability to make a vice out of necessity. </para>
          <para>If Rhodesia and the Non-proliferation Treaty are examples of Australia&#39;s failure to co-operate with the United States in her best endeavours, our conduct at the United Nations on control of chemical and bacteriological warfare betrays equally shortsighted efforts to support the United States when most isolated and idiosyncratic. In the General Assembly, Australia, Portugal and the United States alone voted against the declaration that the Geneva Convention outlawed chemical and biological agents of warfare which poisoned or killed men, animals or plants. </para>
          <para>Our record on these 3 matters - Rhodesia, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and chemical and bacteriological warfare - has a common denominator. It has not been a question of consistent support for the United States, or concerted action with fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations. The one common factor is that we have been out of step with our neighbours; we have either lagged behind or been at outright loggerheads. At the United Nations at least, the Government consistently votes in favour of isolationism in our region. The Minister named the South Pacific as one of those matters on which debate is to be deferred. Fiji will become independent this year. Then the only British territory in the South Seas will be the Solomon Islands Protectorate. It is all the more urgent, therefore, that Australia make arrangements with the retiring British to facilitate postindependence arrangements between the Solomons and New Guinea. Such arrangements will mitigate the pressure for secession in Bougainville, which after all is the northernmost of the Solomons. </para>
          <para>The great significance of these matters is that Australia is directly and fully responsible for the specific decisions it makes upon them. They are all directly, some of them entirely, in our province. On none of them can we escape the consequences of the decisions we make, and the decisions we make are the things upon which we are judged by other nations. The Minister chose not to deal with these specific matters. He preferred the larger canvas. He preferred to base his statement not on those matters where Australia can or must make responsible decisions, but on Australian opinions on matters where the decision is not ours. Thus his statement dealt largely with Australian opinions rather than Australian decisions. He expressed his Government&#39;s opinion in 3 great matters of policy of 3 great nations; he expressed his Government&#39;s opinion as to action taken, policies enunciated, or likely developments in Britain, Japan and the United States. Yet even now, when we have had the benefit of the foreign affairs statement by the Minister for Defence, and the Minister for External Affairs&#39; postscript, it is not quite clear what the Government&#39;s attitude really is to each of these 3 matters. Still less is it certain that the Government has any realistic understanding of the policies of there 3 governments, or that its own policies are realistically related to the policies of these governments. We can only assume that the contradictions revealed by comparing the statements by the Ministers for Defence and External Affairs show that the Government as a whole is confused and uncertain. Of course, I reject with deserved contempt the Press speculation that these contradictions reflect personal rivalry between the immediate Ministers for Defence and External Affairs. Who could believe such a thing? Nevertheless, the contradictions remain. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Defence made it quite clear that in his belief the British policy of withdrawal from our region was irreversible. The tenor of his speech was so strong along this line that half the papers in Australia attributed the word &#39;irreversible&#39; to him in direct quotes, although the word itself is not contained in the actual speech. Perhaps that was the word the Minister used when giving his pre-speech briefing to the Press, when he was using the new Liberal technique of giving a ministerial statement a spurious significance by locking the Press up with it several hours before it is made in the Parliament. Ministers like the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> who went to sleep during the statement by the Minister for Defence might reflect on the sufferings of the pressmen who were physically imprisoned with it for 5 hours beforehand. Until the current Prime Minister got this bright idea, locking-up the Press used to be reserved for Budgets only, to prevent corrupt transactions. Perhaps the Minister for Defence felt he had to protect the shares of General Dynamics. However, the Minister for Defence plainly accepts the irreversibility of British disengagement. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s defence policy is presently based on such a position. Yet the Minister for External Affairs makes a last minute plea for a reversal of established British policy. In any meaningful sense, the thing is chimerical. Even should there be a change of government in Britain between now and 1976 - the election after next - there will be no significant British presence in this area after 1971. More particularly, there will be no troops - no land-based forces - in significant numbers after 1971. This is not merely a decision by a government of a particular party, nor, as the Minister for Defence seemed to imply, is it purely a decision of economic exigency. It is part of the inevitable trend, the policy that any European power - and Britain today is exclusively a European power - must follow. There is no more reason for Britain to have land forces in this area in the 1970s than for France, Germany, Italy or any other significant European power. In this regard, it is quite irrelevant which party is in power in Britain. So, in the first of the three significant factors which the Minister for External Affairs mentions, one thing stands out - Britain will not station, Britain will not maintain, garrisons of troops in this area in this decade. </para>
          <para>The second factor the Minister for External Affairs mentioned was Japan. Here again we find divergence between the Ministers for Defence and External Affairs. The Minister for Defence seems to be proposing some sort of interventionist military role for Japan. The Minister for External Affairs, to the credit of his Department, specifically rejects such a role, for his Department knows it is impossible. Of course, to speak, as the Minister did, of Okinawa redenta as an assumption of regional responsibilities by Japan is doubletalk. The very political elements in Japan most vocal on the return of Okinawa are those most opposed to any return to militarism in Japan. The blunt truth of the matter is this: There is not a country in Asia which would invite Japanese military intervention in its defence, and there is not a country in Asia to which Japan would be prepared to send troops. It is just not on. The Minister makes no recognition of the fact that, as trading nations, Australia and Japan have a common national interest - the preservation of the freedom of the high seas. Recently Australia had an opportunity to show the Japanese Government that this common interest can be important for our future relations. Nothing was done. Recently the Soviet announced major naval exercises around Japan which would severely disrupt Japan&#39;s trade and commerce. Such disruption would have affected Australia, not least because of the infringement of the principles outlined in the Convention on the High Seas. Australia failed to join Japan in its successful protests to the Soviet. </para>
          <para>Both Ministers correctly emphasise the importance of the role Japan can play in economic development in our region. They overlook what is perhaps her most significant role of all - in helping bridge relations between the United States and China. No <inline font-style="italic">country stands</inline> more to gain from rational relationships from China; no country is so well placed to make the beginning towards securing such relationships. It is regrettable that the Minister for External Affairs, while paying lip-service to the concept of restoring China to the international community, returned to the old doctrine that China must first give proofs of her fitness to be a member of that community. In this case again, one can draw a contrast between the doctrinaire approach of the Australian Government and the cautious pragmatism of the Nixon Doctrine as outlined in the President&#39;s address to Congress on 18th February.  President  Nixon makes no such prior conditions. If the standards of international conduct laid down by the Minister were the conditions of membership of the United Nations they would form as good an argument for expelling Russia as for excluding China. </para>
          <para>The problems of building a rational relationship with China are complex enough; it would resolve one difficulty if we were to drop at once the habit of directing sermons rather than proposals to China. The initial steps towards improved relations are about such matters as trade, travel and communications. As one of China&#39;s significant trading partners, Australia has certain opportunities. The pity of it is that up to 2 years ago we could have joined with Canada and Japan in helping the United States off the hook. But now, a comparison of the President&#39;s speech of 18th February and the speech of the Minister for External Affairs shows that in fact the United States has moved ahead of us; the official American position is now well in advance of ours. </para>
          <para>The third great factor which, according to the Minister, hasmajor implications for our region&#39; is Nixon Doctrine itself. The new and crucial part of this Doctrine is Statesclause 3, which states:   the United States will look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> manpower for its defence. </para>
          <para class="block">Fundamentally, this is the President&#39;s response to the demand of the people and the Congress of the United States that there shall be no more Vietnams. It is perhaps not so much a new doctrine as a return to orthodoxy after the Vietnam aberration - namely, the orthodoxy that American arms should not be involved on the mainland of Asia. </para>
          <para>I agree with the Minister that the 3 factors he mentions - British withdrawal, the role of Japan and the Nixon doctrine - are 3 of the most significant factors in determining Australian foreign and defence policies. But he seems to avoid the cumulative impact of the 3 factors. For there is one thing that each of these 3 - the 3 policies of very diverse nations - have in common: They each drive at the same point. They all define for themselves a role in Asia; but each of them excludes the provision of ground troops as part of her role. None of them will in future provide manpower. Not only do these 3 powers reach a common conclusion; they work on a common assumption. It is not just because of economic difficulties that Britain is no longer prepared to provide troops for Asia; it is not just for historical reasons that Japan cannot; it is not just for domestic political reasons that the United States will not. Beyond these reasons, each powerful enough in itself, is the greater reason - the futility of foreign troops in national Wars. These 3 great powers - 3 of the 4 nations, with Indonesia, with which Australia is most concerned - each abdicate voluntarily from the role of providing troops for the defence of foreign countries. Australia alone still proposes such a role for herself, in the face of experience, in the face of the future. Yet of all these countries, we are the weakest in manpower. We have not a fifth of the manpower of the smallest of these powers. We are a small, exceedingly wealthy nation neighboured by the most populous and some of the poorest nations in the world. And yet, in such a situation, the linch-pin of our defence policy is a battalion - 1,000 men - in Singapore. We are asked to believe that this is a meaningful ind modern contribution to the needs of this region, at the very time that the greatest of the democracies are turning their backs irreversibly on such methods. </para>
          <para>The garrisoning of a single battalion in Singapore is an irrelevancy to genuine regional co-operation. Indeed, it may be a barrier to that objective. Regional cooperation which ignores &#39;Indonesia is. a contradiction in terms. It would be idle to pretend that our relations with Malaysia have improved as a result of the decision to withdraw our forces from Terendak and instal them in Singapore. On the terms which our own Government lays down as the role of our troops, logic would have required that, if they were to be stationed anywhere, they should be in Malaysia. Under these terms, there could be only one conceivable role - helping to prevent border incursions in northern Malaysia. If there is any other role envisaged, the House would like to hear it. Such an involvement would require closer collaboration with Malaysian forces and a considerable degree of command integration. Plainly the decision to withdraw from Malaysia precludes such collaboration and integration. I believe it was deliberately intended to achieve that result; but once that crucial decision was made, the facesaving compromise was made between the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Defence that they should go only as far as Singapore. The logistic problems involved in such an operation have never been re vealed to this House; the Minister for Defence avoided mentioning them. As a result of this compromise - a political compromise and nothing else - we have a decision which is militarily wrong, logistically wrong and historically wrong. We have a battalion in search of a role; indeed it seems we have a battalion in search of a roof. </para>
          <para>It cannot be said too often that the basts of regional co-operation in our neighbourhood is Indonesia; it cannot be said too often that defence arrangements which exclude or bypass Indonesia are completely unbalanced. I can think of no significant country in the world which plans its foreign and defence policies with so little reference to its nearest and greatest neighbour as Australia does in relation to Indonesia. </para>
          <para>Both the Ministers for External Affairs and Defence express their abhorrence of what they call isolationism. I can only assume their anonymous auditor was intended to be the Prime Minister - this House&#39;s leading isolationist. Isolationism is as much a matter of attitude of mind as of the disposition of forces. We do not automatically become regionally minded by isolating one of our battalions in Singapore. The true antithesis of isolationism is not regional co-operation and regional involvement but interventionism. Australia should stand for regional co-operation and involvement; it should reject both isolationism and interventionism. Regional involvement requires not only military co-operation but, most importantly, social and economic cooperation. It requires above all an attitude which recognises and sympathises with national aspirations and national expectations. The real objection to isolationism is not military but moral; not just what might happen in other countries, not what other countries may do to us, but what we may do to ourselves. The archetype of isolationism in our hemisphere is South Africa. The true isolationists in this country are those who would create a similar image for Australia, those who contemplate an association of Ishmaelites in the name of anti-Communism. That is the path toward real isolation in our region, from the peoples of our region. The Government&#39;s voting record in the United Nations shows just how far this truly isolationist spirit infects our present rulers. </para>
          <para>Equally, interventionism is a morally and socially destructive doctrine. The recognition of this is at the root of the present reappraisal, and what will prove to be a reversal, of American policies. The war in Vietnam spells the end of interventionism not merely because it has been militarily disastrous but because it has been socially disastrous, lt has been the most divisive and disruptive war in America&#39;s history: lt has been the most divisive and disruptive war in Australia&#39;s history. President Nixon&#39;s problem is not to &#39;save&#39; Vietnam, or &#39;save&#39; Laos, but to save the fabric of American society. No democratic society can long survive half-alienated, and in the United States alienation is deepest among the very groups upon whose co-operation and dedication democratic society most depends - the young, the educated and the idealistic. No enemy has inflicted a greater defeat upon the United States Army than it received from within at My Lai. No conscription can make up the loss of 60,000 young Americans who cross into Canada each year to avoid Vietnam. Yet these Australian Liberals - these little frightened men who proclaim their proprietorial interest in the American alliance - are prepared to see this war go on and on, have twice sabotaged American initiatives to end it, have resented or resisted any moves to stop it, whatever the cost to America&#39;s real strength and purpose in the world. </para>
          <para>And for what reasons is this blood-bath in Vietnam, and this disintegration in the United States, to continue? In February the Minister for Defence, speaking in Perth to an assemblage of Young Liberals - estimable enough young people who get far more frankness from Ministers than this Parliament ever does - said that the trouble was that the people of Australia did not understand the Government&#39;s attitude. It is 5 years next month since the first battalion was sent to Vietnam. Three Prime Ministers have presided over the subsequent escalation. Three national elections - two general elections and a Senate election - have been fought with Vietnam as a central issue. Nearly 400 Australian troops have been killed. Every significant Australian newspaper, at one time or another, has supported the war, and most still do in one way or another. Yet the Minister for Defence believes that majority opposition to continued commitment is simply a ques tion of better public relations. The same Minister, speaking in Saigon last week, stated that the reduction of the Australian commitment was solely dependent on decisions by the United States: that is, on behalf of the Government of Australia, a Minister states publicly that it is of no importance whatever Australians think, that it is not for them to propose, dispose or oppose. In the same week, the Prime Minister described demonstrations against the war as &#39;anarchy&#39;, as &#39;storm-trooper tactics&#39;. The truth is that these demonstrations are designed to assert Australia&#39;s moral responsibility for actions committed in the name of Australia, when her government has abdicated its own responsibilities. </para>
          <para>It was left to the Prime Minister of Australia to be the first to describe dissenters against Vietnam as Communist-inspired. In 5 years of dissent this charge has never been made, and particularly not in the United States, where the list would include half the Congress, including the Senate Majority Leader, two brothers of a former  President  and a candidate for the vicepresidency of the United States. But this charge, flung out so irresponsibly by the Prime Minister, has its own intrinsic significance in relation to the foreign affairs debate that goes on in this Parliament a;id this nation. It betrays a central fact of Liberal foreign policy-making. The foreign affairs decisions, even the commitment of troops, have depended on internal political considerations of the most cynical kind Fundamentally, the Liberal appeal is to fear, and one of its ingredients is racial fear. We will have to root this out, out of our government, out of our national character. This nation&#39;s proper part in  Dur  region, as a good neighbour, a good helper and as an example of the good and open society, cannot be built on the basis of fear or hate. To try to do so is to inflict on ourselves, on our system, on our civilisation, a far deeper wound than any foreign enemy is ever likely to do. </para>

I have seldom heard the Leader of the Opposition so caustic as he was against our great ally the United States of America. All of us know that the Americans have their faults but do we not have faults ourselves? At least, when it comes to our corner of the world it is the United States which is carrying the free world on its back; but the United States is getting mighty little thanks from people like the Leader of the Opposition for doing so. Perhaps he is getting ready for the Vietnam Moratorium. I understand that one of the 13 members who had not signed the document giving support to the Vietnam moratorium was written to and asked why he had not signed it. At least he had the courage of his convictions to say that he believed it would be disastrous for Australian troops to be immediately withdrawn from Vietnam. </para>

              <para>- No, he will not last long. What will happen to him? Why would the Opposition not support this Vietnam moratorium? Its policy on Vietnam is identical with the pol&#39;icy of those who are organising the moratorium. They believe that all Australian troops and in fact all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Vietnam. When they refer to foreign troops they do not for a moment mean the North Vietnamese; they mean those who are fighting the North Vietnamese. They believe that Australian troops and American troops should be withdrawn. The Labor Party believes in this and so do the Vietnam moratorium organisers. Everyone in Australia realises that the moratorium is being supported financially by the Communist Party through its front movement, the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament. </para>

          <para>We were told by the Leader of the Opposition that the intervention by the United States in Vietnam had been a Vietnam aberration. But what would happen if the Americans were to withdraw. It is terribly easy to make these cutting and caustic remarks when you have no responsiblity. What would happen if the United States and Australia immediately withdrew, as has been advocated both by the previous Leader of the Opposition in his policy speech of 1966 and by the present Leader of the Opposition in 1969? There would be chaos. I am sure that no-one would think for a moment that all troops supporting Vietnam - I was going to say all the foreign troops - could be withdrawn without chaos. A recent visitor to this country was a very great Englishman, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Thompson, who is a great expert of counterinsurgency, having assisted enormously the British in Malaysia-Singapore and now assisting the Americans in Vietnam. In a book he wrote recently he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The consequences of a defeat need to be carefully weighed. In South Vietnam itself a people would go under. Judging from past experience in China and North Vietnam perhaps several hundred thousands, who have supported the war and fought valiantly and who would certainly oppose the conqueror&#39;s subsequent collectivisation programme, might be slaughtered. This will not be shown on television and so may not worry subverted liberals and fellow travellers, but others may have it on their conscience. There is after all no Formosa to which the victims can escape, nor has any area been set aside for them in the C&#39;alifornian desert. In a year or two they will be conveniently forgotten and the consequent stagflation of the economy is advanced as a specious argument for international aid. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are advocating this and will do this if they have their way but, thank goodness, we know they will not have their way. Even though the Americans are de-escalating the war at the present moment we know that they realise and we realise that it is necessary and will be necessary for support to be given to the South Vietnamese for some time to come. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition talked about the 3 elections that had been held since the Vietnam war commenced, but he did not make the point that one of those 3 elections in which the Vietnamese policy was the vital issue, the 1966 election, saw this Government returned with the greatest strength that any Government has had during the 70 years history of federation in this country. Surely that shows - and thank goodness it does - that the ideas of the Leader of the Opposition and the ideas of the Australian people are poles apart. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition believes that we should have rushed in and signed the Treaty for the Non-Pro! iteration of </para>
          <para class="block">Nuclear Weapons. He can always find someone to quote, and in this instance he quoted New Zealand as an example. I suppose he says that Australia should automatically have done what New Zealand did. We have signed the Treaty, but with certain reservations. It is only right that we should not blindly charge in and sign something just because the Leader of the Opposition thinks that by doing so we might encourage someone else to sign it. We would all welcome a really watertight treaty, but we want to find out whether it will prevent proliferation. Personally  1  have great reservations in my own mind as to whether it will prevent proliferation. I have heard a very eminent scientist recommend that if a country wanted eventually to become a nuclear power the first thing it should do is to sign and to ratify the Treaty. It will then have access to all the information it requires. It will be able, under inspection, to build up supplies of plutonium, and if and when it desires to become a nuclear power all it has to do is pull out of the Treaty and within a matter of months it can become a nuclear power. </para>
          <para>Before we go ahead and ratify the Treaty we want to be sure that it is watertight and that it will reduce proliferation. I would like to give to the House some of the conditions the Commonwealth Government would like to see fulfilled before it will ratify the Treaty. The Australian Government hopes that the Treaty will be effective in its operation and will lead to improved relations and enhanced co-operation between the nations of the world. It believes that a condition of an effective treaty is that it should attract a necessary degree of support. Some progress in this direction has been made but the Government will nevertheless want to be assured that there is a sufficient degree of support for the Treaty. </para>
          <para>It is of interest to note that the support which has brought the Treaty into operation has come from those countries which have no possibility or feasibility in the near future, or even in the fairly distant future, of becoming a nuclear power. We want to know what is to happen to the greater powers. For example, we know quite well that neither France nor China will sign. They are both nuclear powers but they will not sign or ratify the Treaty. We know that India will not ratify it. West Germany and Japan have recently signed but like Australia have very strong reservations about ratifying it. They want to see that something is done to satisfy the reservations they have about the Treaty. South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan and Thailand have not ratified it. Thailand has not even signed. Indonesia has not ratified, neither has Israel, Italy, any of the Euratom countries, or Spain or even for that matter Byelorussia or the Ukraine. Surely before we press ahead with committing ourselves - and we could commit ourselves irrevocably on this matter - we ought to determine what support the Treaty will get, and whether it will reduce proliferation or whether it will be like the nuclear test ban, during the operation of which we discovered that 2 new countries had become nuclear powers. The Australian Government went on to say in paragraph 7 of a paper issued by the Department of External Affairs: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Notes that Article 10 of the Treaty provides that any party has the right to withdraw in circumstances that jeopardised its supreme interest. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What does this &#39;jeopardy of supreme interest&#39; mean? If a country can say its supreme interest is jeopardised and so easily get out of the Treaty, what on earth is the use of the Treaty? If it is hard to get out you bind yourself for all time. No one can foresee what the future holds for us. So these are reasons - and there are others - why  1  believe the Commonwealth Government was very wise indeed to take its time before it decided to sign and, when it did decide to sign, to put in these reservations. </para>
          <para>Unlike the Leader of the Opposition I believe that the Government deserves to be congratulated on the recent statements that it has made on foreign affairs. They go a long way towards meeting the criticisms that have been made of the inadequacy of the Government&#39;s recent approach to foreign policy. They signify a very necessary adaptation to the changing circumstances of Australia&#39;s international environment. I mentioned the Government&#39;s recent statement on foreign affairs. While tonight we are debating the statement of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> we need also to take into account the recent statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> In outlining his strategic thinking behind the new approach to the defence of Australia he covered much of the ground also covered by the Minister for External Affairs. Here I would like to issue a word of warning to the Government. As I see it, the strategic assessment of the international situation is primarily a matter for the Minister for External Affairs and his Department. After the strategic assessment has been made and accepted, perhaps with some variations by the Government, it is then for the Minister for Defence to determine, in the light of that appreciation, what should then be our defence forces and equipment. On this occasion, apart from some minor variations, the two Ministers have been singing the same tune. But I can foresee problems and misunderstandings ahead for the Government if both these Ministers feel themselves free to put forward their separate views on external&#39; affairs, unless there is the closest collaboration between them. </para>
          <para>To return to the statement of the Minister for External Affairs, this is a new policy; let there be no mistake about that. The main difference from the old foreign policy is that the main emphasis is no longer on supporting the traditional great and powerful allies and upholding military alliances. The main emphasis is on Australia looking after its own interests and protecting itself as a significant power in the South East Asia region. An active and more independent role for Australia is seen as the best way in which Australia can advance its security in the changed circumstances of the 1970s. None of this is to say that Australia should lightly do anything which might in any way weaken its relations with our traditional great allies in the United States and Britain. On the contrary, every effort should be made to preserve and even strengthen relations with these countries. But, as realists, we must recognise that our traditional allies will not loom as large as they did in our part of the world. It is therefore sheer prudence to base our foreign policy on a greater measure of self reliance than in the past. The new foreign policy of the United States - as outlined by  President  Nixon in his report to Congress on 18th February - must have had a great impact on the formulation of the Government&#39;s new foreign policy.  President  Nixon&#39;s report has obvious significance for Australia. The first point is that, in this 40,000-word review of the whole range of American foreign policy and defence commitments, Australia and the ANZUS Treaty do not get any mention at all. It would be wrong to conclude that the Nixon Administration has written Australia off and that Australia ranks as quite insignificant in American calculations. But, at the same time, it may be an indication that Australia does not loom as large in the thinking of the American administration as Australians may have been led to believe by the emotional attachment of  President  Johnson. </para>
          <para>President Nixon, in his statement of the new American foreign policy, states in one place that the United States will not be involved in the world because of its commitments. &#39;Our interests must shape our commitments, rather than the other way around&#39;, he said. He went on to say: &#39;The fostering of self reliance is the new purpose and direction of American involvement in Asia&#39;. In other words, America, which in Asia has been carrying the free world on its back, is getting a little tired of doing so, and is looking round to see what contributions the other democracies are making or are prepared to make in this area. </para>
          <para>The other three largest democracies who have or have had interests in South East Asia are Japan, Great Britain and France. I was very pleased to see therefore that the Minister for External Affairs devoted a major part of his speech to the growth of Japan and the even greater growth which is likely in its influence in the region and beyond. Japan is almost completely lacking in fuel and natural resources for its vast industries. We know this to our profit as a major supplier of many raw material&#39;s to Japan. Any interruption to the flow of these supplies, which consist of oil from the Middle East and Indonesia, rubber from Malaysia, and metal ores, wool, coal and wood chips from Australia, would be quite crippling to the Japanese economy and intolerable to the Japanese Government. That fact alone is likely to impel! the Japanese Government to increase radically its self defence forces. The extreme pacifism of the Japanese people following the disasters they were led into by the militarists in World War II is quickly waning, and the Japanese people are increasingly sensing the need for military forces for defence, like other peaceable countries. They are raising the proportion of their gross national production spent on defence above the present low level of 1%. They plan to treble the amount of money spent on defence in the next 5-year programme compared to the 5 year defence programme they have just completed. I welcome this move, even bearing in mind the history of Japanese aggression in the Second World War. </para>
          <para>I mentioned that the other two major democracies who have or have had interests in South East Asia are Great Britain and France. The Minister, quite rightly, said that it would be a major misfortune if, at this time, the benign British influence east of Suez was diminished, when the region is faced with such new and complex problems. He said that we therefore strongly hope that the British withdrawal may be delayed. He has been called naive and unreal in expressing the desire that Britain retain an influence east of Suez. It is true that, at the present moment, the only hope of reversing the current trend of British withdrawal from Malaysia appears to be a Conservative win in the approaching elections. Some British even ask: Why should we waste money stationing troops thousands of miles from Britain when our vital interests are not immediately in jeopardy?&#39; One could have said the same thing during two world wars when Australia&#39;s vital interests were not immediately threatened but when hundreds of thousands of Australians flocked to the aid of Britain and France and a great many of them now lie buried far from their native shore. For our size, we probably made a greater contribution than any other nation to the success of the allies. Yet, only in the latter part of the Second World War were our own vital interests at stake. Again, in both the Malaysian emergency and the confrontation in Borneo - countries from which Britain has in the past drawn great wealth - Australian aid was readily forthcoming. One would have expected therefore some sympathy and understanding from the two great industrial nations of Britain and France for us in our dilemma in Vietnam. What have we received? </para>
          <para>The French are making a small contribution towards the civilian expenditure of the Vietnamese Government on schools and hospitals, but otherwise one gets the impres sion that they would hate to see anyone succeed in Vietnam where they failed. British ships continue to carry goods into North Vietnam, though they expect our help in their so far unsuccessful confrontation with Rhodesia. It may be said that the reason for the failure of France and Great Britain to make any contribution in Vietnam is their opposition to the war. But have they or any of the many others throughout the world who are opposed to the Vietnam war ever thought out to the end the possible alternatives? There appear to me to be only two alternatives - either North Vietnam is going to get South Vietnam, or it is not. lt is the second alternative that we and the United States are backing. We believe that the future of South Vietnam must be determined by the people themselves, and that North Vietnam should be prevented from determining that future by force. </para>
          <para>Thus, the alternatives in South Vietnam would appear to be a free nation, gaining in strength and prosperity, governing itself via the ballot box but still needing for some time some assistance against external aggression, or else a sort of Communist Yugoslavia preceded, of course, by a bloodbath. I do not think many people would desire to see the latter, although having read the book on Vietnam by the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns),</inline> 1 am not so sure that he does not want to see this solution. </para>
          <para>In his book &#39;No exit from Vietnam&#39;, from which I have already quoted, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Thompson goes on to say that if America does not stand firm in Vietnam &#39;every other American commitment will be exposed to doubt and anxiety on the part of those in whose favour it was made&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> concluded: </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Tonight I want to examine what the Government has described as its new and comprehensive commitment to regional security. When we unwrap this pretentious parcel of platitudes what do we find? Firstly, the Government is not talking about the whole Asian region; it is not talking about stationing our forces in Indonesia, India, Burma or Ceylon, because those countries do not want our forces; it is not talking about joining an Asian regional defence organisation, because there is not one, and if there was Australia would not be invited to join. In essence, the Government is talking not about Asia, not even about South East Asia, but 2 countries - Malaysia and Singapore. Secondly, the Government is talking about only 1,200 troops stationed in only one of these countries - Singapore. Thirdly, the Government, in a grand but empty gesture, is leaving 2 squadrons of Mirages in Malaysia because it has no alternative. It has failed to provide a base in Australia capable of taking half of our own fighter forces - that half at present in Malaysia. Fourthly, the Government is contributing only one naval vessel to the Malaysia-Singapore arrangements, which represents a halving of our previous commitment. This is what the Government represents as Australia&#39;s role in regional security. It is a fraud. What passes as the Government&#39;s policy is insignificant in relation to the only 2 countries affected and of no consequence or even interest to all the other countries in the region. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government&#39;s handling of even these limited commitments has been unbelievably incompetent. Firstly, we have abandoned an Army base in Malaysia which has cost the Australian taxpayer millions of dollars and the Government has not thought fit to tell the Australian taxpayer what is to happen to our multi-million dollar investment in that base. Secondly, because of the absence of any agreement or even intelligent negotiation, our troops have been dumped into 2 run-down barracks in Singapore whichare 12 miles apart. Our troops are already in Singapore, yet the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has told us that discussions with Singapore about the final location of the troops are continuing. Thirdly, although Australia ran the base at Butterworth the lease was held by the British, who have relinquished the base to the Malaysians. The investment of millions of dollars of Australian taxpayers&#39; money was not protected. The Government has again goofed badly. Fourthly, if we are to believe this Government&#39;s repeated statements that we are so welcome why can we not get the Army base we want in Singapore and why are the Malaysians demanding a stiff rental or indeed a rental at all for the air base at Butterworth? The simple answer is that the Governments in Malaysia and Singapore have shown demonstrably by their actions that they could not care less whether we stayed or left. </para>
          <para>Let us examine what this Government claims are the terms of our continuing presence in Malaysia and Singapore. In February 1969 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Our forces will be stationed in the area under existing arrangements, the terms of which are governed by our association with the AngloMalaysia Defence Agreement. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us be very clear that Australia is not a signatory to that Agreement. Through an exchange of letters our association was expressly in terms of our participation in the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. The Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia no longer exists. In short, there are no existing arrangements covering the presence of the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth. Let it also be clearly understood that Singapore is not a signatory to the AngloMalaysia Defence Agreement. There are no existing arrangements covering the Australian Army presence in Singapore. The Australian people are being monstrously deceived. It is a mark of the superficiality of this Government&#39;s approach to foreign affairs that it equates isolationism with the withdrawal of a handful of forces from 2 countries. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party is opposed to the 19th century garrison mentality that typifies the present Government&#39;s approach to foreign affairs and defence. President Nixon, commenting on his own policy of not committing land forces abroad, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The only issue before us is how we can be most effective in meeting our responsibilties, protecting our interests and thereby building peace. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Labor Party does not accept, as President Nixon no longer accepts, that the garrisoning of forces in foreign countries is an effective way of meeting our responsibilities. It is this -clinging to the remnants of colonial attitudes that has isolated the Liberal Party from the mainstream of Asia. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government is now mourning the demise of another myth that it has wilfully and deceitfully supported - the myth of SEATO. Whilst several pages of  President  Nixon&#39;s February statement on foreign policy are devoted to NATO there is not a single line about or a single reference to SEATO. This was pointed out by the honourable member for Farrer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn).</inline> SEATO has been submerged by its own irrelevance. And this is the organisation that successive Liberal Party leaders have described as a cornerstone of our foreign and defence policies. Fourteen years ago I was associated with SEATO in Bangkok and was  chairman  of one of its subcommittees. Even then the staff of SEATO referred to the organisation by its initials as the &#39;Sitting Eating And Talking Organisation&#39;. From its artificial inception SEATO failed miserably to attract the major countries of Asia, whose interests SEATO was supposed to protect. Our nearest neighbours - Indonesia. Malaysia and Singapore - have never thought that SEATO was worth while joining. The largest nonCommunist country in the world - India - declined entreaties to join, as did Burma and <inline font-style="italic">Ceylon.</inline> Pakistan joined because it believed that the organisation could be an effective lever not against Communist China but against its neighbour India. France, Britain and Pakistan have long since ceased to participate in the charade and even the Thai Foreign Minister has described the military capability of SEATO as a fiction. It is even more so now that President Nixon has excluded ground forces from its commitments. </para>
          <para>The United States and Australian Governments have sought to make public relations mileage out of associating SEATO with the intervention in Vietnam. Three foundation members of SEATO - Britain, France and Pakistan - are noteworthy by their absence from Vietnam. The only reason why the two remaining Asian members - Thailand and the Philippines - intervened was that the United States blatantly bribed them to send units. As the  Chairman  of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee said recently: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This seems to me to be the ultimate in corruption for us to make deals like this in pursuit of an illusory policy all designed to prove to the world that we have great support in Vietnam which we do not have at all . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In common with Thailand and the Philippines, Australia is not in Vietnam because of a SEATO decision. Nor are we there - let us be very clear about this - because of a request from the South Vietnamese Government. In each case the much publicised but significantly unpublished request from the South Vietnamese Government came, if it came at all, as a contrived and diplomatically convenient afterthought to the pressure exerted by the United States administration. Such are the myths and deceptions on which the Liberal Party has thrived. </para>
          <para>We have heard in this session the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> parrot another myth - the domino theory. The honourable member for Farrer was to continue this myth. The domino theory requires for its validity the assumption that any dissent from the established order, no matter how corrupt, no matter how incompetent, no matter how dictatorial that establishment may be, is defined as Communist. Even in Australia the Liberal Party readily equates dissent with treason. It boasts of its membership of the free world, which comprehends a multitude of totalitarian and oppressive regimes, all assumed to be respectable as long as they are not Communist. But how different the theory appears if we accept, as  President  Nixon is now coming to accept and the Labor Party has always accepted, the rightful place of nationalism and demands for social and economic justice.  President  Nixon now recognises the explosion of another myth - international Communist unity. To use his own words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Once a unified bloc, its solidarity has been broken by the powerful forces of nationalism  . . The Marxist dream of international Communist <inline font-style="italic">unity</inline> has disintegrated. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The domino theory may be applicable to the game of dominoes, but we are not playing with dominoes. We are dealing with people and countries with long traditions and intense national pride. lt is now coming to be recognised in the United States that the United States policies, which this Government has slavishly and mindlesssly followed, have strengthened the Communists&#39; position. In supporting corrupt, incompetent and unrepresentative regimes we have played into the hands of the Communists. We have given responsible opposition groups only one outlet - to join forces with and, on many occasions, be exploited by the Communists. And we have forced nationally minded Communists into dependence on foreign Communist powers. No Vietnamese Communist, no matter how indoctrinated with Communist ideology, would have sought material support from China, a country which for centuries the Vietnamese have regarded as hostile. I would remind honourable members that to this day there are still no Communist Chinese combat forces in Vietnam. Yet our involvement in Vietnam forced the Vietnamese nationalists and Communists into a far closer relationship with Communist China than would have been their preference. Through our lamentable ignorance of Asia we succeeded in achieving what our policy should have been designed to avoid. </para>
          <para>The Minister for External Affairs has parroted the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Thompson that the domino theory is valid because he has talked to the dominoes. Let us listen to the talk of one of the so-called dominoes, Indonesia, given by that country&#39;s Ambassador to the United States, Soedjatmoko. In an address in Hawaii he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is not the political colour of a regime that counts in the end, but its capacity for nationbuilding and development. In the present world situation no outside power can for long force any South East Asian country to do its bidding. The South East Asian nations do not constitute lifeless entities that automatically fall one way or the other. The domino theory, therefore, is to us rather a gross over-simplification of the nature of the historical processes that go on in the area. It obscures and distorts rather than illuminates our understanding and offers no guidelines for realistic policy.  &#93; had the privilege of representing Australia, or of being a representative of Australia, for extended periods in 2 of the so called dominos - Malaysia and Thailand. My experience coincides with that of Soedjatmoko. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Just before 1 left Malaysia 1 paid a farewell call to Sarawak and went to a place called Engkilili. A longhouse in Engkilili had been burned down some 2 months prior to my visit. 1 had gone down with the resident for the particular division and on the way down he said that he was carrying a cheque for M20.000- about SA6.000- -to go to the longhouse dwellers. I said: &#39;They will be glad to see you.&#39; He said: T am not so sure about that.&#39; When wc got there the longhouse dwellers sent him packing with his SM 20,000 cheque. On carrying out investigations 1 found out that the day after the longhouse burned down the Sarawak Communist organisation had turned up with 5 bags of rice, some galvanised iron and a small work force to help put up new accommodation. </para>
          <para>When I got back to Kuching I spoke with a leading member of the Sarawak Government - I will be happy to give his name to the Minister for External Affairs - and said: &#39;You seem to have trouble in Engkilili. What is it?&#39; He said: The trouble is that the Sarawak Communist organisation is too close to the people.&#39; I said: &#39;What are you going to do about it?&#39; He said: &#39;We need more guns.&#39; This attitude is regrettably all too prevalent. It assumes that the only good Communist is a dead one. But I am sure that the reverend gentleman among the honourable members opposite will be well aware of the great strength that Christianity derived from its martyrs. I would suggest that the only good Communist is one who is politically helpless - who has, by enlightened policies, been deprived of any popular cause to exploit. That is the direction in which our foreign policy should lie, and we do not get there by bolstering incompetent, corrupt and unrepresentative regimes. </para>
          <para>It has always disturbed me that we have been ever ready to credit the Communist Chinese with masterminding everything from minor riots to major coups. We have been Mao Tse-tung&#39;s best public relations agent. We have built for the Communist Chinese a reputation which their own ineptitude in diplomatic affairs and their nonexistent conventional strike capacity could never hope to do. This Government goes into the 1970s as it emerged from the 1960s without a foreign policy and without a defence policy. For too long we have marched to the beat of another drum. Our political interests in South East Asia and our economic interests at home have been electioneered on the one hand and auctioneered on the other. In the eyes of the world the lucky country is fast becoming the lackey country. For too long the Liberal Party has adhered like glue to old myths, echoed tired slogans and adamantly avoided facing up to new realities. What this country needs, and needs urgently, is a thoroughgoing reappraisal of inherited assumptions. We need an Australian foreign policy and on past performance and present indications we need, above all, a new government. </para>

              <para>Legal aid in (he Territory of Papua and New Guinea is supplied mainly by the Public Solicitor. The Public Solicitor provides legal aid before all courts of the Territory, both in civil and criminal cases, to &#39;impecunious&#39; persons, whether indigenous or expatriate. &#39;Impecunious&#39; is considered subjectively and in relation to the circumstances of each individual case, having regard to the probable cost of alternative means of representation and the means, if any, of the applicant. Where the applicant has sufficient means to make more than a trivial contribution towards the cost involved, it is the duty of the Public Solicitor to assess a reasonable charge for his services having regard to the capacity of his client to pay, the necessity for representation and the hardship the client might suffer if he were compelled to obtain representation other than by the Public Solicitor. Applications to the Public Solicitor for legal aid to defend criminal charges before the Supreme Court are subject only to this means test. However, where an application is made for representation in the lower courts the Public Solicitor also has regard to: </para>

Broadly, all applications by impecunious persons in matters relating to the restoration of land titles, workers&#39; compensation, or to claims by relatives arising from death are granted. Other applications requiring action in the Supreme Court are granted if there appears to be a good cause of action and counsel are available.

            <para>The provision of financial assistance and relief for those affected by natural disasters such as Cyclone Ada is primarily the responsibility of State Governments. However, the Commonwealth normally contributes; on a dollar for dollar basis, towards the costs incurred by State Governments in providing relief of personal hardship and distress resulting frsm such disasters. In a telegram dated 19 January 1970, the Prime Minister offered Commonwealth assistance to the Queensland Government, on a dollar for dollar basis, for the relief of personal hardship and distress in the areas affected by Cyclone Ada. </para>
            <para>In circumstances similar to this disaster, it has been the practice for State authorities to recompense private citizens for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in relief and rescue operations. I understand that small boat owners who took part in search and rescue operations during Cyclone Ada have already been recompensed by State authorities for fuel used in these operations. The costs so incurred by the State will be included as part of the total cost of providing relief of personal hardship and distress which, as I have indicated, will be shared equally by the State Government and the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>The Government&#39;s policy is to encourage increasing participation by Papuans and New Guineans in the ownership and managementof enterprises. Nevertheless, it is recognised that overseas capital is necessary to establish secondary industry in a developing country and it is to be expected that the bulk of such investment in the Territory should come from Australians with consequent Australian ownership. As mentioned in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech it is proposed to ask the Territory House of Assembly for legislation to establish a statutory corporation to acquire equity in major investment projects in the Territory. One of the principal functions of this new institution will be to take up shares in appropriate enterprises and hold them for future disposal to the people of the Territory. </para>

            <para>It is a general principle of our income tax law to tax Australian residents on their world income, except where relief is granted from double taxation, on the ground that they receive governmentprovided benefits and that it is equitable for Australians with comparable incomes to pay comparable tax.T his general principle is modified, where, to give effect to International Agreements to which Australia is a signatory, the salaries of Australian residents who are officials of prescribed organisations (e.g. the United Nations and its specialised agencies) are exempt from Australian tax. These International Agreements do not, however, provide for this exemption to be extended to employees of contractors who do business with the prescribed organisations. In the light of the general principle 1 have mentioned, I would not favour the creation of exemptions not required by the International Agreements. </para>

            <para>Two classifications of electorate allowances - city and country - were adopted by Parliament following recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry into Salaries and Allowances of Members of the Commonwealth Parliament in 1955. In its Report, the Committee said, inter alia, </para>
            <para>We realise that there is a difference between the expenses of a city Member who travels his electorate and returns home every evening and a country Member or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator who</inline> has hotel bills and extra travelling expenses to meet. (paragraph 37) . . . Travelling expenses withinthe electorate vary widely according to the size of the electorate and the concept of duty of the Member. It is obvious that in a compact city electorate, and even in the average outer suburban electorate, the expenses are not as high as those incurred in a country electorate. We have allowed something for both car and other travelling expenses in our recommendation for an electorate allowance&#39;. (Paragraphs 42 and 43). </para>
            <para class="block">The Committee of Enquiry into Salaries and Allowances in 1959 also recommended two classifications for electorate allowances and this was adopted by Parliament. The Second Schedule to the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952-1968, listing electorates for which the city rate of electorate allowance is paid, is as recommended by the Committee of Enquiry in 1959. </para>

              <para>I understand that Tasmanian growers are concerned at the reduction in price said to be offered by a processor for peas for freezing in the 1970-71 season. The Secretary of the Canning Pea Growers&#39; Association of Tasmania has written to me to express this concern. In my reply to him I have detailed the steps which have been taken by the Government to protect this industry. These include the establishment of an Australian industry panel with grower, processor and Departmental representation in which general industry discussions have proved of great value, and the establishment of an Australia/New Zealand panel in which are discussed questions of production and trade in the area, with the operations of the New Zealand/ Australia Free Trade Agreement in mind. </para>

              <para>In the matter of the contract between grower and processor, it would not seem appropriate for the Government to intervene in an industry agreement of this character. I understand that following a meeting of the Australian Industry Panel on 17th March processors and growers plan further meetings in the immediate future designed to find solutions to their common problems. </para>

              <para>Australian Ministers have made numerous statements in recent years in answer to questions in Parliament on the subject of chemical and biological warfare generally and, more specifically, on the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam. These are available in the Parliamentary library. The United States Government has also made numerous public statements on both matters. The latest of these, which dealt with United Slates&#39; policy on chemical and biological warfare, were made by President Nixon in Washington on 25th November 1969 and by the office of the White House Press Secretary at Key Biscayne, Florida, on 14th February 1970.  In  addition, the United States and the Australian Governments maintain close contact,  at  all appropriate levels, on the use of non-lethal chemicals in Vietnam. None of these activities, however, could be described as an exchange, or exchanges, of policy statements between Australia and the United States. </para>

            <para>Separate statistics are not available of income tax deductions for education expenses in respect of students attending institutions of each one of the . classes specified by the honourable member. Accordingly, no reliable estimates can be made of the cost to income tax revenue of allowing deductions for fees paid to each class of institution. However, it is estimated that the cost involved in respect of deductions for fees paid to all of the types of institutions mentioned would amount to a total of about $lm per annum. </para>

            <para>The latest statistical tables on indigenous workers in Papua and New Guinea, comparable with the tables for the year ended 31st March 1967 published in the Annual Reports for Papua and New Guinea, cover the year ended 30th June 1968. These statistics comprise twenty-two pages. A copy has been placed in the Parliamentary Library. </para>
            <para>As from 1967-68 labour statistics are being collected for the year ended 30th June in lieu of 31st March. The 1967-68 Annual Reports for Papua and New Guinea closed before the 1967-68 labour statistics had been compiled.

In Australia, for example, the rate of increase in gross national product at constant prices appears to have fluctuated markedly in the past five years; we know, in fact, that this largely reflects the downturn induced by severe drought in 1965- 66 and 1967-68 and the recovery therefrom in 1966-67 and 1968-69. </para>

            <para>Under the Child Welfare Ordinance 1961-1968 of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea an allowance not exceeding Seven dollars per week may be granted by tha Director of Child Welfare where one or both of the parents of a child under the age of sixteen years is imprisoned. In addition, the Administrator makes ex gratia grants to other dependants of persons in prison in deserving cases. Such grants are made by way of rations in subsistence farming areas and by cash, not exceeding Five dollars per family per week, in urban areas. However, such grants are required only in a few cases, as relatives in need are usually supported by kinsmen under traditional arrangements which are a feature of the family relationship of Papuans and New Guineans. The obligation to help a relative is often a binding customary obligation. Welfare officers regularly visit all major corrective institutions in the Territory and detainees are encouraged to discuss with them domestic matters including fears they may have for the well-being of their families. The decision whether to make grants of assistance or not is made on the basis of actual need, having regard to the customary support or other assistance that is being received by dependants of detainees. </para>
