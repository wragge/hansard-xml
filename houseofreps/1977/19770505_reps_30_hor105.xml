        <para>That abortion is the destruction of innocent human life. </para>
        <para>That on 10 May 1973, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly rejected the Medical Practices Clarification Bill, which sought to legalise abortion on demand in the Territories controlled by the Federal Government. </para>
        <para>That the Legislative Assembly in Canberra should consult Parliament again before discussing and debating the opening and operations of Population Services International and Preterm Foundation in Canberra. </para>
        <para>That the situation regarding abortions in the Australian Capital Territory is the same as that in New South Wales where the statute prohibits abortion but allows a defence. </para>

It is even difficult to see this enemy because it is not merely attacking us, but on a broad front is attacking the whole world order, its standards, its law and order, its moralities, its churches, its patriotisms, its philosophies and even much of its learning . . . &#39; </para>
        <para>That Communist Chinese infiltration in much of Africa over many years, and Cuban Communist troops reported to number 25 000 are dominating nearby Angola, and possess modern missiles etc. </para>
        <para>It is urgent that Mozambique, now under communist domination and which has a common border with Rhodesia, does not receive any further aid from the Commonwealth Government of Australia, which has benefited mainly the terrorist guerilla movements that are responsible for the deaths of many Rhodesian people. </para>
        <para>It is urgent for the Australian people to determine for themselves, the actual facts of the Rhodesian struggles. </para>
        <para>It is urgent that the Senate and the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled, will observe common justice and proper humanity by inviting only authorised representatives of the present Government of Rhodesia to Australia, to do what they have been deprived to do previously, present their case fully and publicly so that this can be examined and tested, without interference, and so that the eventual impact on Australia&#39;s own security and defence alliances can be gauged with better accuracy. </para>

            <para>- It is my understanding that the General Motors-Holden&#39;s proposal to advance a week&#39;s annual leave and offer it to its employees has not been received favourably by union members, despite some initial reaction of a more favourable kind by at least some of the union officials. I am informed that the management of the company will be meeting with the union leaders at approximately 2.30 p.m., today and I expect that some clarification will come from that meeting as to whether the men are prepared to accept a week&#39;s annual leave proposal or whether the company has any alternative proposals to put to them. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. In the first instance I must apologise to the Minister because I understand that the AttorneyGeneral was representing the Minister when I asked the question the other day. I now ask: Will the Minister confirm that interpreters attached to the Department of Social Security&#39;s telephone interpreter service, who used to assist doctors, lawyers, social workers and the police during interviews with non-English speaking migrants, can no longer offer this service because of the financial restrictions applied to the operations of the Department? Can the Minister assure the House that these restrictions will be lifted immediately so that non-English speaking migrants are guaranteed equality of access to medical, legal and social welfare services regardless of what language they speak? Will he ensure also that consideration is given during the preparation of the 1977-78 Budget to providing additional interpreters for this service to cope with the rising demand for assistance from professional and migrant organisations? </para>

I am not aware of the difficulty to which he refers, but I shall certainly convey his concern to the Minister for Social Security. Of course, if there is a shortage of interpreters, this would be a matter of great concern to the Government because the Government is concerned to ensure that the migrant community has interpreter services at all public institutions and facilities. I shall convey to the Minister and to the relevant Department the honourable member&#39;s concern about this matter. I thank him for bringing it to our attention. </para>

If the answer is no, will the Minister consider giving permission for such installations when application for a public telephone is made by a property owner, particularly in areas where vandalism continually renders adjoining public telephones inoperable? </para>

            <para>- The normal rule applying to public telephones is that they are to be accessible to the public. Therefore, in the main, they are on public property. But honourable members will recall a question last week concerning vandalism and the lack of service caused by it. If it is proved that there would be access to the public and that there is need, the Telecommunications Commission does not have an embargo against negotiation with private property owners on the installation of public telephones. So, the simple answer is that if there are people who have a private property in which there may be demonstrated a need for such installation we will be happy to do business with them. </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member for Fremantle indicates, the national trachoma campaign which is currently being conducted in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia has been responsible for detecting other illnesses in the course of the survey. The Department of Health is currently investigating the possibility of conducting some follow up program where the team has not been able to give proper and due attention to illnesses that have come to light. I agree that the campaign provides an opportunity actually to screen a great number of people for a variety of illnesses. I hope that it will be possible to ensure that, where other serious illnesses are detected, we are able to give due attention to them at the time the survey is conducted throughout the remote areas of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would also like to indicate at this stage that the trachoma campaign which is now being conducted, I think, in the northern part of the Northern Territory is still receiving assistance from the Department of Defence. It probably has been one of the best organised health programs in the remote areas of Australia and certainly will be responsible for overcoming a lot of the illnesses that presently are afflicting Aborigines and some white people in the remote areas of Australia. </para>

            <para>-I have not seen this morning&#39;s report but there certainly is a strong tendency for people in the media to equate worker participation with worker directors. The question of worker directors has been examined in a number of countries. Germany has had a system of dual boards, one being a policy board and one being an administrative supervisory board. There is, of course, great merit in that. To me, the most important thing in the area of worker participation is that there be a system of good communication. If individual management and labour believe they can achieve that by having worker directors, so be it. I have always been of the view that there ought to be industrial relations directors in all Australian companies. If there are boards with legal experts, financial experts and marketing experts and so forth, all of whom are directors, there ought not to be a personnel manager, there ought to be a personnel director because people are the most important asset of a company. That would go a long way towards improving communications and a long way towards having something resembling worker participation. I also believe that many companies ought to explore the idea of works councils and works committees. This would improve shop floor communication with the board and senior management. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is areas like that which the Government wishes to encourage individual management and unions to examine, rather than to adopt some symbolic notion of putting in a worker director when in fact that does not, of itself, improve communications between labour and management. I understand that the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales and South Australia has a policy of appointing worker directors. It is our view that this would not improve the communications between labour and management as such; in fact it could assist management in the sense that some members of the unions might understand better the problems of management. It would not necessarily improve communications between management and the shop floor, if the worker directors viewed their jobs as directors seriously and recognised that there were certain things they knew which they could not immediately tell the shop floor. If, in fact, they did then tell the shop floor immediately, that might prejudice a number of sensible policy decisions of the company. That could only be disruptive and would not improve things. </para>
          <para>Our view is that management and labour ought to explore together and agree together on the system which they want to adopt to improve communications. There is no point in management deciding on something and saying that it sounds good and then trying to impose it. There is certainly no point in governments trying to impose it. My understanding is that even in the European Economic Community, the draft resolution which led to the establishment of the Bullock Committee in the United Kingdom has now been withdrawn and the EEC does not intend to proceed with the idea of worker directors. </para>

Quite obviously increased union dues would add to the cost of living of those who are forced to join the trade union movement in order to gain a job in a particular vocation. I think it is worth noting now that on the implementation of this ACTU resolution the larger unions will have an income of up to about $ 10m a year. </para>

              <para>-About $10m a year. Their own administrations, of course, do not absorb anything like funds of that kind. Therefore very considerable funds would be left for political activities of one kind or another. Under those circumstances, I think it is imperative that there be a clear understanding by all trade unionists of the way in which trade unions spend their funds. We have the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney on the maritime unions. In that report it was recommended that there be annual reports and financial statements to members of unions so that those members could understand how their funds are being spent. These matters obviously are under close examination by the Government. The nature of the ACTU resolution and the wealth that it would provide in the hands of a significant number of trade union leaders make it all the more imperative that rank and file members of the trade union movement have an understanding of the way in which their money is in fact being spent. I know the honourable gentleman would prefer the Australian Council of Trade Unions to contribute to a move against inflation by changing that resolution and having union charges reduced. If that is not possible, the best that the Government could do, I should think, would be to make quite clear that union management will have to advise its members on a regular basis of the way in which funds are spent so that it will be to a greater extent accountable for that than has been the case in the past. </para>

            <para>-It is true that, at a time when most of Australia is enjoying very excellent pasture conditions, drought conditions prevail in the honourable gentleman&#39;s electorate and in some parts of southern New South Wales. The Commonwealth has a long-standing arrangement with the States which ensures that Commonwealth backing is given after a certain minimal expenditure is undertaken by the States. Alternatively where a natural disaster is of such an order that the States feel that joint funding of relief is preferable that option has been provided to the States. I sympathise with the honourable gentleman&#39;s constituents and can assure him and, through him, them that adequate facilities are already available through the State Government for assistance in whatever way may be necessary to alleviate their present plight. If the honourable gentleman has information on particular instances I would suggest that he take the matter up initially with the State Government and the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>State Government will then process the applications in the normal way. So far as I am aware, at this stage no request has been received from the Victorian Government for supplementary assistance; but, as I explained, the whole range of facilities for drought relief are essentially provided by State governments- in this instance by the Victorian or New South Wales Government. Any request that is passed on from them will be considered in the category of the normal arrangements that have existed for some time and certainly will be considered sympathetically by the Federal Government. </para>

That covers the savings bank area of the residential sector of the building industry. I have quoted the Executive Director of the Australian Association of Permanent Building Societies.

            <para>-I am aware of the problem and I am concerned about it. The honourable members for Dawson, Leichhardt, Kennedy and the Northern Territory will know well and truly that I have travelled in their electorates looking at problems concerned with television. It is a fact of life that over 90 per cent of Australians do have access to television, although that applies to only about 1 5 per cent of the land mass. The problems do not exist only in the rural areas, although they are very significant there, but also in parts of the capital cities. The honourable member for Sturt has mentioned to me a problem he has had in Adelaide in which the terrain presents difficulties with television facilities. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Maranoa asked what progress has been made. Some progress has been made; I would wish more to be made. </para>
          <para class="block">The Department has the matter under study. I have had a look at the program that is desirable, because this problem affects all States of Australia. As to resources, it is a question of what finance can be made available, and we have to bear in mind the budgetary restraints presently before us. There is also a problem of manpower. We need technicians and engineers if we are to have the right sort of program. Finally, the honourable member asked whether satellites were the ultimate solution. I think the answer to that question is that they are the ultimate solution, but this is something which is a fair distance away, although perhaps not as far away as some people suspect. One of the officers of my Department was overseas only a few months ago making a study of satellites. We are linking into the world system, and I hope that in the not too distant future we can use satellites as part of the solution. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that the air transport section of the Department of Transport has embarked on a cost recovery program from civil aviation of 80 per cent? Will the Minister confirm that this program has now resulted in a return of 1 14 per cent? Is the Government embarrassed by this result? Will the Minister indicate what move he will make to rationalise the situation? </para>

            <para>-It is a fact that the previous Administration sought to raise 80 per cent in a cost recovery program by 1978. The House will recall that, on assumption of government, we put a stop to that. The program required an increase in some charges of up to 300 per cent in the 1975-76 financial year to enable the Budget target to be met. The Government has the matter under review. The honourable member&#39;s figure of 1 14 per cent is not correct if applied to all aviation in Australia. In fact, a 1 14 per cent recovery applies in particular to international aircraft flying into Australia. The reason for the over estimate of recovery arises from the fact that there was a greater number of aircraft movements than expected, including the movements generally of international aircraft into and out of Australia in this year. The average recovery rate of all sectors of aviation now rests at about 60 per cent. I can give the honourable member some percentages that are fairly accurate. The recovery rate is about 114 per cent for international operations, about 73 per cent for the major domestic operators, about 26 per cent for rural airlines such as East West Airlines Ltd and about 18 per cent for general aviation. That is about the level of cost recovery at the present time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other point I must make is that the international operators are tied to the 2-airline policy in respect of the rate of recovery. Until the 2- airline policy is reviewed we are unable to change the rate of recovery for the major domestic operators as distinct from the international operators. Of course we will be looking at the situation in the Budget context. </para>

            <para>- I am informed that during the last 6 months the conservator of fine arts and the curator of art at the Australian War Memorial have resigned. Action is in hand to appoint a scientist to head the Australian War Memorial conservation laboratory. This is a new position. Action is also being taken to review salary levels of conservation staff employed throughout the Commonwealth services. There are few trained conservators in Australia to meet the demands of our museums and art galleries. It is also a fact that no academic institution until the present time has a course of training in these skills. However, I understand that the Canberra College of Advanced Education hopes to start a course of this kind next year. In the meantime, the only course of action available to us is to attract qualified and experienced staff from abroad to undertake this work. We are fully aware of the valuable collections in the Australian War Memorial and we are taking positive steps to ensure that they are properly looked after. </para>

Because of the natural reluctance of foreign companies to manufacture Austalian cars with Australian inventiveness such as that shown by Pritchard, Everingham and Sarich, will the Prime Minister consider the Government exploring the opportunity to form an international consortium with Australian, Japanese, United States and German interests whereby there could be a world wide motor car produced using the talents of Australians on the basis that the work force in Australia would at least be able to be employed manufacturing part of a car, thereby guaranteeing the utilisation of Australian talent as well as the utilisation of a world market? </para>

            <para>- I have nothing to add on that subject to what I said yesterday. I would say, however, that there is a security organisation in Australia which has a responsibility to report to the Government any matters which, within the statutory charter of that organisation, ought to be reported to it. It is the statutory obligation of that organisation to survey all foreign intelligence activities and agencies. If it detected anything untoward I am sure that the agency would report. I have the highest confidence in the director of the agency who was appointed by my predecessor. I hope that my predecessor also has the highest confidence in his own appointee. </para>

            <para>- Does the Minister for Transport recall that in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Wilmot on 28 April he said that he considered it unlikely that the south bound component of the freight equalisation scheme to Tasmania would include fresh fruit and vegetables? Can the Minister explain why he believes that those commodities would be excluded from the scheme whilst Tasmanian growers of fruit and vegetables can benefit under the north bound provisions of the scheme? Does the Minister realise that he could be denying the people of Tasmania access to high quality, nutritious fruit such as apples grown in premier mainland fruit growing areas in the electorates of Calare, Hume, Maranoa, New England, Mitchell, Macquarie and many others? </para>

              <para>- The Tasmanians are not going to find out, because the freight equalisation scheme will not be permitted to extend to include fruit and vegetables. So I am afraid that Tasmanians are going to be starved of goods of the quality of those grown in electorates such as Gippsland, Indi and others. In all seriousness, the freight equalisation scheme for Tasmania has been designed to assist Tasmanian industry. It was designed chiefly to try to give a boost to manufacturing industry in Tasmania. I think that the north bound scheme is proving to be very successful in that regard and it is also proving to be beneficial for the general economy of Tasmania. It was an initiative taken by this Government which has, I think, been well received by the Tasmanian people. I repeat that fresh fruit and vegetables are unlikely to be included in the south bound freight equalisation scheme because they are domestic consumption products as distinct from manufacturing products used for the production of goods for re-export to the mainand. I would like to give consideration to the honourable member&#39;s question because I know that many Gippsland growers could take advantage of his suggestion, if implemented. </para>

There seems no need for me to try to extend the possibilities of the desperate honourable member for Oxley as he tries now to appeal to the left wing of the Party that deserted him as he deserted those views which he formerly held. All I will say is that I have indicated already that what was to be a holiday seemingly turned out to be some sort of semi-official visit when people arrived and completely surprised me. As I have said, they too have corroborated that. I have nothing further to add.

          <para>- For the information of honourable members I present the monthly reports of the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust Fund for October, November and December 1976 and January, February, March and April of 1977. Due to the limited number available, reference copies of these papers have been placed in the Bills and Papers Office of the House of Representatives and the Parliamentary Library. </para>

I ask that you refer to the Committee of Privileges the action of the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> today in moving the motion that he moved in that firstly, it is an attempt to intimidate members in the future from raising matters in the House in accordance with the forms of the House; secondly, it was a deliberate reflection on the Chair which had ruled my motion of 26 April in order, over the objection of the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes);</inline> thirdly, it seeks to prevent free speech in this House and is at the very least premature until the issues raised in my motion are dealt with; and, fourthly, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that my motion of 26 April did not contain matter to which the honourable member for Chifley referred today and that his errors in quotation today must be a deliberate misleading of the House. I have waited until after question time before raising this matter in order that the Business of the House may proceed. </para>

          <para>-If an honourable member wishes to raise a matter of privilege, he must establish to the satisfaction of the  Speaker  that there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case of privilege. The honourable gentleman has failed to satisfy me on that on any count. I do not interpret the actions of the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> as in any sense either attempting to or likely to intimidate other members of this House. I did not regard the motion as in any way a reflection on the Chair. The motion of the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> was not ruled in order; it was received as a notice of motion. I do not accept the point of the honourable member for St George that the notice of motion of the honourable member for Chifley is premature in anticipating a debate. That, m fact, would amount to a reflection on the Chair. What was put by the honourable member for Chifley was a notice of motion, which he was entitled to do. In future, a motion of that character would not be accepted, as I indicated to the House. I accepted that motion having regard to the fact that the motion of the honourable member for St George had been accepted earlier. There is no issue of privilege. </para>

            <para>- The motion raised by the honourable member for Chifley today quoted my motion incorrectly. Firstly I did not say that the document had been delivered to the former Government on 25 August. I said that the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> had reported to that effect. Secondly, I referred to statements made recently by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malik,</inline> to a journalist and not to a leaked document in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malik</inline> had allegedly made some statements to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacEachen.</inline> At the time of my motion there had been no denial by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E.

            <para>- What the honourable gentleman says has a great deal of merit. In fact like the honourable gentleman I have listened to the tape. I have a clear recollection of the events and the tape satisfied me that my recollection is correct. It is that I put the question that the paper be printed and that was passed. Then the honourable gentleman moved for the adjournment of the debate, there being at that point nothing to adjourn. But the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report does in fact record the passing of the motion to print the paper as coming after the statements by the honourable gentleman and me and, therefore, to subsequent readers perhaps would give a wrong impression. I have spoken to the Principal Parliamentary Reporter and he has indicated to me that he is satisfied that the passing of the motion ought to appear before the passage between the honourable gentleman and myself. Were this done, that which the honourable gentleman is concerned about, that is, giving a basis for a wrong ruling, would be removed. It would not be altering the evidence after the event; it is making sure that the record of the proceedings is accurate. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition does not oppose the motion, the terms of which were announced to the House some time ago. But, on behalf of the Opposition, I ask the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> whether he can give us a detailed program of what legislation the Government expects to pass before the end of this session. I think it would be valuable for the House to know exactly what is expected of it before the end of this session, especially as the timetable as at present set out would appear to provide very limited time, and also as fairly extensive arrangements already have been entered into by committees of the House and otherwise for the week following the week on which we are listed to rise, which is a week in which I think there is a very great likelihood that we will be still sitting. If some advance notice were given of what legislation the Government anticipates being passed or requires to be passed in this session and what legislation it intends to stand over it not only may help honourable members to prepare their plans for the 2 weeks of sitting but also will give them some idea of what the future program is likely to be. </para>

        <para class="block">This matter is an involved one. It is not easy to present it to the House in such a concise way as to allow considered judgment by the House. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, noted</inline> the problems with the detail that was given with the notice of motion. This exemplifies some of the difficulties that occur. As far as I know, there are no fresh, startling revelations in this matter. All the factors germane to the matter are known. In this matter that I have raised the House is not being asked to determine the qualifications of the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume).</inline> Its attention is being drawn to section 45 (ii) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, which provides among other things, that if a member of the House of Representatives takes the benefit, whether by assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors his place shall thereupon become vacant. The House is then being asked to take note that, from a variety of sources, it has been suggested that the honourable member for Macarthur has taken advantage of such an arrangement; so there is doubt as to his qualifications to sit. Following upon these 2 factors it is suggested that the House should facilitate the process of judicial determination of the matter rather than take it upon itself to determine it. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Electoral Act provides for the Court of Disputed Returns to deal with such matters. In a matter where precise legal interpretation is required it is preferable for the Court to do so rather than for the House to decide the matter on what would be seen by people outside the Parliament to be .party political grounds and so reduce the dignity of the Parliament itself. There are recent parallels in this course to be followed. The Senate in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> wisely decided that, as the matter was one of legal interpretation, it should go to the Court. In that case the Court cleared <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> of any doubt. Another case recently was the case in Victoria when the qualifications of Bunna Walsh to sit as a member of the Legislative Council were challenged on the basis of a conviction many years before in the children&#39;s court. In that the case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walsh</inline> was disqualified. However, there was such revulsion about a children&#39;s court penalty being raised in this way that subsequent legislation has removed this as a cause of disqualification there. </para>
        <para>I cite those cases because they emphasise the desirability of the process of judicial inquiry being pursued. It is the duty of the courts to interpret the law. Our responsibility is to make the law. One cannot expect other people to have respect for the dignity of the membership of this House unless we accord it a high degree of dignity and respect. In saying this I am dealing with the latter part of the motion first. I have done this deliberately so that my request for action by the House is seen clearly. Having done that I must move to establish that doubt does exist with regard to the honourable member for Macarthur &#39;s qualifications to sit in this House. The collapse of Patrick Partners is a matter of public notoriety. It has been the subject of much examination, discussion and even litigation. All sorts of issues have been raised, including dishonest actions by financial journalists, dumping of holdings at inflated prices and so on. But this is not the matter for discussion further today. </para>

            <para>- Let us consider the validity of the partnership of the honourable member for Macarthur, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume,</inline> in Patrick Partners. I understand that there has been some dispute with regard to the type of partnership and the actual dates concerned. Let me deal with this by quoting a paragraph from page 86 of the Masterman report. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>On the evidence before me I am satisfied that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> continued to be a partner of Patrick Partners subsequent to February 1975 and indeed continued to be a partner up to the date the Partnership closed its doors. As he explained in evidence he was constrained by debts which he owed the Partnership to continue in law to remain a member of the Partnership even though his intention was not to return to it. In my view his signature on the various documents connected with the renewal of his Dealer&#39;s Licence in June 1975 constitute clear admission that he remained a partner. Further support for the conclusion I have reached can also be drawn from his involvement in the discussions which took place on Sunday the 27th of July. Accordingly in the balance of this Report I proceed on the basis that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> was at all times during the period with which I am concerned a partner of Patrick Partners who had been given leave of absence at the end of February 1975 and had relatively little contact with the affairs of the firm thereafter. </para>

        <para>The first sentence is surely the relevant one that the House has to note, particularly that part that states: </para>

        <para>Constraints of time lead me to ask the House to take note of the information given in the motion regarding factors in the deeds of arrangement and so on. Time does not allow us to deal with all the material that is in these things. The judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sheppard that I have mentioned refers to some of the advantages of deeds of arrangements. He said in opening: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I do not wish to say more than that I think that in the interests of many persons concerned with the failure of Patrick Partners a much more detailed investigation than could be carried out in these adversary proceedings is called for. Regrettably the fact that there is an arrangement pursuant to Pt. X of the Bankruptcy Act means, so long as that situation continues, that there will be no public examination of the debtors. The provisions of sec. 69 of the Act are not picked up by Pt. X: et. sec. 231. I think that this is a case where public examination of the leading figures in the debacle which occurred is called for. The members of the firm were, after all, fiduciary agents and there is here revealed material which is capable of suggesting that some at least of the members of the firm may have acted towards their principals in breach of their obligations. </para>

        <para class="block">Using this comment, which shows the benefits of the deeds of arrangement, I turn to the allegation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume,</inline> now the honourable member for Macarthur, additionally and separately received the benefits of arrangements made under Part X of the Bankruptcy Act 1956 by the partners. This is because the effect of clause 9 of the deeds of arrangement is to prevent any actions from being brought against the honourable member for Macarthur for the debts of Patrick Partners by any creditors, including creditors who may have, or have had, claims against the honourable member, and also to release him from obligations or liabilities at the expiration of 5 years. This can be seen in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley&#39;s judgment of 2 1 September 1 976 in which he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The effect of the provisions relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> which the deeds contain is that $ 106,082 contributed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> may be available for distribution among the creditors that would not otherwise be available, with the added advantage of the avoidance of litigation against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> over his liabilities to creditors and by him over his entitlement to indemnity from his former partners. In my opinion there is nothing in those provisions that offends any provision of the Act, and each of the eleven deeds is valid and binding on each of the first four respondents. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Riley in this case gave much attention to other matters as they affected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> before he made this statement. In the statement he clearly referred to the benefit derived by the honourable member for Macarthur from these arrangements made under the Bankruptcy Act. He made further comments on page 4 of the judgment. He said: </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline>did, as contemplated by the opening words of CI. 9, complete an agreement to make arrangements for the satisfaction of the debt of $106,082 claimed to be due by him to the firm. He did so by executing a deed (which I shall call the Baume deed &#39;), also on 1 9 March 1 976; and he has complied with the requirements of the relevant covenant in that deed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">So it was not only a matter of the other partners coming to a deed of arrangement, but it was also a matter of the honourable member for Macarthur taking part in such a deed. It is to this very type of arrangement that section 45(2) of the Constitution refers. One has to refer to relevant dates in this matter. The honourable member for Macarthur was elected on 13 December 1975. The deeds of arrangement I refer to were signed on 19 March 1976. It would seem to me that both the eminent jurists, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sheppard, have found that the deed of arrangement signed by the partners of Patrick Partners on 19 March 1976 are now operating validly, and because they are operating validly they now provide a benefit under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to the honourable member. </para>
        <para>Having shown that and having raised that doubt, this surely should be of concern to the House. As I have submitted previously, in order to put the issue beyond any doubt- certainly to me much doubt exists- the House should show respect for itself and show its seriousness with regard to the qualifications of members by not impeding in any way a judicial inquiry and a judicial decision in this matter. On these grounds I try to make no absolute judgment. I have tried to show that the materials that exist raise a doubt about the qualifications of the honourable member for Macarthur. These materials are freely available to all. When that doubt exists I believe that the House should support my motion for reference of this matter to the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>

          <para>- I second the motion, and I speak at this stage because I understand that the Government intends to put up only one speaker-and that will not be the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume).</inline> Accordingly, I am obliged to speak now. The Government proposes then to stop the debate after the  speaker  from its side concludes. I would have preferred to be able to answer any case that may have been put up. The issue is not one of personality; it is one of the Constitution and the obligations of members of this Parliament. So it does not matter what personalities we have to mention during the course of this debate. What is at issue could apply to any one of us. The Constitution provides that a bankrupt cannot be chosen as a member of Parliament. That immediately means that 1 1 of the 12 members of Patrick Partners could never be chosen as members of this House. They are bankrupts. The issue is whether the twelfth member, that is, the honourable member for Macarthur, is a bankrupt within the meaning of the Constitution. There is no contest as to the validity of his election but there is contest whether he is entitled to remain here. The Constitution does state that any member who takes the benefit, whether by assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankruptcy or insolvency shall forfeit his seat. Of course, it can be said that that is a legal matter, and so it is, and relates to the ramifications of whether we, in this Parliament, with all our limitations, are entitled to say: &#39;You have taken the benefit of an insolvency provision in the Bankruptcy Act and, therefore, you must forfeit your seat&#39; Lumb and Ryan clearly make the point that we should not necessarily debate this matter in detail but that we have an obligation, where the matter is raised and where the Parliament itself has provided for these matters to be determined by a court, to have them determined by a court. The motion moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Scullin <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Jenkins),</inline> does not propose that we pass judgment here but that the <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> facts clearly indicate that the High Court should determine the matter on the merits. I think that would also be in the interests of the honourable member because, if he is acquitted of any suggestion that he has taken the benefit, nothing further would happen. If we do not allow the matter to go to the court, there will always be the stigma that the Parliament was used to protect a member of the Government, and that is not in the interests of good democracy or good government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Lumb and Ryan clearly draw a distinction between people who are bankrupt and people who have taken advantage of bankruptcy. In other words, bankruptcy can be avoided by using the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, which clearly was done by the honourable member for Macarthur. I do not think he has ever denied that and it is stated in the Masterman report. But, for the sake of the House and as a basis on which it should pass the motion to permit this course to be followed, these are the fact. The honourable member for Macarthur joined the firm called Patrick Partners and was registered as a partner under the Business Names Act of New South Wales, together with 1 1 other members. Under the State law, he held himself out to be a partner. That law provides that, if a person wishes to retire from a partnership, he must give notice of such dissolution. Section 36 of the New South Wales Partnership Act provides that, if a person retires from a partnership, he must advertise his retirement in a local newspaper or in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> He has to give notice to people who, if they deal with a partnership not knowing that he has retired from it, are entitled to hold him responsible. Particulars of registration of the business name of Patrick Partners were not changed, and no evidence was ever given to the public that the honourable member had retired from the partnership. If the provisions of the law were applied, the honourable member would be liable for all the debts of Patrick Partners. </para>
        <para>Masterman &#39;s report clearly shows that Patrick Partners was insolvent to the extent of an enormous amount of money. It was insolvent in the sense that it was unable to pay its creditors. Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Act had to be utilised to protect Patrick Partners in the sense that it might be able to make some arrangements, and that it did. The Bankruptcy Act, which is a Federal Act, clearly states how that may be done. Section 188 of the Act provides that, if a person wishes to avoid the sequestration of his estatenot bankruptcy but sequestration- he must sign an authority under section 188 appointing a trustee. The honourable member for Macarthur did that, and Masterman found that he did it. Accordingly, there is no dispute that that authority was signed and that it was signed while he was a member of this Parliament. Section 40 of the Bankruptcy Act clearly states that any person who signs an authority under section 188 of the Act has committed an act of bankruptcy. </para>
        <para>So, we have all the ingredients necessary to say that there is insolvency. There is membership of a partnership and there is an act of bankruptcy. Then, we come to the final point raised by the honourable member for Scullin. Has an advantage been taken to avoid the ultimate fate of being a bankrupt by saying: &#39;I have entered into an arrangement and taken the benefit to avoid that stigma&#39;? While a person might be able to avoid the stigma of bankruptcy, he cannot avoid the ramifications of the Constitution of this nation, which provides that if a person has entered into that sort of arrangement he is liable to have his seat declared vacant. There is a very good reason for that. The Opposition does not put this on a personal basis, but any member of this Parliament who is beholden to others because of debt or other liability may well have his judgment on matters such as national security legislation confined or restricted because of obligation to others. The honourable member himself in the evidence given to Masterman admitted such a possibility in his endeavours, as he said, to get out of the partnership. The big issue in relation to public interest is that a number of creditors of Patrick Partners have been to members of Parliament asking why it is that only 1 1 people appear to be involved and that a member of Parliament seems to be exempt. They cannot understand it. They think that some special preference, some special privilege, has been given to a member of this House. Nevertheless, it has to be said that there is no chance of any member of this Parliament obtaining any special privilege or any special preference. In fact, he should be the first to go before a judicial tribunal to say: &#39;I have done no wrong. &#39; </para>
        <para>The question here is one of the legal actions of the honourable member for Macarthur, and again I repeat them. He was a member of a partnership who never took any action to say that he was no longer a member by registering the appropriate forms or by advertising in the appropriate newspapers. According to the Masterman report, he admitted that he was a member of the partnership when he signed a statutory declaration to renew his membership to enable him to retain his stocks and shares licence, and I think he did that at some time in June 197S. He signed an authority in July 197S stating that the partnership was unable to meet its debts and that, according to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, he was signing the authority and appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jamison</inline> to be his trustee. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jamison</inline> then entered into arrangements with creditors whereby the honourable member would pay $106,000 by 30 June, or such other period as the committee of inspection would allow, to enable him to avoid litigation. As the honourable member for Scullin said, the benefit was taken by that action of paying a sum of money. I might say in passing that $106,000 was substantially more than any of the other partners had to pay. The committee of inspection told me personally that it had not approved the deed because it was defective in the sense of consideration being valuable consideration. </para>
        <para>Other public interest matters are involved, although we need not go into them. However, the creditors certainly want them raised on the basis whether a member of Parliament should say that he is going to pay $106,000 and then $ 106,000 is not paid. That is the simple approach of the creditors on this issue. Further, they are hostile towards the trustee, although we need not debate this, on the matter of whether or not he carried out his duties. The deed was supposed to be made with the approval of the committee of inspection and the committee has said that it did not approve that deed. Nevertheless, the deed does exist because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley adverted to it. People named Allen wished to pursue the honourable member because he was a partner and therefore personally liable for the debts of the partnership, but when they sought to pursue their legal rights, which they would be entitled to do, they were met by an injunction instituted by Jamison preventing them from doing so because of the deed of arrangement.  His  Honor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley said that the deed stood. It was a valid deed and meant that the honourable member had compounded his obligations, had taken advantage of not being jointly and severally liable for the whole of the debts of the partnership but was liable for a sum of only $106,000. But he can avoid litigation because he gets the benefit of that deed, and that was clearly spelled out when, as my colleague has already mentioned,  His  Honor found the deed to be validthat is the Baume deed- and that the money would be available for creditors, with the added advantage of the avoidance of litigation. In other words, the honourable member is in a very special position because the Bankruptcy Act provides that creditors cannot sue in any court of this country if a person takes the benefit of an assignment which is recognised by the bankruptcy law. When Allen, a creditor, sought to enforce his rights on the basis that Baume was different from the others, because he had said that he was not a member of the partnership and therefore Allen could attack that issue in the court, he was prevented from so doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> do you not there see that people in this country who think they are entitled to press their claims against the honourable member would feel that he is being put into a very sheltered and special position of which no other person has been able to get advantage? </para>
        <para>We raise the matter on that issue. Nobody in this Parliament should be associated with that sort of attitude and be able to say: &#39;I am not a member of the partnership. That is good enough. I have no interest in it. I have paid $106,000&#39;. I point out that that is disputed. An honourable member cannot say that that is good enough because it is not. The honourable member could well have paid the $106,000 but that is denied. He could well have entered into the deed of arrangement and, of course, would still fall within the ambit of section 45 of the Constitution in that he has taken advantage of a composition of arrangement, which he has done. If the liability of Patrick Partners to creditors is deemed to be about $lm, those creditors are entitled to sue each and every one of those partners for the sum of $lm. That is the law. A person cannot abrogate his responsibility on the basis that he has a deed of arrangement which states that that will hold him out of court. It will to the extent that it states the person cannot be sued because he has taken advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. But once the person concerned does that, he cannot say that the Parliament cannot do anything about the matter either. The issue is that the honourable member has taken advantage of this position. Therefore, he would be a prisoner of some provisions of the Bankruptcy Act and really is not a free agent in the Parliament. </para>
        <para>Perhaps this can be disproved but it can be disproved only by legal argument in the High Court of Australia. That is the appropriate place to put such arguments. Politics does not enter into this matter on the basis that Parliament itself has provided within section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act that: </para>

I would think that it would be in the interest of every member of the House to see that when these accusations are made they are properly determined by an impartial judicial body before which evidence can be given. </para>
        <para>The issue is this: Masterman clearly found that Baume was a member of the partnership. Baume denied that he signed the authority in an effective form. But the authority under section 188 was signed by Baume in July and witnessed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Applegate</inline> of Sly and Russell. So the issue, when it came before Masterman, was not challenged on the basis that the authority was not signed; it was challenged on the basis that it was not properly witnessed. This is what Baume has said. If we look at the evidence given by Applegate, we find that he really denies that, although he cannot get it in detail. He denies that there was any suggestion that the authority was not signed in his presence. That is very clear. In fact, one wonders how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Applegate</inline> could continue to practise in New South Wales as a solicitor if he allowed himself to be so impugned as the honourable member has impugned him on the basis that he witnessed a document when he should not have witnessed it. </para>
        <para class="block">I find that when we look at all the facts, sym- pathetic as we may be to any honourable memer of this Parliament who has financial liabilitiesthat could happen to any one of us- the issue is the Constitution itself and the problems in that Consitution for members of Parliament. People have great responsibilities when they enter this Parliament. They have the obvious responsibility of saying to the electors, whether they be in the electorate of Macarthur or anywhere else: &#39;I did not take any special advantage. I received no special preference. I am perhaps worse off than most of you. I have to face up to accusations in the Parliament&#39;. When accusations of the substance I have put are made, they should not be decided here by resolution to determine the guilt or otherwise of the honourable member; they should be referred to the High Court on the basis that there they can be determined. The Court can determine whether the honourable member has taken a benefit or whether he has not. The creditors think he has. Most people in Australia would think that he has. Perhaps there is an answer. If there is, to be sustained it would have to deny the validity of the Masterman report. </para>

            <para>- If he is not, he had better make it clear. This question is basically one of interpretation of the Constitution. It is a question of law. The facts in this matter that are relevant are not really in dispute so far as I understand them although there may be some variation here and there. It is a question of whether the Constitution catches up the position of the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> in such a way as to cause his seat to be declared vacant. Section 47 of the Constitution states: </para>

          <para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting the qualification of a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator or</inline> of a member of the House of Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act does bring in a qualification to that and enables this House, if it wishes, to send the matter off to the Court of Disputed Returns. It is the Government &#39;s view in this matter that, because of the question and the answer that can be given to it, this House should determine the matter and not send it off to the High Court of Australia. </para>
        <para>I ask honourable members who have a regard for this matter to listen to what I say. As I understand it, although some emotive phrases were used by the honourable member for KingsfordSmith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> basically honourable members have attempted to approach the subject in the way I suggested, namely, as a question of law applied to the facts. I ask honourable members opposite to listen carefully because I am anxious that they should understand what I am about to say and what I am about to put to the House and that they should feel some confidence in what I am about to say because I will put it as the first law officer of the Commonwealth and not in any other way. </para>
        <para>One thing that is important to understand is this: Section 44 of the Constitution, in dealing with people who shall be incapable of being chosen- that is chosen or elected to this Houserefers in the relevant part to a person who is an undischarged bankrupt or who is insolvent. So the thrust of this section is to take some action in relation to a person who is insolvent. However, that is not the section that is relevant to this matter because the honourable member is neither bankrupt nor insolvent in the sense that the words are used in that section. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I make the point right at the outset- it is very important to understand this-that there is no evidence that the honourable member is insolvent or has been insolvent. That is a very important fact to bear in mind and I ask honourable members to understand it. If they do not understand it and comprehend it at the beginning, they will get caught up in all sorts of emotional exercises. I ask honourable members to bear that in mind. </para>

        <para class="block">I emphasise the word &#39;thereupon &#39;- become vacant. </para>
        <para class="block">It is important first of all to note that if a person had taken the benefit prior to his becoming a member- that is to say, at a time prior to his electionthe fact that he had entered into a deed of arrangement in the strict sense to which I will refer subsequently, would not preclude him from being elected because section 44 (iii) refers to an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent. Neither of those terms applies to a person who has taken the benefit, whether by assignment, composition or otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors. I point that out to honourable members. It is not essential to what I am about to say but I point it out. </para>
        <para>When we read those words &#39;takes the benefit ... of any law&#39; and apply them to the Bankruptcy Act we find that the Bankruptcy Act deals not just with debtors, people who owe money to others. The word &#39;debtor&#39; means a person who is unable to pay his debts, as they become due, out of his own moneys. That has a specific meaning. I guess we are all debtors in one sense, but I hope that none of us is so unfortunate as to be a debtor in the sense in which that section defines that word. That again is an important matter and it is relevant to what I referred to earlier, namely, that there is no evidence before this House to suggest that the honourable member for Macarthur was at any relevant time a person who was unable to pay his debts as they became due out of his own moneys. That in itself is not basic to what I am saying, but I point it out to honourable members. </para>
        <para>The basic point to understand is that this Act applies to people who find themselves unable to pay their debts as they become due. Section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act speaks of a debtor (being such a person) who desires that his affairs be dealt with &#39;under this Part&#39; without his estate being sequestrated. Again it emphasises that it is a person taking the benefit of this Act, that is, taking benefit by way of a deed of arrangement. He or she can enter into a deed of arrangement if he or she so wishes, but it must be in accordance with the Act. I do not want to take the House through the various provisions of the Act, but it does contain technical provisions for the execution of the deed following a meeting of the creditors. There is provision for the appointment of a trustee. It is made quite clear that a deed of arrangement is a particular document which is executed by the trustee and by a person called a debtor. The honourable member for Macarthur at no time purported to act as a debtor within the meaning of Part X of the Bankruptcy Act. That is quite clear. What honourable members opposite are seeking to do, with respect, is to convict him for a course of action which he did not take but might have taken. They are seeking to do that instead of concentrating on the basically important issue, and that is what in fact he did. </para>
        <para>Judgments have been referred to. The judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley has been referred to. That judgment raised the question of the validity of the deeds of arrangement. We should read in association with those deeds the deed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume</inline> executed. Let us be clear about the fact that he did not execute a deed of arrangement. That is quite clear. He executed another deed; it was not a deed of arrangement. Honourable members opposite can call it a deed of arrangement if they want to do so, but I can assure them that it is not a deed of arrangement within the meaning of the law. It was not so treated before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Riley. There is no basis on which it can be asserted to be a deed of arrangement. One might say that it was a deed executed contemporaneously with a deed of arrangement but not executed by him as a debtor under this Act as a deed of arrangement. If honourable gentlemen opposite wish to assert simply that it is a deed of arrangement, I think they will find it very difficult to back up that assertion. Section 233 of the Bankruptcy Act provides: </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(">
            <para>1 ) A deed of arrangement that is entered into in accordance with this Pan and complies with the requirements of this Part is, upon being duly executed by the debtor and the trustee, binding on all the creditors of the debtor. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">That section gives force and effect to those eleven deeds of arrangement which were executed by the 1 1 partners of Patrick Partners. None of those deeds was executed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Baume.</inline></para>

I have already made the point that the honourable member for </para>

        <para class="block">Macarthur was never a debtor within the meaning of the Act. He never executed a deed of arrangement. The Act says that upon a deed being duly executed it is binding on all the creditors of the debtor. I refer to that simply to indicate to honourable members how it was that, by virtue of the execution of the deeds of arrangement by the 1 1 Patrick partners, clause 9 of that deed became binding on the creditors. Of course, that had the effect of enabling the settlement of disputes between the honourable member for Macarthur and the trustee. They were settled in a way which was thought to be advantageous to the creditors of Patrick Partners. I do not want to say any more about that matter; I simply want to explain to honourable members how the deed executed by the honourable member for Macarthur became relevant. </para>

        <para class="block">The question is: Has the honourable member for Macarthur, on the facts as we known them, taken the benefit- not on the facts as they might have been, but on the facts as they occurred, with the deeds executed by the 1 1 Patrick Partners and with the deed executed by the honourable member for Macarthur? That is the question. As I said at the beginning, this is basically a question of interpretation and the application of the Constitution to those facts. </para>
        <para>The matter has been considered by the Solicitor-General and myself and we have approached it on the basis of the facts as we understand them. We have set them out in a joint opinion. Having considered the facts, we have formed a firm opinion that the place of the honourable member has not become vacant. I table in the House our joint opinion on the matter. It is a considered opinion and I say to members of the House that it is a firm opinion. The honourable member for Macarthur has made available to me a copy of an opinion which he obtained from a previous Attorney-General, who I believe is well respected- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes,</inline> Queen&#39;s Counsel. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes</inline> also expresses a firm view that the seat of the honourable member for Macarthur has not become vacant. Another opinion obtained by the honourable member for Macarthur at an earlier stage- in April 1976- from junior counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Bennett of the New South Wales Bar, is to the same effect. I also table those opinions. </para>
        <para>I do so simply on the basis that inevitably in a debate in this House, honourable members opposite would want to say the sorts of things they have said already this morning. They have tried to throw up some doubt based on some emotive approach to the facts in this particular case. Of course this is designed to put the honourable member for Macarthur in a position he should not be put in. With very great respect, honourable members opposite should accept the proposition that this question of law is quite clear and has been quite clearly answered. There is no need for the matter to be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns. Therefore, the Government wants this matter to be decided by this House. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I do. During the recently concluded debate the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> alleged several things which are untrue. These were presented as facts in that debate; facts which affect me and certainly damage me. The honourable member said that I had clearly used the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. That is untrue. At no stage have I used the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act to seek any special privilege. He said further that I was given special privilege as a member of this House. No privilege was sought; none has been received. He claimed that I had executed a deed of arrangement under the Bankruptcy Act. That is false and is known to be false. It was claimed by the honourable gentleman that $106,000, which was to be paid under a deed that I had signed but which had nothing to do with the Bankruptcy Act, had not, in fact, been paid. That is untrue and is known to be untrue. An amount of $80,000-odd of it was paid in cash. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I do. The honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Baume)</inline> has just said that I made misleading statements to the House on a number of matters. He said that I had made the accusation that he had taken advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. I made this statement and explained it on the basis that the honourable gentleman had entered in to a deed of arrangement, which I say it is. Clause 9 of the deed of arrangement of the creditors referred to his deed. They are interdependent. I referred also to the authority executed under section 188 of the Bankruptcy Act. To that extent I reiterate what I have said. I said also that creditors had informed me - </para>

            <para class="block">Trade Union Movement, where this action has no relation to industrial disputes &#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In moving this motion I would like to preface my remarks by making clear the position from which I speak. I do not speak to denigrate in any way trade unions or trade unionism. I am not involved in what is called a &#39;union bash&#39;. I have respect for the trade unions as an institution integral to our free society and as bodies that protect ordinary citizens of this country in many aspects of their work situation. I am aware also of the historical contribution made by the trade union movement to the development of Australia. I speak, however, to draw attention to the activities of some individuals within trade unions who bring disrepute on the union movement and whose activities, if they continue, can only adversely affect our community. </para>
          <para>An election for the House of Representatives is due to be held in 1978 or 1979. At that time the citizens of Australia again will be asked to decide who should govern the nation. At that time I believe it important for the electors of Australia also to be asked whether they approve of political strikes and work bans. This is becoming a vital issue because no matter which party is in power, no matter which group has been elected via the political process, there are some groups in our society holding key positions who are determined to make political decisions on behalf of the whole community without reference to and often in defiance of the parliamentary process. I refer, of course, to strikes and work bans enforced by sections of the trade union movement for political purposes. This question of political strikes is a vital one for the community and, I believe, will become more urgent if current trends continue. Over the past few years we have seen numerous politically motivated strikes and bans- the Medibank strike; bans on Indonesian shipping; bans on United States nuclearpowered warships entering our ports, in clear contravention of the ANZAAS Treaty; bans on building of roads and other structures and bans on demolition of various buildings. </para>
          <para>Some unions have so broadened the scope of their activities that the stage has been reached where there is virtually no area of political, social or econmic life upon which they are not prepared to take direct action in support of their aims and views. This is not to say that I believe it is wrong for unions to express views on matters affecting society or on the actions of government. In a liberal democracy this is a legitimate course of action for all groups and all individuals. As a member of this Parliament I have met with trade union representatives and discussed their views on various economic and industrial matters. But it is one thing to tender advice and seek to influence government policy; it is quite another to attempt to impose decisions on governments and on the community. It is the latter phenomenon we have been seeing repeatedly in recent years. I can understand unions or individual unionists refusing to carry out some particular work on the grounds that they morally object to it and could not be a party to it. There are parallels in the medical profession, for instance, where some doctors or nurses will not take part in certain medical operations. One might think this reasonable. I do not advocate forcing people to perform work they find morally abhorrent. However, it is one thing for a person to say: &#39;I will not carry out this task&#39; but completely different for a person to say: &#39;I will not carry out this task and nor shall anyone else&#39;. This is essentially how some militant unions operate. They not only withdraw their own labour but also, through threats, intimidation and arranging boycotts from other unions, ensure that others are unable to exercise freely their right to supply their own labour. </para>
          <para>The cost to the community of political strikes can be enormous. I give but 2 examples: The bans on the construction of Melbourne&#39;s Newport power station have delayed for years the building of this vital component of Melbourne&#39;s future electricity supply. Some unionists still wish to prevent it being built and to prevent others from doing so. The prospect of future power shortages in Melbourne is looming. There can be no doubt that the jobs of many will be affected. Yet this group of union militants considers it has the right to block the decision of the Government overwhelmingly elected by the people of Victoria. Another example of a political work ban is the question of the shipment of wheat to Chile. The union ban on wheat sales to Chile was imposed in 1973 because of the overthrow of the communist government in Chile. The ban is blatantly political. Before the union ban, Chile ranked high among Australia&#39;s wheat customers. In the 3 years from 1971 to 1974 Chile bought almost l.S million tonnes of Australian wheat. It was our fourth largest customer in 1971-72, but since 1973-74 we have sold no wheat to Chile. This was action that can only adversely affect our farmers, and frankly I cannot see how it assists the people of Chile. </para>
          <para>If I might digress for a moment, I marvel at the selective conscience of some unions. One wonders why there is not a ban on wheat sales and other export to the Soviet Union- a nation notorious for its suppression of human rights, for locking up dissidents in psychiatric hospitals and harassment of ethnic groups. I believe this inconsistency gives a clear indication of the political motives of such militant unionists. On the question of wheat sales to Chile, former Australian Labor Party Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is a matter for the government of the day to make a judgment as to whether Australia continues to trade with a country, and on what basis. I do not think it is the role of any group in the community to make decisions of the nature of these loading bans. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree with that. The principle inherent is clear. It is the Parliament, the body elected directly by the people of Australia, that should make decisions relating to the Government of the nation, not groups of unionists. It is abhorrent that such small groups have the ability to obstruct government decision making. It is abhorrent that we are confronted with groups not merely expressing their views on some issues but, through their ability to create chaos and to disrupt the community, attempting to impose their views on government. On the whole those who have supported these political strikes have shown themselves to be the enemies of democratic processes. Communist influence in many of our biggest and most important unions is strong. These people have no desire to make the present democratic system work. Their aim is to destroy it. The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, Australia&#39;s largest union, has several communists in critical posts. The seamen, waterside workers, locomotive enginemen, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association, the building workers and building labourers also have communists in senior positions in their unions. </para>
          <para>With this in mind it is interesting to examine the justification given for political strikes. We are told that political strikes are carried out on behalf of the community, because the Parliament does not really represent the people. It is claimed that direct action is needed to make the so called voice of the people&#39; heard. It is sheer nonsense to claim that the interest of the community in general is best served through a process of extraparliamentary action. It is nonsense to claim that the union movement is more representative than the Parliament. It should not be overlooked that trade union membership makes up only 20 per cent of the population, less than 60 per cent of the workforce and only a third of the voting public. The falsity of the claim of the union militants is further exposed when one sees that many unions have expressed their opposition to political strikes. For instance, the Tasmanian branch of the Shop Assistants Union stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Unions have a traditional industrial role and the strike weapon should not be used for political purposes and issues . . . Redress is in the ballot box at periodic elections. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Federated Clerks Union stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Political strikes constitute an attack on both the institution of trade unions as well as the democratic method of government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree strongly with those sentiments. Further it is interesting to note that the Morgan gallup poll taken last year indicated that 75 per cent of people are opposed to political strikes. Even a l arge majority of ALP supporters believed them to be unjustified. And of course, as I pointed out, there is also a large section of the union movement opposed to this sort of action. In spite of all this, the extreme radical minority persists in its claim of representing the people. It continues its attempts to intimidate elected governments, allegedly on behalf of the people. </para>
          <para>Given the ability of the extremists to create chaos and the importance of this issue to the future of this society, it is my belief that their claim should be put to rest once and for all. The only way that this can be done is simply by consulting the people the militants claim to represent. At the same time as the next election for the House of Representatives a referendum should be held on the question. All citizens would then be given a clear opportunity to give their opinion on whether these political strikes are justified, on whether they feel that the Parliament or the union militants really represent them, on whether political strikes and work bans are justified. </para>
          <para>The holding of referendums has a long history in democracies. Issues of great importance often have been put to the people directly. In the United States of America some 2 1 of its 50 States have provision for referendums. In the largest State, California, at the last State elections some 15 questions were put to the vote. Similarly a referendum was held in the United Kingdom on the question of joining the European Economic Community- a matter of great importance. In Australia, constitutional questions are put directly to the people, as was the question of conscription during the First World War. Some might claim that the holding of a referendum is an abdication of the responsibility of parliament, of the principles of representative government. However, it is the representative nature of parliament that is being challenged by the militants. It is a question of confidence in the parliamentary process. This question must be put directly to the people. </para>
          <para>I turn to the question of the value of holding a referendum. Many here might endorse my remarks about political strikes yet doubt the value of putting this question directly to the people. It is my belief that a referendum would b e of value in many respects. In making these remarks I take it for granted that Australians would vote overwhelmingly against political strikes. Firstly, it would once and for all remove all pretence that the militants are working on behalf of the people. It would remove all moral justification for their actions. If they persist they and their ideology would be discredited in the eyes of the public. As these strikes in some instances are part of a political process partly aimed at gaining public support this would act as a brake on their actions. </para>
          <para>Secondly, one needs to examine the position of the moderate union officer. Moderates are aware that their unions can exercise political power, even if they believe it incorrect to use the power in this direction. They are constantly being urged to use their union&#39;s potential political leverage even if this disrupts the community. A clear decision by the people in a referendum on this issue would be a powerful propaganda weapon for the moderate to use against militants in defence of his position. He could hardly be accused of selling out the people&#39;s interests in refusing to participate in a political strike if the people had clearly shown that they did not approve of such behaviour. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, a referendum expressing the desires of the people could be of use as a guideline for industrial courts when disciplinary actions are brought against unions. When the case is put, for example, to deregister a union, the court when considering the record of the union in political strikes could be guided by the views expressed in such a referendum. Deregistration of a union is a powerful weapon if there is another organisation ready to fill the gap thus created. In short, I believe there is good reason to believe that a referendum is of value to the community. </para>

              <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I pointed out to the House the great dangers to the community represented by political strikes. I made it quite clear that I was in no way opposed to unions or to strike action in pursuit of legitimate industrial interests. I have advocated that there be a referendum on political strikes for 3 reasons and in the confident belief that at such a referendum the desirability of political strikes would be overwhelmingly rejected by the Australian people. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The first of the 3 reasons that I put forward in favour of the holding of such a referendum is that it would destroy for ever the pretence that these political strikes are conducted in the interests of the community. That is something that the community should be able to decide for itself. Secondly, it would strengthen the moderate unionists in their opposition to this type of strike action in pursuit of political objectives. Thirdly, it would encourage the industrial courts to take appropriate action against unionists and union leaders who abuse their power to impose political disabilities on the community. </para>
          <para>The issue of political strikes and work bans is one that Australia will face more and more this decade. We cannot ignore it in the forlorn hope that it will go away. It must be faced. A referendum must be held. That would no doubt strengthen community resolve on this matter before it reaches crisis point. </para>
          <para>History is studded with instances of the exercise of power outside the established process of government leading to the development of authoritarian rule. What our society and this Parliament face at the present time is an exercise in freedom of action which in the long run will lead to the destruction of the system upon which that freedom of action is based. Winston Churchill once said that our system of parliamentary democracy is the worst possible form of governmentexcept for all the alternatives. And government by union militants is a very much worse alternative. A referendum on this subject would help to strengthen this Parliament and the community. It is a step that must be taken to defend our liberal democratic institutions. </para>

            <para>- It is a pity that the valuable time of this Parliament has been taken up with such a trivial matter as that which the honourable member for Isascs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hamer)</inline> has brought forward. He knows as well as every other member of this House that the proposal to hold referendums is a dereliction of his duty and the duty of the Government, which was elected to govern. It is not unusual for the inept, incompetent Government that we have to come forward with such a proposition. I concede that it is being put forward not by the Government but by a Government supporter. It follows axiomatically that if people support such an inept, incompetent Government then it must be their attitude towards things generally. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member for Isaacs must know, as I and every other member of this House know and as the people of Australia know, that 28 questions have been put to the people of Australia since Federation and that only five of those questions have been carried. In other words, on 23 occasions the people of Australia have said No. So he is standing on very safe ground in putting this matter forward as a referendum proposal because he knows that the answer to it by the people of Australia would be a resounding No. He has invited that answer by the way in which he has phrased his question. If the honourable gentleman is sincere and really wants to test it in this way, I invite him to rephrase his question so that the answer to it would bring a Yes vote from the people of Australia and see how far he then goes. He knows that this proposal is a ploy. He is smiling smugly. He knows very well that it is just a bit of window dressing. It is an opportunity for him and the fellow union bashers who sit with him to stand up and use the old, tired, worn-out phrases about political strikes, militant unions and communist union secretaries and to ignore all the time the fact that union leaders are elected by union members and, I might add, are elected to act in the best interests of those members, and without exception that is the case in Australia. The honourable member likes to use nice, flowery phrases, such as &#39;political strikes &#39;. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Isaacs instanced the Medibank strike. I have been a member of a union for some 38 years and I have worked in industry for about that long. In all of that time the wages that I took home at the end of each week to my darling wife, who then had to dole that money out amongst the butcher, the grocer, the rent collector and the rest, were of prime concern to me. As to the Medibank issue, if I were back on the job and my wages were being reduced by $5, $6 or more a week because of the Medibank levy it would surely be a matter of concern to me. The fact that I was taking home less money under a Liberal-National Country Party Government that had promised me more before the elections would be a matter of concern to me. How does the honourable member equate that with a political strike? He listens to the scabs, pimps and free-loaders who refuse to be involved in that sort of situation and comes forward in this House and tries to canonise those people. </para>
          <para>It seems, as I am continually being told by honourable members opposite, that we live in a free enterprise system. However, I find nothing free or enterprising about it. It is neither free nor enterprising; it is not even private. The free enterprise system is motivated by profit. There would not be an honourable member opposite who would not agree with me when I say that the prime motivation behind the free enterprise system is profit. People be damned; but profit must stand inviolate. Under those circumstances we will have people in powerful positions, such as magnates of corporations, taking decisions that may not be in the best interests of the community as a whole. This Government, by its very actions, will support those decisions and anybody who dares to stand up and oppose them will be labelled an extremist, a communist or some other dirty noun that the Government can wrap its tongue around. I am putting to the House that there is no need to defend the integrity of the union movement and the unionists in Australia. Their integrity is beyond reproach. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Isaacs also mentioned the entry of nuclear warships into certain ports. I assume he meant the port of Sydney, which refused entry to a nuclear warship. Why does he not explain to us that the people who wished to bring the American nuclear warship here had not been able to give the Premier of New South Wales or anybody else for that matter any guarantees that the city of Sydney and the port of Sydney would be safe in the case of accidents. I understand that the honourable gentleman spent some considerable time in the Royal Australian Navy. As such he would know that ships and other vehicles are prone to accident on occasions. The Liberal-National Country Party Government of Australia in Canberra was quite prepared to put all of the people of Sydney- some 2 million of them- at risk and allow this ship to enter the port. It was the responsible, intelligent, sensible trade unionists and, I might add, the Labor Government of New South Wales that refused the ship entry to the port of Sydney. Anybody who claims that action is irresponsible must himself be irresponsible. This House and, through it, the people of the nation will judge where the irresponsibility lies. </para>
          <para>The tearing down of homes at a time when there is already a housing shortage in Australia in order to build roads that will soon become congested and clogged and lead to other evil things is opposed by trade unionists and they are taking positive action on this issue. Are they to be condemned for doing that? Some monuments, some relics from our past, which are part of our heritage still stand. They did not go under the wrecker&#39;s hammer. They did not finish as a pile of rubble, simply because responsible people, trade unionists, stood in the way of those who for profit would tear down these parts of our heritage. Are these acts by unionists irresponsible? Are they acts which honourable members opposite would condemn? Do honourable members opposite really mean what they say or do they speak with their tongue in their cheek, building up to a bigger campaign? </para>
          <para>There is the whole question of uranium. It has already been dealt with in Queensland by railway workers there and will be dealt with by other workers if those sitting on the other side of this House think that it is simply a matter of mining and selling uranium with profit as the motive and saying: The people be damned&#39;. This is the attitude of those who sit opposite. It is the attitude of those who pay their bills to get them into this place as a government and keep them here. As an aside, it was interesting to read an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today which shows that $lm belonging to the Liberal Party in Victoria is invested in finance companies. The Liberal Government in Victoria manages the State Savings Bank. Who is it that prevents the State Savings Bank from engaging in hire purchase activities in Victoria? It is the Liberal Government. That is the moral attitude of these people. They are no different here from what they are in Victoria or in any other State when we have this combined assault upon people who take action to preserve things that they would destroy. They are the wreckers, not the unions, not the members of the unions. </para>
          <para>They bleat about there being no democracy in trade unions. Has an example of no democracy in unions ever been placed before this House? Honourable members opposite talk about domination of the rank and file members of unions by their leadership. Has there been any evidence of this brought forward? They are phrases that are used to try to discredit something that those opposite fear. The reason that people hate is that they are afraid. Those who sit opposite hate and never miss an opportunity to bash the unions. Why do they fear the unions? They think that by winning a popularity poll at election time it leaves them with the sole responsibility of managing this country. They are not doing that very well if one of their members is talking about governing by referendum. They do not have a sole right. I can point to many governments in Australia, particularly the Government of Queensland. The Queensland Government was elected by a popular vote of 29 per cent of the people. It does not represent the other 71 per cent of the people. Who is to protect the interests of the people under those circumstances? One must look forward to the trade union movement doing a most responsible job in this area. </para>

              <para>-That defies answer. The whole exercise brought forward by the honourable member for Isaacs was a sham. It was thrown out as a smokescreen. It was put up so he could deliver another virulent attack on what he believes to be the enemy of this country, but he cannot get many people to agree with him. He mentioned a gallup poll that does not reflect opinions accurately. Gallup polls, like his referendum question, will get the answer they invite. The honourable member spoke about industrial and political disputes. He should go to the <inline font-style="italic">Year Book</inline> and check the record. He could find that in 1973- the first book I grabbed was the 1973 one, but one year is no different from the next- out of 2300 strikes 145 were about something other than wages, hours of work, leave, pensions and compensation provisions, managerial policy, physical working conditions and trade unionism. Yet the honourable gentleman would have this House believe that all strikes that take place in Australia are irresponsible, have nothing to do with wages and have nothing to do with working conditions. Would he drive men to work when working conditions were unsafe? Would he drive them to work on the Westgate Bridge in Melbourne, which collapsed and killed many workmen? Would he be one of those simply because trade unionists exercised their right to withdraw their labour when they did not feel it was safe to work? It is quite clear from the attitude of those opposite that that is the sort of thing they would do. There is legislation before the House now which will endeavour to do that sort of thing. </para>

            <para>-by leave-By the authority vested in it by resolutions of both Houses of the Parliament, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is empowered to investigate and report on matters referred to it by either House, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Defence, and it may initiate its own references. It also has the power to appoint sub-committees to conduct investigations. In the reconstitution of the Committee in March 1976, the Committee decided to appoint 3 subcommittees to investigate a number of matters upon which it considered it important that the Parliament should be informed. The Committee believes that it is appropriate that the House should be informed of the activities of the Committee and its sub-committees. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The main Committee itself has met regularly and has been briefed on a number of important matters regarding both foreign affairs and defence. The sub-committees have been given references initiated from within the Committee. The reference of sub-committee A is Australia&#39;s territorial boundaries, including such aspects as the law of the sea and Antarctica. This subcommittee has completed its initial report, which dealt with the territorial boundary between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait area, and this was presented to Parliament on 9 December 1976. This sub-committee is continuing its charter by initiating further investigations into the broader aspects of Australia&#39;s territorial boundaries, including Antarctica and the exclusive economic zone. </para>
          <para>The reference to sub-committee B was to investigate the domestic crisis in Lebanon and its significance to the Middle East situation. Because of the hostilities existing at the time in Lebanon the Committee gave priority to investigating humanitarian aspects of the Lebanon crisis, and a report was presented to Parliament on 2 December 1976. The sub-committee is continuing its work in the wider field of the significance of the fragile Middle East situation and has submitted its draft report to the full Committee, which has fully endorsed the report. It will be p resented to Parliament during the current par- liamentary sittings. </para>
          <para>Sub-committee C was authorised to investigate the question of industrial support for defence needs as seen by the full Committee and is drawing to the end of its inquiry. It is hoped that the report from this sub-committee may be available during the current period of sittings. The House can rest assured that the Committee and its sub-committees are conscientiously fulfilling the tasks the Parliament intended for them. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>might I ask that copies of my second reading speech be distributed now so that those very assiduous members behind me may have an opportunity to read it at the same time as I do. In this general context, might I say that we would hope that it is possible in the normal course when ministerial statements or second reading speeches are made for the procedures of the House to be modified so that the speech can be distributed at the time the Minister at the table commences instead of after he has concluded. I wonder whether arrangements could be made to that end. </para>
          <para>This Bill provides for the raising of loan moneys amounting to $3m for war service land settlement in the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. It has been the Government&#39;s custom to introduce a fresh Bill each year or so to seek parliamentary approval for these funds. It is anticipated that the borrowing authority provided by the existing Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Act will be exhausted by 30 June 1977 and accordingly a further $3m is sought. As honourable members are aware, the Commonwealth is responsible for the provision of the whole of the capital moneys required for the Scheme in these 3 States. The money will, of course, be appropriated in the annual Budget in the ordinary way and the year&#39;s appropriation will represent the sum of the requirements of the 3 States concerned for these particular purposes. At the present time, South Australia requires about half of the year&#39;s appropriation, Western Australia about onethird and Tasmania the balance. </para>
          <para>As has been stated in previous years when similar Bills were introduced to Parliament, the bulk of this money is required to make advances to settlers to provide adequate working capital to cover current working expenses, the purchase of stock, and capital funds for replacement of plant. </para>
          <para class="block">A very small allocation-$10,000-may be required to meet costs, classified broadly as development, relating to fees expected to be incurred in finalising some surveys and in a drainage study in progress at Loxton in South Australia. Settlers were not required to possess capital resources of their own as a condition of entry to the War Service Land Settlement Scheme. Because of this, their ability to withstand the effects of adverse seasonal conditions or the severe cost-price squeeze to which some have been exposed, by the accumulation of financial reserves and working capital, is greatly reduced. The great majority of settlers are, in fact, viable. However, much publicity has been given to the plight of a small number of settlers on Kangaroo Island who are in financial difficulties and who are non-viable. However, they are the exception. The Government is introducing this legislation for the purpose of assisting those settlers in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania considered viable but suffering from the disabilities outlined above. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill has two purposes- to amend the National Roads Act and the Roads Grants Act by providing an additional $3.2m Commonwealth financial assistance to the State of Western Australia for road works in the current financial year; and to amend these two Acts and the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and the Transport (Planning and Research) Act by making provision for State expenditure on payroll tax to be eligible funding under each of these Acts. The proposed increase in financial assistance to Western Australia is necessary to ensure that no State receives less financial assistance for roads than in the previous year. The extra amount of $3.2m will bring the total road funds allocated to Western Australia for the year 1976-77 to $5 8.8m, this being the amount received by that State in 1975-76. </para>
          <para>Consequent upon this Bill the National Roads Act and Roads Grants Act will provide for a total allocation to the States in 1976-77 of $436.7m after allowing for the additional funds provided for in the Bill. As honourable gentlemen are aware, the Government has consistently acted to ensure that the needs of local government are provided for and the proposed allocations, adopted after consultation with the State Government, will assist local government by providing funds for the improvement of the rural road system in Western Australia. The House will be aware that there have been a number of queries regarding the eligibility of payroll tax as State funding under these Acts and the Government has decided to clarify the situation by the proposed amendment. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the Bill, which comprises 4 Parts. Part I sets out the usual preliminary information; Part II, Clause 3 to Clause 6, relates to the National Roads Act; Part III, Clause 7 to Clause 1 1, relates to the Roads Grants Act, and Part IV, Clause 12, to the payroll tax provisions. The allocations to the different road categories are set out in the detailed schedules included in clause 6 in respect of national roads and export roads and in clause 1 1 in respect of categories for the Roads Grants Act categories. The Bill provides for the additional amount set out in the schedules to be added to the 1976-77 appropriations. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $A133.76m towards the fifth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association, or IDA as it is commonly called. The IDA, established in 1960, is an affiliate of the World Bank which assists its poorest member countries by providing long term interest-free credits for sound development projects, utilising grant funds provided by its developed member countries. The IDA is by far the largest and most effective concessional lending institution in the world today. It has approved development credits totalling more than $US 1 1 billion for all the major sectors of economic development, with special emphasis on agriculture and transportation as well as projects for education, urbanization, industry, population and nutrition, tourism, telecommunications and electric power. </para>
          <para>Starting with initial subscriptions made in 1960 and thereafter, together with 4 subsequent replenishments of its resources, IDA has been provided with a total of some SUS12 billion for lending to the poorest developing countries. The resources of the Association are replenished every 3 years. The fourth replenishment totalled SUS4.5 billion to cover commitments over the 3 years period ending 30 June 1977. Since IDA resources will be fully committed by 30 June 1977, additional resources are required to cover lending operations after that date. </para>
          <para>Following protracted negotiations on a fifth replenishment, which commenced almost 18 months ago, member countries decided, having regard to the needs of the poorest countries, that they should provide a substantial increase in IDA resources compared with the level they had contributed to the fourth replenishment. The traditional donors of the IDA agreed, subject to parliamentary approval in the various countries concerned, to provide an amount for the fifth replenishment equivalent to SUS7.2 billion. In addition, a number of countries intended to contribute resources to IDA for the first time. These countries are Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea. Kuwait, a traditional donor, apart from its share in the SUS7.2 billion total, has agreed to make an extra contribution. These contributions to IDA by the oil surplus producing countries and Korea are a welcome development. I ask leave of the House to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which sets out the prospective contributions to be made to IDA under the fifth replenishment. </para>

              <para>-Honourable members will observe from this table that the total replenishment has been set at SUS7.64 billion. This will furnish IDA with a substantial increase in its resources in real terms compared with the previous replenishment, to meet its requirements for a further 3 year period. The amounts specified are payable in the national currency of each member country up to the equivalent of the amounts in United States dollars shown, and fixed in terms of the exchange rate applying on 14 March 1977, when agreement was reached among donor countries. Thus our obligation is fixed in terms of Australian dollars and is not subject to adjustment due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Australia&#39;s share of 146.90 million United States dollars is equivalent to 133.76 million Australian dollars. This represents a share of 2.04 per cent of the SUS7.2 billion target for traditional donors and is equivalent to Australia&#39;s share in the fourth replenishment. Most other donors maintained their percentage shares in this way. In absolute terms, our contribution of $A133.76m represents a very substantial increase on the amount of $A60.81m which Australia provided under the fourth replenishment. </para>

          <para>Australia again has the option of paying its contribution either in cash or by lodging nonnegotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes encashable on demand as and when funds are actually required by the International </para>
          <para class="block">Development Association for loan disbursements. In accordance with past practice and in line with the practices of most other members of the IDA, we propose to lodge promissory notes. This will spread the impact on the Budget over a number of years. Small encashments are expected to be made in 1977-78 with the bulk of the encashments taking place in each of the following four to five years. </para>
          <para>During the discussions on the level of the fifth replenishment it was agreed that essentially the same voting power arrangements which were made under the fourth replenishment should continue to apply. Accordingly, although contributions to replenishments as opposed to the original subscriptions to the IDA, do not carry voting rights, a small proportion of donors&#39; contributions is counted as a subscription. This is designed to ensure that the relative voting power of each of the developed member countries of IDA can continue broadly to correspond to its relative share of total resources contributed by these countries. Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available under the fifth replenishment, an amount of only $A2 12,416 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting rights. The balance will represent an additional contribution. This distinction is provided for in clause 4 of the Bill. </para>
          <para>I should also mention that the agreement governing the fifth replenishment will not become effective and the obligation to contribute new resources to IDA will not become binding on any member country unless and until members, whose contributions total not less than $US6 billion or 80 per cent of the total, give IDA formal notification that they will make the contributions authorised for them. Because the contribution for the United States is SUS2.4 billion or more than 30 per cent of the total, this means, in effect, that the fifth replenishment cannot become effective and other countries will not be required to contribute to IDA without formal notification from the United States to the IDA that it has taken all the necessary legislative steps to enable it to participate on the basis of the agreement reached for the fifth replenishment. </para>
          <para>It had been hoped that the fifth replenishment would become effective by 1 July 1977 when funds provided under the fourth replenishment will have been fully committed. It seems clear that the United States will not be able to give the formal notification required by that date. In order to enable the IDA to continue its lending operations in the interim other donors have been asked, and have generally agreed, to make voluntary advance contributions on a collective basis totalling not less than $ US 1.2 billion to IDA, in anticipation of the conditions of effectiveness for the agreement being fulfilled and to cover lending operations for a substantial part of 1977-78. Such voluntary advance contributions would of course be deemed ultimately to constitute payment towards the amounts due under the fifth replenishment. Similar delays have occurred under previous replenishments and Australia has made voluntary contributions in the past. In accordance with past practice the Bill has been drafted in a way which will enable Australia to join most other donors in making an advance contribution to IDA. </para>
          <para>As honourable members will know, Australia has always been a strong supporter of the IDA and has been a member since its inception. IDA like the World Bank is an efficient institution which is capable of undertaking large scale projects in a technically proficient way. Although its credits are interest free, the projects which it finances are subject to the same rigorous standards of appraisal that the World Bank applies to its own lending operations. Indeed, the 2 institutions have a common staff and are served by the same Executive Board. IDA has been of particular benefit to countries in the Asian region. Since the inception of IDA about two-thirds of all IDA credits have gone to countries in Asia, particularly the Indian sub-continent, and Asian countries will continue to receive the greater share of IDA funds. IDA has also lent relatively large amounts to Papua New Guinea and that country is expected to receive further credits in future. </para>
          <para>Considerable importance has been attached in the various major international fora to an early and substantial replenishment of IDA resources. Continued Australian support for the IDA is therefore clearly in Australia&#39;s national interest. This Bill provides an opportunity for honourable members once again to demonstrate their bipartisan support for the IDA as an efficient and effective development finance institution and our willingness to provide the poorest developing countries with highly concessional assistance through this organisation. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise an initial Australian Government contribution of $A8m, to be paid initially in the form of promissory notes, to the International Fund for Agricultural Development- IFAD- as well as to approve Australia&#39;s membership of the Fund. As honourable members may know, the decision to set up the International Fund for Agricultural Development was one of the major initiatives taken at the 1974 World Food Conference in Rome. Australia was one of 3 developed countries, together with the Netherlands and New Zealand, which with 3 1 developing countries cosponsored Resolution XIII of the World Food Conference which recommended the establishment of such a Fund. The Secretary-General of the United Nations subsequently convened a conference to work out the details and size of the Fund. Following meetings of interested countries in May and October of 1975 and in February 1976, the terms of the Agreement for the establishment of the Fund were finalised at a plenipotentiary conference on 13 June of last year. The text of the Agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Bill. However, the Agreement was not opened for signature before prospective contributors to the Fund had made pledges amounting to an aggregate of $US 1,000m. This was achieved in December 1976, and the Agreement was opened for signature at the United Nations on 20 December 1976. To date 40 countries have signed the Agreement and six have ratified it. Australia signed the Agreement on 30 March 1977. </para>
          <para>Membership of the Fund is divided into 3 categories. Category I comprises members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Category II the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Category III other developing countries. The Agreement will enter into force upon ratification by 6 States in Category I, 6 States in Category II and 24 States in Category III and when the aggregate of initial contributions amounts to at least the equivalent of $US750m. </para>
          <para>The principal objective of the Fund is to make available finance ibr agricultural development projects. More specifically, the broad aims of IFAD include the encouragement of agricultural development in low income countries, with particular emphasis on food production in those countries which have the most serious food deficits; the encouragement of greater utilisation of the potential for food production in other developing countries; the improvement of the living conditions of the rural poor through activities which will increase their opportunities and incomes; and a reduction in malnutrition through the improvement in food production and distribution systems. The Fund will become a new Specialised Agency of the United Nations. </para>
          <para>One of the important features of the International Fund for Agricultural Development is that it will tap not only the traditional aid resources of the OECD countries, but also the substantial resources of the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC countries and the OECD countries are making roughly equivalent total contributions to the Fund. The Government warmly welcomes participation by the OPEC countries in a co-operative venture of this nature with the developed West. Australia played a significant role in the establishment of IFAD and has, as a prospective member, pledged an initial contribution of $A8m in the form of non-negotiable noninterest bearing promissory notes encashable over a period of not less than 3 years. This compares with pledges by the United States of America of $US200m, the United Kingdom of stg15m, Canada $C30m and New Zealand $NZ2m. Amongst the pledges of the OPEC countries are Saudi Arabia &#39;s pledge of $US 1 00m and Iran&#39;s pledge of $US 104m. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that the International Fund for Agricultural Development has an important role to play as a new source of investment for projects designed to increase food production in developing countries. The Fund accords with one of our chief aid priorities of providing the impetus for developing countries to help themselves to achieve self-reliance in food production. It is particularly appropriate that a major primary producing country such as Australia should play an active role in an organisation of this nature. Furthermore, it is likely that, as IFAD gets under way, there will be commercial opportunities for Austraiian agricultural machinery, technology and expertise in connection with IFAD projects. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations already looks to Australia for significant contributions in such specialised areas as dryland farming and pastoral land use in arid zone Middle Eastern countries. IFAD can be expected to continue, and to expand on, this pattern. </para>
          <para>The principal obligations imposed on Australia are stated in Articles 4 and S of the Agreement. Under section 3 of Article 4, the Governing Council of IFAD may invite Australia to make contributions to the resources of the Fund additional to its initial contribution. The major rights Australia will enjoy under the Agreement are those stated in Article 6 concerning the organisation and management of the Fund. Australia is entitled to be represented on the Governing Council and to appoint one Governor and an alternate to the Council which will conduct the business of the Fund. I believe that it is in both Australia&#39;s national interest and in the interest of the international community as a whole, that we should play an active part in the International Fund for Agricultural Development by contributing $8m to the Fund and ratifying the Agreement establishing the Fund. I commend this Bill to honourable members. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of debate. I suggest therefore that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed in this debate. </para>

            <para>- The 2 Bills we are discussing in this cognate debate are related because we are dealing with what is called administrative law. There is not a great deal of precedent for administrative law. At the outset I want to say that the Opposition welcomes and supports the Bills. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created in the time of the previous Labor Government and it gives an opportunity for citizens to establish their rights as against administrative decisions. We think that is a very important democratic way of saying that the Parliament itself is not going to be supreme in all of its actions and where there are administrative determinations and decisions, as there have to be in the normal course of events, rights will be given to people in certain circumstances to say as citizens that they object to those determinations and decisions. There has to be an opportunity for these views to be looked at impartially. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We note with interest that plans are well advanced to enable appeals to be taken to the Tribunal under the Social Services Act. Appeals will also be provided in the future under a large number of Australian Capital Territory ordinances. We concur with the Government s belief that the Tribunal has a very important role to play. The Tribunal&#39;s work is expected to increase substantially not because in all cases administrative decisions are wrong but because it ought to be expected that there will be a number of queries as to whether in fact they are right. </para>
          <para>The Tribunal is to be constituted in a number of different ways. We note that the legislation proposes to create the class of senior nonpresidential member. Instead of the Tribunal having a constitution that requires that there be a presidential member and 2 non-presidential members this Bill proposes that the opportunity be given for the Tribunal to be constituted in any number of 4 ways. There can be a presidential tribunal, a non-presidential tribunal, a presidential tribunal comprising a president plus 2 nonpresidential members and a tribunal of a senior non-presidential member plus 2 others. </para>
          <para>I note that the legislation proposes a number of consequential amendments. Section 36 is to be amended in 3 respects. This section relates to a certificate being given by the Attorney-General which says that in certain circumstances there is a question of security and a question of public interest which must be taken into consideration. Accordingly that is a matter that has to be considered by the Tribunal. I only make this passing comment: I note that in certain circumstances the Tribunal can make that information available to some of the parties only, not to all of them. There must be good reason for this. I was wondering why the limitation applied in some cases only to some parties and not to all of them. </para>
          <para>I also note that other provisions are covered in section 43A and section 66 which could relate to unauthorised disclosure of information. As I have said, at the outset we support these matters. </para>
          <para class="block">Might I say in support of what is being put here today, not only in respect of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill but also the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill that investigation into this legislation has been the subject of detailed report. The first investigation was carried out by the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee known as the Kerr Committee. I notice that this committee reported in August 1971. 1 am not always able to give praise to my colleague, the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott),</inline> who is sitting at the table, particularly in view of some of the more recent debates that have taken place in this House. We do not always agree on matters. But the honourable gentleman was a member of that committee. I note with interest that he has been able to use his talents to introduce legislation of this type and we applaud him for it. </para>
          <para>Both of these pieces of legislation have been before the Administrative Review Council which was set up by the Attorney in accordance with the provisions of the previous Bill which was introduced by the previous Labor Government The Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Review Council were part and parcel of that legislation. The Council is made up of very well qualified members who were appointed by the Attorney. The Council includes not only representatives who are skilled in the law but also those who are skilled in the faculty of common sense, and that requirement has a lot to do with administrative law and administrative discretion. Both of these pieces of legislation have been approved by the Administrative Review Council. I join in saying that this is a very worthwhile watch dog operation. In other words, we have an impartial group that can review amendments to laws or suggest new ones. We can see that there has been a fair amount of investigation into the legislation in the first instance by the Labor Government and since by the present Government. The Kerr Committee reported on this matter and now the Administrative Review Council has also vetted the legislation and the amendments. The Committee on Administrative Discretions was established for the purpose of carrying out surveillance of the discretions that are used. The ombudsman legislation has already been introduced and in accordance with Labor Party policy an ombudsman has been appointed. The Labor Party still strongly supports that proposition because the precedent has been set throughout the world that such a person has a most important and effective role to play. Honourable members will note from reports of the Ombudsman presented in the Parliament that some 20 per cent of complaints have been deemed to be well founded. Therefore we can see again that an effective role can be provided for a number of people to look at administrative law and administrative decisions. </para>
          <para>Administrative decisions can be in accordance with the law and others may not be. This brings me to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill. On this legislation the Attorney has succinctly said there is always going to be a review of unlawful actions. At the present time we have them taken by way of prerogative writ in State courts with a number of cumbersome and technical procedures. What better way to do it than by the present suggestion- that is that the matter go to the Federal Court of Australia for judicial review. Having created a court, it has a definite function to fulfil, particularly in respect of what is deemed to be Commonwealth legislation or the legislation of an Australian Parliament A Federal Court having been created, it is the proper court to be a court of review. Honourable members will note that it is mentioned especially that the Court does not substitute decisions of its own but merely says whether decisions made are lawful or unlawful. That is the crux of the whole debate. The Bill does not create some higher authority than the Parliament. It is purely a question of whether we can say there is an avenue for people to test the decision. We also have an opportunity for reasons for decisions to be made available to people. I think that is very commendable because it gives the people in Australia, the people who create parliaments and governments, an opportunity to test the validity of those decisions. </para>
          <para>I want only to make the point again that the Opposition supports this Bill in its entirety. I understand that the Attorney-General proposes to move some amendments to either or both of the Bills. I do not know the nature of those amendments at the moment. Let me say, in summing up, that this is a very effective process which we are now supporting in this Parliament. It will give strength to the Parliament and strength to the bureaucratic decisions that must be made pursuant to laws that are passed. I want to make one point that I used to make with regard to other areas. It is that it is important that the Parliament itself does not vacate the field. There is still a role for Parliament to play and for parliamentarians to play. I can think of no better advocates for reform than parliamentarians themselves. They must not take the view that because there is an Ombudsman, an Appeals Tribunal or a Judicial Review Board that they have no role to play. I think that they have an even more important role to play. They may be anxious to discuss decisions made by the personnel of those bodies. That is their duty; that is their obligation. Adjournment speeches of course, are often made on that basis. I would like to think that some government in the future will have a look at the talent, well equipped or perhaps not so well equipped, which may be considered by a committee of the Parliament. I know that members of Parliament are often asked to make submissions to change the law that exists because of administrative decisions. It could well be, despite the ambit of these Bills, that the decision may be found to be right and yet in many cases members of Parliament could say in the course of thrust of debate: &#39;Have a look at its application in practice. Surely it was not intended when we passed this legislation that it would have these ramifications or these defects &#39;. </para>
          <para>What I would like to see is a citizens committee. It would be a committee of parliamentarians and members of Parliament would be able to go along to their colleagues and say: &#39;I want to look at a particular section of the Trade Practices Act. Look how it is affecting one of my constituents. Look how it is being interpreted. Did we really think it had that limitation or that defect?&#39; I would like to think that some time in the future governments of any colour will give support to the fact that members of Parliament are, in the main, inundated with a number of submissions as to what is wrong with legislation, either in its interpretation or in its omissions. I can cite a number of practical cases. Members of Parliament represent people and corporations who are looking after their own domestic affairs or those of their children or in the trade and commercial field. Many of them have a number of <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> complaints as to what they feel is a gap in the law or an unfair administrative decision. I think it would be a welcome addition to what is called administrative judicial review if members of Parliament also had an opportunity, through a committee constituted on a non-party basis, to say: &#39;Well, the committee is always there&#39;. Any member of Parliament who felt he had a case and wanted to put it before that committee would be entitled to do so. </para>
          <para>I think that committee could make reports to the Parliament as to how laws or administrative decisions are working in practice. There is a fair segment of administration deemed to be policy. That policy often expands and contracts with the mental capacity of the people who are administering it. It has no greater legal definition than that. The variations can be enormous. For example, in the postal and telecommunications field there are all sorts of variations, by way of interpretation, in the policy decision making which must be applied to the very many commercial transactions that flow through that field. It can be seen during question time and in debate in this Parliament that there are always queries as to ho w the policy is being interpreted, whether it has varied, or whether it is giving preference to some section of the continent against another. All of these issues come up. I would like to think that there could be a committee of the House to deal with matters and through which members of Parliament could push causes forward. </para>
          <para>I have no doubt that they would do so only on a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> basis. They would only do so on the basis that they could have with them the constituent or corporation which felt that an injustice was being done. That is another role to which I think we ought to give a lot of strength. That in no way weakens what I have said previously in the course of supporting this legislation. There are people, not in this Parliament, well qualified and well equipped to make determinations on the basis of administrative decisions. In a nutshell, the Opposition supports both these pieces of legislation and wishes them a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>-The Government must be congratulated on introducing this legislation. In the near future, when the legislation is passed, Australia will be in the forefront of democratic countries in regard to administrative appeals or reviews. The tiers that are being established include the office of Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunals, the Federal Court of Australia, with powers to deal with administrative decisions and, subsequently, the Freedom of Information Bill, which has been foreshadowed. Also there will be a Bill to set down standard procedures for Commonwealth adjudicative tribunals in Une with the recommendations of the Kerr Committee. The whole area has bedevilled society, and lawyers in particular, since the Second World War. There were problems before that time but the growth of delegated legislation, the growth of modern bureaucracies of state have produced many problems for the individual citizen. It has been necessary to seek recourse outside the ordinary processes of the law. That is not to criticise the law as such. When persons have rights that must be adjudicated upon, a court traditionally looks at the position very carefully and in great detail. That is quite proper. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil rights or the individual&#39;s freedom, the courts were to do anything other than scrutinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail the entire position, there could be miscarriages of justice. It is most important that where the freedom of the individual is concerned both sides of the case be presented in detail, that all evidence be taken at length, that all the documents that are available be looked at and that the rules of law which apply be analysed carefully and applied by the judge or the higher tribunal on appeal. Much of that procedure is not appropriate where we are dealing with modern legislation designed to assist to produce better social conditions for people or to put into operation policies of the Government where the individual rights of the person concerned are very important but where it is not necessary to go into tremendous technical detail in determining , those rights. Indeed, if too rigid an application is placed on dealing with these disputations, then the difficulties to which I have referred arise. In particular, technical rules of law can develop which shut a man out from a remedy. </para>
          <para>There have been many cases in the recent past of apparent injustice caused because the law was insufficient for the particular case. I briefly give one example that occurred in New South Wales in recent times. About four or five years ago a new scheme for the quotas to be applicable to poultry farmers was introduced in New South Wales. In many cases poultry farmers found that their activities had to be completely restructured. The legislation provided for a committee to allocate quotas but also provided for a review committee to look at these allocations. In one case that came before the courts in the recent past a farmer, a young man and his wife, had taken over a farm from his parents on the outskirts of the Sydney area. </para>
          <para>The couple found that they were entitled to a much lower quota than they were able to run because the quota was based upon the capacity at a date prior to when they took over the farm. It happened that for one year only the young man &#39;s father had taken a break from egg production and transferred to meat production. So, the egg production was reduced in that one year only. When the young man was running his own poultry farm two or three years later- his quota being assessed on the situation of his father in one year of the 20 years of his operation, that year being one or two years before- the young man found that he was given a drastically reduced quota. He applied to the review committee for a review. The legislation provided for a review committee to be set up which varied little, if at all, from the membership of another group known as the Egg Marketing Board of New South Wales. I do not make any reflection upon the Board or the review committee. </para>
          <para>The review committee made a decision and subsequently it was disbanded under the legislation. It just went out of existence. Thereafter the courts in New South Wales received a challenge to this man &#39;s quota and the courts held that there were serious doubts whether the law had been applied in the assessment of the original base quotas and in the review procedures that were conducted. However, because the quota review committee had been disbanded, nothing could be done. It was not possible for the court, even though it might have wished to do so, to make an order that there should be a revision of the quota. In fact all the quotas in New South Wales at that time had been fulfilled. So, although it was possible to see an error of law and a clear injustice the remedy was not available because as the law stood the court could not effect a remedy. </para>
          <para>I seek an assurance from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> In his second reading speech he said that appeals may be brought to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal only where the relevant Act provides for an appeal. I should like to be sure, as I hope and I am confident is the intent of the Attorney-General, that as many Acts as possible should have that provision in them. Indeed, we should search the statute book and, as a matter of course, where it is appropriate ensure that appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is available. There should only be very exceptional cases where the appeal is not available. Legislation that provides for boards to be set up to make decisions and then to be disbanded so that nothing could be done about the decision afterwards is to be avoided because it wreaks great injustice. Unless a particular Act provides for recourse to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the whole purpose of the Tribunal can come to nought. </para>
          <para>Allied to that factor, I point out with regard to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Bill it is important that theoretical situations do not come about. What concerns lawyers are cases where the courts find injustices have occurred because the law has not been complied with but nothing can be done because there is no body to whom an order can be directed. I hope that the clause in the Bill which deals with this matter is sufficiently wide. For some time I have thought that the whole law of declarations, or declaratory orders, needs a great deal of consideration. It is a confused area of law. Books are written about it. A new one appears probably every year or so. There are a tremendous number of cases on this issue of declarations- when they will be available, when they are not available and how they operate. Indeed as far as government departments are concerned, it is often up to the Government itself to accede to the declaration. Governments always do that but there may be circumstances where other bodies might in some way try to avoid the effect of a declaration. A review of the law on declarations is required to make sure that decisions that have to be made by the courts can be made and the plaintiff is not refused a right. </para>
          <para>Bear in mind also that as things stand now in the courts a person may go to the court and the court may say that he has a good case because the board acted wrongly but there is nothing the court can do about it now because the board has been dissolved. The public may be surprised to learn that almost invariably the plaintiff, having been told all that, will lose his costs and will have to pay the costs of the other people because whoever wins the action is awarded an order for costs. So, if a plaintiff brings a case against the Government because of something that an instrumentality has done and proves his point, he cannot get a remedy because the law is deficient; and he loses his costs. It is a ridiculous situation. I ask the Attorney-General to assure the House that to the greatest extent possible these Bills cover those problems. </para>
          <para>I am a little concerned about some of the provisions as to Crown privilege. I shall leave it until some time has elapsed to see how those matters work out in the interpretation by the courts. I hope that the Attorney-General will adopt the procedure of reviewing through a council or in some other way the workings of the various tiers of administrative review that he is establishing. No doubt members of Parliament will be asked at various times to contribute thoughts as to how the review should be conducted and how the system is working. If an action is brought against a government instrumentality in one of the courts or on appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and there is too great a degree of claiming of Crown privilege, in some cases that could impinge upon the rights of the individual. Often the individual is seeking to expose some act done by the government, bureau, department, committee, body or whatever it may be. He may have to subpoena its documents or obtain the minutes of the body that dealt with the case. He may have to go into the whole background of the matter. If he is unable to do that because of various claims of privilege, of course he may be unable to prove his case. </para>
          <para>Examples come to mind in which a plaintiff has commenced a case seeking judicial review of an administrative body&#39;s decision and, having issued subpoenas, shortly before the hearing, he has found on inspection of the documents that a number of matters appear in them which strengthen his case or even give him another set of headings on which to bring his case because the actions of the body concerned, not being public until then, may well have broken the law m ways that were unknown to him even when he started his action although he may have known that the body erred in some other way. I suggest that Crown privilege should be limited as much as possible to those cases where there is a genuine security problem or the more serious aspects of the need for Crown privilege. It is good that reasons should be provided. Reasons are important because one cannot even challenge a decision sensibly unless reasons are provided because one does not know the basis of the decision. A large number of amendments are proposed. I have only just received copies of the amendments and it is not possible to make detailed comment on them. They do not appear to deal with the substance of the Bills. However, I will reserve my position regarding those amendments at this time. </para>
          <para>I commend the Attorney-General for broadening the scope of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is unfortunate that so few cases have been brought before the Tribunal. Only 24 applications were made until 26 April. On the other hand, of course, it may mean that everything in the garden is rosy and there are no real problems. However, the extension of the Tribunal&#39;s jurisdiction is welcomed. Its extension to the social security area will be very welcomed by the public at large, and that would cut both ways. Persons, for example, who have a legitimate grievance because they have not received the proper rate of pension and those in these complicated areas who have found that they have been wrongly assessed as to some benefit would welcome this provision. It would take some workload off the Department and also off the members of Parliament, although we will always assist our constituents wherever possible. It might also enable all persons to be sure that such situations as appeals against the refusal of unemployment benefit will be dealt with on a comprehensive plane and all parties concerned could have confidence in the outcome. I suggest that those appeals are very appropriate matters to be placed within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. I do not know whether that is the actual intent, but it would be welcome. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>-The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill is a Bill to amend a piece of legislation for which the Labor Government takes credit. The AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> said in his second reading speech that plans are now well advanced to enable appeals to be taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the Social Services Act and that appeals will also be provided under a large number of Australian Capital Territory ordinances. The Attorney-General went on to say: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>It has become apparent that the Tribunal should have a different structure iritis to be equipped to hear appeals on a wide range of matters without making excessive demands on the services of presidential members at a judicial level. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Attorney-General then said at a later stage: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The other provisions of the Bill that require special mention are those relating to the protection of information that ought not, in the public interest, be publicly disclosed in proceedings before the Tribunal or as a result of having been produced, in confidence, to the Tribunal. Section 36 of the principal Act empowers the Attorney-General to give a certificate that the disclosure of information concerning a specified matter or the disclosure of the contents of a document would be contrary to the public interest. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Attorney-General then went on to fix the criteria for the issuing of such certificates. I indicate to the Attorney-General that more is involved than social service appeals and appeals concerning A.C.T. ordinances. What worries me- I was denied the opportunity to speak about this subject when the Insurance Amendment Bill and the Life Insurance Amendment Bill were before this chamber during its last sitting- is that appeals will he from appeals under the Insurance Act of 1973 and the Life Insurance Act of 1945. The Opposition was denied an opportunity to raise those issues on that occasion. I think that it is therefore appropriate that I should do so at this time. </para>
          <para>In my time in this Parliament, at any rate, the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act have undergone considerable structural amendment and change. They have had to be amended and changed to meet the complexity of the insurance industry. As a consequence the appeals that will now be made to the Tribunal structured under this piece of legislation will test the competency and the capabilities of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as it is now constituted. Because of the complexity of the insurance industry and the appeals that are going to lie from both general and life insurance, I question whether this is the appropriate Tribunal to deal with these sorts of appeals. I wanted to do so on the previous occasion and I now do so on this occasion. </para>
          <para>The second thing that concerns me, as I will touch on later, is the embargo on the findings of the Tribunal being made public. </para>
          <para>I understand that the jurisdiction of the Insurance Tribunal is to be transferred to this Tribunal under clause 24 of the Bill. The grounds of appeal in the Insurance Act have not been changed. An appeal lies against administrative decisions of either the Treasurer or the Commissioner for Insurance. These may be with respect to areas which are complex and demand a thorough knowledge of the industry. I wish to take the Attorney-General through sections of the Insurance Act because this will show conclusively the complexity that will weigh on the Tribunal. I still claim that the Tribunal is not structured to meet that complexity. That will take some time. The general Insurance Act gives rights of appeal to the Tribunal. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Government has taken away appeals to a tribunal established under the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act. It has now decided that appeals shall lie under this Tribunal. I am setting out to show the complexity which the Tribunal will have to face. Section 27(3) of the Act concerns an appeal against a refusal to grant an authority. Section 30 (6) concerns an appeal against a refusal to admit certain assets against a determination. Section 31 (3) provides for an appeal against the direction of the Commissioner under section 31(2). </para>

              <para>-If the Minister would be kind enough to be attentive I shall try to explain it to him. Section 31(2) of the Act provides for bodies corporate lodging financial statements every year. If this is questioned an appeal will lie to this particular Tribunal. That is a complexity within itself. Section 33 (8) concerns an appeal against a determination by the Commissioner under section 33 (3). That is, an appeal will bind the Commissioner or the Treasurer on the value of assets. In that case an appeal will lie to this </para>

          <para class="block">Tribunal. Section 36 is against the cancellation of authority to underwrite insurance. Section 41(3) applies to the apportionment of receipts. Section 46 (5) concerns the refusal to appoint or the revocation of appointment of an auditor to a particular insurance company. If the Commissioner or the Treasurer refuses that appointment, the company has the right to appeal to this Tribunal. Section 51 (2) provides for an appeal against a direction given not to deal with certain assets. I advise the Minister that that situation can become extremely complex. Section 62(3) provides for an appeal against a direction or variation of a direction. This section is not particularly important but, nonetheless, an appeal can lie from it. Section 93 (5)- a provision to which I objected when the original Bill was introduced-provides for Lloyd&#39;s or Lloyd&#39;s underwriter to show cause and by notice why Part VII of the Act should not cease to apply to Lloyd&#39;s. In short, this is a revocation. Section 105 (10) provides for an appeal against the direction or a variation of a direction given under this particular section. </para>
          <para>I have referred to the Insurance Act. Under all these sections in the Act appeals can lie to the Tribunal on 2 grounds. With regard to the Life Insurance Act new appeals by 1Tfe insurers and auditors by way of the Tribunal are granted in the following circumstances. In the case of auditors there is a ground for appeal under section 47 which concerns the refusal to approve an auditor. This is the same right as that which applies under the Insurance Act. The grounds for companies to appeal lie under section 16(1) (a) which concerns the refusal to allow a company to carry on some form of business other than life or general insurance. This is a new provision, and it could well be a contentious one. Section 19(1) concerns refusal to register a company. Section 23a refers to cancellation of registration. Section 39 (2) deals with refusal of permission to make a particular type of investment. This is a new provision, but no appeal by the life company will lie to this Tribunal. A company may appeal against a direction under section 40a to vary a statement as set out in the Act. Section 47 is the same as applies to auditors. It may appeal against rejection of a series of accounts under section 52 (3). An appeal may be made against a direction given under section 58 ( 1 ) to a company after an investigation. Reference was made m the second reading speech enabling appeals to be taken to the Tribunal under the Social Services Act and Australian Capital Territory ordinances. I wonder whether the Minister or the Department considered this point. Obviously they did in preparing the earlier Bill. I am suggesting to the Minister that because of the complexities of the industry I doubt very much whether this is the appropriate tribunal to deal with these appeals. </para>

I further asked the Minister: </para>

Decisions by the Tribunal on these matters are of public importance. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank honourable members for the way in which they have participated in the debate and for the very kind words which, at times, they have said about the Attorney-General. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> referred to the Kerr committee and to the members of that committee. As is quite clear from the attitude of the Opposition at this time the recommendations of the committee have, in effect, been adopted by the Parliament. I pay tribute to those who served on that committee, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Anthony</inline> Mason, who is now a Justice of the High Court, and Professor Harry Whitmore. I particularly mention Professor Harry Whitmore because he is a leading authority on the subject of administrative law not only in Australia but also in the rest of the world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I know from my own participation in that committee that he made a great contribution to it and, of course, to the final report. It is also a fact that he became a member of what is called the Bland committee which ultimately recommended an ombudsman and which also looked at the form which administrative appeals should take in the Commonwealth area. I take this opportunity to place on record the appreciation of the House and of successive governments of the work in this field of the persons I have mentioned. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith asked why some but not all documents which were the subject of production against the question of privilege might be shown to one party as against another. That was put in simply to recognise the fact that there could be odd occasions when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal felt that it was in the interests of justice that a particular party should have access to the documents or perhaps an intervenor who might be there should not have access to them. It was simply to provide against that eventuality that that matter was put in the Bill. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> raised some questions which I appreciate. He asked: Are we engaged in the exercise of extending the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The House will recall that when the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act was first brought into the House by the previous Government it did not have any schedules. In Opposition we took the view that schedules ought to be put into the Bill. They were ultimately inserted, by agreement, I think in the Senate. This piece of legislation was then given some teeth. Since it has been brought into operation in July last year, and indeed before that, there has been a successive consideration of Commonwealth Acts and regulations. That is still going on. The purpose is to ensure that as many discretions as possible which can be made the subject of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be included by regulation within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Another question which has arisen- and the honourable member for St George mentioned it- is a continuing review of the operation of the Tribunal. I remind the honourable member that the Administrative Review Council has been set up, as proposed in the recommendations of the Kerr Committee, to make sure that the workings of the Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and any other area of administrative law, are operating adequately. It is for that reason that we have the fortune to have a high powered and representative committee to do just that. Needless to say, the Parliament can be its own watchdog in this area, as well as the Council and, if I may say so, the AttorneyGeneral. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> raised a number of questions. The Bills to which he referred- the Life Insurance Amendment Bill and the Insurance Amendment Billwere debated in this House some weeks ago. They then went on to the Senate, and I understand they are about to become law. However, I do not think that should give the honourable member reason to be apprehensive. In fact some attempt was made in those Bills to deal with the questions he brought forward. For instance, clause 24 of the Insurance Amendment Bill, which inserts a new section 63 in the Insurance Act, provides in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In giving a direction as to the persons who are to constitute the Tribunal for the purposes of a review of a reviewable decision of the Treasurer or the Commissioner, or for the purposes of a request under sub-section 41 (2) of the <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act</inline> 197S in respect of such a decision, the  President  shall ensure that each nonpresidential member of the Tribunal as so constituted is a person who, in the opinion of the  President,  has special knowledge or skill in relation to the insurance business. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the whole purpose of a number of the amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. There is no question that the intention is to ensure that the Tribunal will have on it people appropriate to the particular task, and it is desired to have them sit in various tiers so that that sort of expertise may be available. It may be that in some, indeed many, matters the  President  will not sit. Let me say at the outset that he could not possibly sit in all matters if what is proposed comes about. For instance, if this Tribunal takes over some social security appeals, appeals under the Life Insurance Act and the Insurance Act, and repatriation appeals it would be impossible for the  President  to deal with them. As an example, I think that there are 10 000 appeals every year under the Repatriation Act That highlights the fact that the purpose of these amendments is to so structure the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that it will be adequate to the task and be able to sit in the tiers that are necessary for it to do so. I bring those matters to the attention of the honourable member for Hawker. The honourable member also raised the question of the Tribunal not being able to publish its reasons. So far as I can gather from my reading of the insurance Bills, there is nothing there to prevent the Tribunal publishing its reasons. I can see no reason at the moment why it cannot publish its decisions. There are provisions which deal with holding the proceedings in private, but at the same time there are provisions, so far as the hearing is concerned, enabling the Tribunal to loosen that and to say who can be present and so on. </para>
          <para>In concluding the second reading debate on this matter, I add that in a sense this is an historic occasion. It brings to fruition a very broadranging system of administrative law in this country. Some amendments of a technical and procedural character will be proposed, but at this stage I simply again commend the Bill to the House. I seek leave to continue the debate at a later hour this day. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I wish to inform the House of decisions the Government has taken about the organisation of the intelligence and security services in Australia. These decisions follow the Government&#39;s study of one of the reports of the Royal Commissioner on Intelligence and Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope, which he recently presented to the Governor-General. There is always difficulty in publicly discussing matters of security and intelligence. The Government however, intends to make public those parts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s reports which can be revealed without prejudice to national security. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government will also state publicly to the maximum possible extent its decisions in regard to the Royal Commissioner&#39;s recommendations. Honourable members will recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope was appointed the Royal Commissioner by the previous Government to make recommendations on intelligence and security services the nation should have available to it. This report is on that part of his terms of reference calling for a review of the machinery for ministerial and official control, direction, and co-ordination of the activity of the various services. The report also deals with the arrangements for the assessment of intelligence. </para>
          <para>I now table an abridgement of the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commissioner in respect of these aspects. The abridgement has been prepared by the Royal Commissioner at my request to assist in the fullest possible discussions and debate on these vital matters. We are publishing all the elements of the report the Royal Commissioner himself believes can and should be published. Honourable members will notice that the abridgement is entitled &#39;Third Report&#39;. Other reports have been presented, and the Government&#39;s decision in relation to these will be announced when consideration of them has been completed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope has advised me that the decisions I shall announce will not pre-empt recommendations in the other reports. </para>
          <para>The fundamental finding of the Royal Commissioner is that Australia needs a highly professional system of intelligence and security services, and that this need is now more apparent than ever before. Other important findings of the Royal Commissioner are: Australia needs intelligence of quality, timeliness and relevance. Intelligence is increasingly relevant to the formation of national policies in a number of areas and this is a trend that will continue. We must have our own information, our own intelligence, in order to maintain the necessary degree of selfreliance in our international posture. The Australian intelligence community is fragmented, poorly co-ordinated and organised. The process of intelligence assessment must be objective and seen to be objective. The Commission&#39;s findings affirm the growing importance of intelligence and security services. </para>
          <para>The Commission also finds, however, that these services have not occupied an appropriate place within the machinery of government and that their activities have not been well enough co-ordinated. Accordingly, the Government has decided that there should be a special committee of Ministers comprising the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Leader of the House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General to set overall policy and oversee the work of the intelligence community. The </para>
          <para class="block">Ministerial Committee should be supported by a committee of Permanent Heads, comprising Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as Chairman, Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Secretary of the Department of Defence, Chief of Defence Force Staff, Secretary to the Treasury, Director-General of Office of National Assessments and the DirectorGeneral of Security. The Committee of Permanent Heads&#39; principal function would be to advise the ministerial committee on matters of concern to it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Hope&#39;s report makes it clear that these arrangements would be in line with similar reforms which have been put into effect in many western democracies. In accepting the recommendations, the Government has expressed the ministerial committee&#39;s terms of reference more broadly than those recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope. The terms of reference of the Ministerial Committee will be &#39;to exercise policy control and managerial oversight over the national intelligence community, external and internal, in respect of targets, priorities, activities, organisational requirements, broad allocation of resources, performance and co-ordination and inter-relationships of the various agencies&#39;. These terms of reference will allow Ministers collectively to have the fullest opportunity and the responsibility of maintaining an effective and efficient intelligence community, responsive to the needs of government and the rights of citizens. </para>
          <para>A major group of findings by the Royal Commissioner relates to the organisation of the intelligence assessment arrangements. In his report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope stresses that the Government of the day should have available to it an intelligence assessments agency which can provide independent advice on a wide range of matters of national importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope found that the present arrangements are capable of improvement, and that those who received our intelligence assessments felt that against the tests of quality, timeliness and relevance, Australia&#39;s intelligence production is not as good as it should be. </para>
          <para>The Government is determined to correct this situation. The Government&#39;s decisions reflect acceptance in principle of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s recommendations but incorporate some variations on matters of organisation and administrative arrangements where these were considered desirable by our advisers. The Government has decided there shall be a new intelligence assessments agency, entitled the Office of National Assessments, which will be concerned with assessing international intelligence and not with domestic situations. The Office shall be concerned with national assessments- &#39;national&#39; meaning a matter affecting the responsibility of more than one Minister, department or authority, or being of a level of importance warranting Cabinet reference, or being of importance to basic Government policy, or having major implications for the basic premises of departmental policy or programs. It shall avoid comment or advice regarding policy. The Office will not be organised to collect intelligence by clandestine or other means. It will draw its intelligence from other sources. </para>
          <para>Particular features to which I draw honourable members&#39; attention are that the Office shall be free from external direction as to the contents and conclusions of its reports and assessments. I emphasise to the House the utmost importance of that directive. It will be independent of any Government department or authority. Under the administrative arrangements order, it will be associated with my Department but will in no way be under its control. It shall be expected to offer objective intelligence reports and assessments. It will be able to co-operate with other agencies, for example, the Joint Intelligence Agency and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, in the production of joint reports and assessments. </para>
          <para>In due course, the Government has it in mind to introduce legislation defining the functions and responsibilities of the Office. The legislation will provide for a statutory office of DirectorGeneral of the Office of National Assessments. The Director-General of the Office will be of first division status and will report to the Prime Minister. The Office will consist of the DirectorGeneral and an Assessments Staff of officers who will include seconded officers from the Commonwealth departments, the defence force and the intelligence agencies. The Office would have a permanent core of career officers professionally qualified in the assessment of international intelligence in the political, strategic and economic fields. </para>
          <para>The subject matter of national interest will include international economic as well as international political and strategic questions. This reflects the Government&#39;s concern to have the best possible intelligence assessments on matters in the economic and resources fields which will be of increasing relevance. In addition, the Office will be assisted by a National Assessments Board and an Economic Assessments Board. These Boards will be chaired by the Director-General and consist of experts drawn from interested departments who will provide expert comment on the subjects under assessment. Reports from the Office will, however, be issued by the DirectorGeneral and on his authority. The Government intends that the Director-General should have access to all information and expert advice necessary for him to make his assessments. </para>
          <para>The Office of National Assessments is to have a major role in the production of intelligence assessments and will be an important part of the intelligence community. As mentioned earlier, the community will be subject to policy control and managerial oversight, through the machinery arrangements at ministerial and permanent head level decided on by the Government. However, the responsibility for existing agencies in the community- for example, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Joint Intelligence Organisation- will remain with the present Ministers. The Royal Commissioner recognised the continued need for an intelligence capacity in specialised areas of defence, working in close conjunction with the new Office. He found that in these areas also intelligence needed to be timely, relevant and of quality. The Government has accepted that the defence organisation needs to retain an intelligence capacity. Consequently, the Joint Intelligence Organisation will continue under its present title and with its existing functions, except those in the area of national assessments and current intelligence which will be transferred to the new Office. </para>
          <para>While the Government intends to establish the Office of National Assessments by legislation, reforms are too urgently needed to await enactment of that legislation. Consistent with the approach taken by the Royal Commissioner, the Government has decided that the changes should be implemented forthwith, by administrative action in anticipation of the passage of legislation. The Government has decided to appoint a most distinguished public servant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> W. Furlonger as the Head of the new Office. I might add that he has had experience in this area, in the Joint Intelligence Organisation, on other occasions. </para>
          <para>Finally, I should mention 2 particular matters. The first is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s recommendation that the head offices of the intelligence agencies should be located in Canberra. The Government believes that the intelligence agencies should be given maximum opportunity to keep in touch with all parts of the system of government. We shall examine the practicality of moving the head offices. In any event, the Government will encourage the greatest possible contact between the intelligence community and the other arms of government &#39; in order to ensure that the intelligence community and the departments of government are in close touch and accord on matters of concern to the government and the community. Secondly, honourable members will note that the Royal Commissioner has stressed the need to achieve a bi-partisan attitude on these important questions of intelligence and security which affect the national interest. I have therefore arranged with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> that he should be kept informed of significant matters in this field on a continuing basis under arrangements of secrecy. This follows the convention which applies in the United Kingdom. When I was Leader of the Opposition the then Prime Minister saw to it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope informed me of the course of his inquiries. That was done. I have made sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope keeps the Leader of the Opposition continually informed. In relation to these particular matters the Leader of the Opposition was briefed earlier today by my Department. </para>
          <para>The decisions announced today involve significant improvements to our intelligence arrangements. This will be achieved in particular by the new ministerial and senior officials&#39; committees of the intelligence community. These will provide policy guidance and direction which have been lacking in the past and which are essential in this crucial area of Australia&#39;s interest. Secondly, the establishment of a new intelligence agency with specific responsibilities for national assessments will enable the Government to receive high quality information on a broad range of areas of importance. Thirdly, the retention of the existing intelligence agencies and ministerial arrangements will ensure that those interests requiring special attention continue to receive it. This applies particularly to the intelligence requirements of the defence organisation. </para>
          <para>Matters of intelligence and security are of fundamental national concern. They deserve the maximum possible informed debate and discussion, one hopes without passion and emotion. We agree with the Royal Commissioner that our agencies need to be as good as our resources allow, and that their activities need strong support and firm leadership from the Government. The decisions announced today demonstrate the Government&#39;s determination to see that Australia has the best possible system of coordination and control of intelligence and security services and that high quality intelligence assessments on political, strategic and economic matters are available to government. The Government is most appreciative of the work done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope in the course of his inquiry. He has undertaken a thorough and painstaking study of the security and intelligence arrangements in this country and has presented a very valuable and creative report. I welcome this opportunity to thank  His  Honour for his service to Australia. </para>

            <para>- by leave- Those who have heard the speech of the Prime Minister- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and those who will read the abridgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope&#39;s report which he has tabled will realise how important and urgent it was that an inquiry should be made such as has now been concluded. I join in the : Prime Minister&#39;s appreciation of the work that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope has done, painstakingly, com- : petently, in this field, as we expected he would. I would like to take this opportunity, as I have on earlier occasions, to express my own appreci-. anon of the co-operation of the then Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Askin, and the Chief Justices of New South Wales during that period in making available the services of supreme court judges, not least <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hope who served twice in conducting inquiries for my Government </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>You will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that when you were Leader of the Opposition I advised you of the proposed terms of reference, the proposed appointment of the Royal Commission and the proposed appointment of the royal com-, missioner some days before they were an- &#39;nounced. I also initiated the practice of having the Leader of the Opposition fully briefed as and when he desired on all the matters covered by this report As the Prime Minister has acknowledged, I continued that practice and, as I acknowledge, he has continued it I believe that nothing but benefit can come to the nation from having alternative governments fully and responsibly apprised of matters of such great national concern. </para>
          <para>I would not wish to speak at any length on the document and the associated documents which I have been shown. My impression might be that . I might have adhered more closely to the royal commissioner&#39;s recommendations concerning the terms of reference of the ministerial committee or the greater cohesion of the existing agencies. But that is only an impression I have at - this first instance. </para>
          <para>There is another very clear thrust from the report, and that is that economic and resources fields will be assessed as well as and independently of the political and strategic questions The appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Furlonger</inline> is in every respect a proper one. I would imagine that we can say that with that appointment and other appointments which have been made- they were made after consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Hopethe security and intelligence services of our own country and the relations between those and the security and intelligence services of other countries will be conducted with enhanced benefit to our country. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- I wish to inform the House of the Government&#39;s current attitude towards the price/wage pause, particularly in the light of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission&#39;s decision to proceed with the March quarter national wage case. The Government remains strongly of the view that the price/wage pause has the overwhelming support of the Australian community. A Morgan gallup poll conducted during the Anzac Day weekend disclosed that 75 per cent of the respondents supported the freeze. That figure included  62 per cent of people who indicated that they normally voted for the Labor Party. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Despite the inevitable difficulties and complexities Australians saw in the joint call of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Premiers a rare bipartisan gesture designed to respond to a national problem. The freeze drew rapid support from employer groups throughout Australia. Within 2 days of the freeze being announced representatives of every major employer organisation pledged their support for the freeze. </para>
          <para>I would like at this stage to record the Government&#39;s gratitude for the swift and generous response of a wide section of the business community so far as price restraint is concerned. I illustrate by pointing out that my Department in the past 3 weeks has been in touch with 104 companies requesting that they agree to deferrals of decisions on price applications before the Prices Justification Tribunal. In all but 2 cases agreement has been obtained. </para>
          <para>The Government does not underestimate the very significant financial sacrifices made by some companies in agreeing to our approach. In the light of such support from the community the </para>
          <para class="block">Government believes its clear responsibility is to take all reasonable steps to achieve the objective so clearly envisaged by the 7 heads of government 3 weeks ago. That was a price pause matched by a wage pause. </para>
          <para>Quite clearly the decision to be made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in respect of the March quarter national wage case is critical to the prospects of the freeze succeeding. The Government acknowledges that unless the March national wage case decision represents substantial reciprocity on the wages side it would be unreasonable to expect business to exercise the same level of restraint as applies at the present time. </para>
          <para>The Government was naturally disappointed that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission did not accede to its submission that the current hearing be postponed. Nevertheless the Commission has indicated that in deciding to proceed with the hearing it has in no way preempted the ultimate result of that hearing. The Government notes the Commission&#39;s indication that if possible awards of money increases in wages should be deferred until after a decision has been given on the March quarter figure. We also note the view of the Commission that at this stage it saw no useful purpose in calling a conference, as suggested by the Victorian Government. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the question of prices pending the Commission&#39;s decision on the March quarter figure. The Government renews its request to companies which had received approvals for price increases from the Prices Justification Tribunal prior to 13 April last not to implement those increases pending the outcome of the current wage case. In respect of those companies which at 13 April had price applications before, or which have subsequently submitted price applications to, the Prices Justification Tribunal, I inform the House that I have today sent messages to those companies asking them to agree to extend the decision date on their price notifications to 23 May. It is the Government&#39;s understanding that the March quarter national wage case decision will be available in sufficient time for it to have been assessed by the Government by that date. The Government expresses the hope that all companies in this category will respond to its request and that only those facing acute viability problems or those which, as a consequence of not increasing prices, are likely to retrench employees during the period before the Commission&#39;s decision will seek to exercise their current statutory right to receive a decision from the Prices Justification Tribunal prior to the </para>
          <para class="block">Commission&#39;s decision on the case currently before it. </para>
          <para>The Prices Justification Tribunal will of course continue to examine price notifications currently before it or subsequently received so that as far as practicable decisions can proceed if it becomes apparent that there is insufficient reciprocity in respect of wages to match the level of price restraint now in force and which the Government hopes will remain in force pending the Commission&#39;s decision. It is entirely appropriate for the Tribunal to examine price notifications currently before it whilst the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission continues to hear a current national wage case. The Government recognises that the present circumstances create special problems for companies which deal in commodities or whose goods or services are critically dependent on fluctuations in import prices. It had een the Government&#39;s intention that if support in principle to the objective of a price-wage pause had been forthcoming from all relevant sections of the community the problems of these companies could have been amongst the areas to be examined by the special committee comprising representatives of employees, employers and the Prices Justification Tribunal which the Government had proposed establishing. </para>
          <para>As honourable members are aware the major peak councils of the trade union movement have not been prepared to support in principle the objective of a price-wage pause. In these circumstances it would not be appropriate to establish the committee. Nevertheless the Government believes that some mechanism should be available pending the decision on the current wage case to examine special problems faced by companies which deal in commodities or whose goods or services are critically dependent on fluctuations in import prices. Such of those companies whose turnover exceeds $30m per year are already subject to the notification procedures of the Prices Justification Act, and I have already explained the attitude of the Government towards all companies covered by the notification procedures of that Act. </para>
          <para>In respect of companies within the special category I have mentioned and which are not currently within the notification procedures of the Prices Justification Act, it is proposed that for the duration of the period of the current national wage case they accept the jurisdiction of the Prices Justification Tribunal. The basis is that if any such companies are in fact experiencing acute viability problems or face an employment situation of the type I have described above they should approach the Prices Justification Tribunal and accept the determination of that body regarding proposed price increases. I have discussed this proposal with the Acting  Chairman  of the Tribunal who has indicated that the Tribunal is prepared to participate in such an arrangement. </para>
          <para>I should, however, make it clear that this arrangement is designed to cope with what the Government believes to be a limited number of cases and that no company should expect a favourable determination from the Tribunal unless it has in fact clearly established that it will, during the period between now and the Commission&#39;s decision, experience acute viability problems or in fact as a consequence of not increasing prices actually retrench employees during that period. The request I made to the Prices Justification Tribunal on 14 April to defer decisions on price notifications before it pending agreement being reached on the pause remains subject only to what I have said earlier in this statement regarding companies experiencing acute viability or employment difficulties. The Government&#39;s instruction to its departments and agencies regarding increases in charges will of course remain fully in force. </para>
          <para>I should, in addition, make it clear that the pause in no way inhibits the practice of many retailers offering specials. To argue otherwise would be against the interests of consumers who benefit from the temporary price reductions involved in the practice of &#39;specials&#39;. Naturally the relevant price of an item on &#39;special&#39; as at 13 April would be the normal price prevailing in respect of that item prior to 13 April and the subsequent return of the item from the &#39;special&#39; to the normal price does not constitute a breach of the pause. I again express the Government&#39;s appreciation of the support which was so readily forthcoming from such a wide spectrum of the community. I also express the hope that it will still be possible to achieve the effective implementation of the price-wage pause which the community demonstrably supports. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-We returned to this House a little less than 3 weeks ago, in the week immediately following the announcement by the Government that Australia was to enjoy a prices and wages freeze. On the very first day that we returned to this House we sought from the Government an opportunity to question in debate the ramifications of that announcement and the way in which it would affect particularly the wage and salary earners in this country. Until today, we have been denied this right. Until today we have been denied this sort of information. The Government&#39;s statement is short on information as to the impact of the socalled wages and prices freeze. Not only does it have ramifications within Australia but the announcement by the Government, after what appeared to be a 1 5 minute discussion at the conclusion of the Premiers Conference, has brought Australia into some sort of international ridicule among countries which observed the mammoth devaluation late last year, together with the announcement, after as I said, a 15 minute discussion, of a wages and prices freeze. This action has brought upon Australia the scorn of international financial and economic observers. I should like to refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> of 16 April. On that day the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> stated: </para>

            <para>Snap freeze, might not last. Only four months ago after the devaluation of the Australian dollar by 17.S per cent, the Liberal-Country party coalition this week took economic ad hockery to new heights. Emerging from a meeting with the Premiers of the six Australian states, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, announced on the steps of parliament in Canberra a three-month voluntary wage and price freeze. Cabinet colleagues and official advisers were stunned- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Certainly the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> who is at the table, was stunned- the idea had only been raised a few hours earlier, by the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dick</inline> Hamer, and was expected to get short shrift. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline>Canberra two step is only the latest sign of uncertainty in Australia&#39;s economic management. No sooner had the November devaluation been decided than the currency rate managers started hauling it back up to give what is now only a 12.2 per cent devaluation. This retreat was acknowledgment that the Government had devalued too much in the first place, and was worried that it would fuel inflation rather than exports. How long before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser&#39;s</inline> second thoughts on the freeze? </para>
          <para class="block">So as I have said, not only have people poured scorn and ridicule on the idea here in Australia but also internationally it has done Australia grave damage. </para>
          <para>I want to take the House step by step through the Minister&#39;s statement and show what has happened in Australia subsequent to the announcement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I want to make the point that the 7 heads of government agreed that it was to be a voluntary wage and price freeze. The voluntary section of the price and wage freeze disappeared within about 48 hours as this Government announced that it was to be a mandatory wage freeze and a voluntary price freeze. Subsequently the Victorian Premier, the South Australian &#39; Premier, the New South Wales Premier, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and all other peak union councils withdrew from giving it any support. </para>
          <para>The Minister told us in the opening paragraph of his statement that yesterday the submission from the national Government- a submission to put aside this national wage hearing for the March quarter-was rejected by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Yet we have this statement before the House today telling us that there is still some hope for the wage-price freeze. This seems to fly in the face of the announcement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Polites, the employers&#39; representative, that companies ought to get their applications before the Prices Justification Tribunal as quickly as possible. The Minister shakes his . head, which seems to be a more sensible sign - than anything contained in the document Let me put it this way: Perhaps the Minister is shaking his head because he thinks that it really does  matter if one only gets one&#39;s application before the PJT because the impact of the price increase does not matter until it takes effect But if we look at the piece of arithmetic that is now in motion in - Australia and if on the day the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were to give its decision that an across-the-board 2.3 per cent wage increase was to take place in Australia and if the PJT were to announce all the price increases in the pipeline, then obviously the wheel would be started again. A new national wage case would be in the making immediately and there would be no 2.3 per cent in the next quarter because obviously what the Government is doing is creating an oversupply of price increases which wal hit us in one go. It may happen on 23 May, it may happen on 23 June or it may happen on 23 July, but , somewhere along the Une in the not too distant : future the Australian consumer is going to be hit with a deluge of price increases which will make  prices appear as though they are skyrocketing on &#39; every commodity in A-ustralia </para>
          <para>The Government seems to gain great comfort from the fact that a Morgan gallop POll showed that 75 per cent of the Australian people initially supported the wage-price freeze. I suspect that one could cite the ANOP poll carried out for the Australian Broadcasting Commission which showed that just as many people believed the freeze was a phoney as those who believed it might do some good. But the Australian people, having been hoaxed by the promises of this Government in November 1975, when it told  them that all their economic problems would end with a change of government, are looking for some recipe which will give a hope of getting them out of the economic malaise Australia may be in. Obviously, if a question is framed in a certain way, one is going to assist the sort of response that is sought. It is a very dishonest way in which to conduct a poh. </para>
          <para>It is not the first time the Morgan gallup poll has been responsible for this type of dishonesty. It is notorious for the last polls it took in 1972, the last of which showed that the coalition partnersthe Liberal Party and the Country Partywere going to win the election that was due to be held. Prior to the display of the figures by the Morgan gall.up poll people, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan</inline> publicly told us that he was a great supporter of the Liberal Party, which certainly had influenced the outcome of that p911. So here again we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morgan,</inline> doing his part as a stooge for the Government, giving a result of a poll showing that 75 per cent of the people supported a priceswages freeze. </para>
          <para>Not only does aU the evidence fly in the face of the result of that phoney pOll, but as each day passes and as consumers become increasingly aware of the price increases which are taking place throughout Australia, more and more people are becoming disillusioned with this fairyland promise of the good that a prices and wages freeze will do. There can be no doubt that a-poll taken legitimately now would show that more people are opposed to this move by the Government than are for it because, as I said, more people can see now that it was a compulsory wage freeze and a voluntary price freeze. The Minister also tells us in his statement that despite the inevitable difficulties and complexities Australians saw in the joint call, nevertheless they responded to the national problem. </para>
          <para>One of the complaints that we have on this side of the House is that the Government has been unable to give details of the impact of this wages-prices freeze. For a month we have been asking the Government to give us some information as to what it all means. If after 15 minutes discussion the Government can announce a prices-wages freeze, one would have thought that it would have put a sufficient number of public servants to work to give us some of the finer details of this wages-prices freeze. If, as the Minister claims, Australians saw aU the complexities and difficulties associated with it, they certainly were showing a far greater perception of the problems than did the Government. </para>
          <para>One of the extraordinary features of the announcement of the Prime Minister was that he made the announcement without any consultation with any of his colleagues, with perhaps the exception of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> Honourable members will have noticed that the Treasurer, who likes to get up and let the blood rush to his head on many of these economic issues, for the last month has been extraordinarily silent on the wages-prices freeze. We have not seen the Treasurer representing his Department, telling us what a great economic feat a prices-wages freeze would be. Obviously his Department is opposed to it. Other Ministers have ad it imposed upon them and are not quite sure what it means. They certainly cannot explain the difficulties associated with it. The Minister said that very quickly the Government felt the response of employers was one of acceptance of what the Government was trying to do. In fact, he stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The freeze drew rapid support from employer groups throughout Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, that sentence of the Minister&#39;s statement provides the key to the whole problem. </para>
          <para>In most circumstances- certainly not all circumstances, as is evidenced by some other material I shall lay before the House a little later- why would not the average employer give a rapid response to such a suggestion? The suggestion was made a few weeks before the next national wage hearing was due to commence. In all cases the employers had been able to make the price increases that they required for the first quarter of the year. The wage case that was to be conducted- it started yesterday- was to catch up with the price increases that had taken place in the first quarter of this year. So we had the wage and salary earners of Australia trying to get some justice from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commision in terms of a wage increase only to catch up with the price increases in January, February and March of this year. Now, if employers had already received their price increases, why would they not agree to a wage-price freeze if the essence of what it meant was to abolish the March quarter hearing of the national wage case? That is exactly what it meant. Obviously, a lot of employers rushed in. </para>
          <para>Then the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs tells us that a lot of industries agree with the wage-price freeze. They have been to see him. They have responded to the telexes, the telegrams and the telephone calls. But let us have a closer look at what that means. On Monday of this week, to the disgrace of this Government, we found that in discussing the wage-price freeze behind closed doors employers and manufacturers were agreeing to the freeze at a price which the whole community had to pay. There has been no denial of the stories which appeared in the newspapers on Monday of this week. Not one Minister has said that these stories are untrue. What are the stories? When the automobile manufacturers were called in to discuss with the Government the price-wage freeze a Press statement was released after their meeting which said that everything was lovely in the garden and that the Government and the automobile manufacturers of Australia had reached agreement. That was the end of the Press statement. The Government came out of the meeting beating its chest and saying that it had the support of all these major employers- General Motors-Holden&#39;s, Ford, Chrysler, the assemblers and the importers. The Government said that they all agreed that the price-wage freeze is a good thing for Australia. </para>
          <para>Then, a week later, out comes all the garbage. Out comes all the information about what has been going on behind closed doors. Out comes all the things that the Australian people do not know about how this Government obtained agreement. I want to quote from the newsletter <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline> of 29 April. It says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A request by the Prime Minister to the States seeking a delay in exhaust emission control standards will provoke strong resistance from consumer and environment groups. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> last week undertook to ask the States to defer application of design rule 27E, the emission control rule, as a trade-off for support by car manufacturers of the price freeze. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> gave the undertaking last week in Canberra at a conference of motor industry leaders and senior Ministers. He was told by the industry that the new emission control standards to come into operation. </para>

              <para>- In my opinion the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders being moved by the honourable member for Oxley covers the subject that the House has just voted on in a definitive way. I also point out that the debate has only been adjourned and that the subject matter of the debate has not been taken from the notice paper. For those 2 reasons I suggest that the honourable member for Oxley &#39;s motion on the procedure is not one that can be accepted. </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable member for Corio also will resume his seat. What the honourable member for Oxley said in his point of order is not correct. At present the business before the House is the continuation of the subject matter discussed by the House prior to the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> No motion has been moved by the Government in regard to any function or any other factor relating to this House. I suggest to the honourable member for Oxley that the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders was moved on an incorrect assumption. I point out to him that when the motion for the adjournment of the debate was moved he was on his feet. He had not received the call. The call was to go to the Government side because there had been a  speaker  from the Government side and one from the Opposition. The Government side should, therefore, have received the call, which I gave to it. The honourable member for Oxley continued speaking even after the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bourchier)</inline> had moved that the debate be adjourned. It was at that stage I asked the honourable member for Oxley to resume his seat. He asked whether he could finish the point he was making. If he had been allowed to finish his point he could have been considered to have spoken on the Bill. Therefore, he would have had no further chance to speak on the motion that the House take note of the statement. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline>a number of these amendments are consequential upon two or three substantial amendments. But the amendments in toto are matters of procedure. Basically they arise out of the problem that sometimes reasons may be called for, reasons may not be called for or they may not be given or no notice may be given in certain circumstances of decisions. Where action is taken in relation to seeking either reasons or a review of a decision, it was felt that some amendments should be made in order to cover that type of situation. The amendment No. (4)- clause 17 of the Bill- amends section 28 ( 1 ) of the principal Act. It entitles a person to apply within a prescribed time to a decision-maker to obtain reasons for a decision. This provision does not work satisfactorily when a person who may be affected by a decision is not notified of the decision when it is made. The new sub-sections lA and lB which it is proposed to insert into section 28 have the effect that a decision-maker may refuse to give reasons if, first, a person who has been notified in writing of the decision does not apply for reasons within 28 days of being so notified and, second, a person who has not been notified in writing of the decision does not apply for reasons within a reasonable time. The Tribunal is to be empowered to determine the question whether the application for reasons has been made within a reasonable time. </para>
        <para>The amendment numbered (6)- clause 18 of the Bill- has the effect of setting the prescribed time limit of 28 days for applying to the Tribunal for a review of the decision only where the applicant for review has received written notification of the decision or the decision-maker has failed to make the decision within the time allowed by law for the making of that decision. The other substantial amendment is that numbered (8)- clause 18 of the Bill. The new sub-sections proposed to be inserted by this amendment provide for cases where first a prescribed time within which an application must be made to the Tribunal for the review of the particular decision does not apply because no person was given written notice of the decision; and, second, the person seeking review had not himself been furnished with written notice of that decision although such a notice had been furnished to another person. In either case the application for review may be rejected by the Tribunal unless it has been made within a reasonable time after the making of the decision or the Tribunal is of the opinion that there are special circumstances that would justify it in entertaining the application for review. The purpose of the amendment numbered (9)-clause 19 of the Bill-is to permit a person in whose favour a decision has been made to intervene in proceedings before the Tribunal in which that decision is challenged by some other person. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline> for those reasons I have moved the amendments standing in my name. </para>

          <para>-The Opposition agrees with the amendments moved by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> which are consequential and procedural amendments. But I raise again with the Attorney-General the matter I raised at the second reading stage. I ask him whether he recalls that I made a submission to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> It is of some importance and I trust that this time we will understand one another on the issues involved. On 4 October I asked why determinations of the Insurance Tribunal are not made public once they have been advised to the Treasurer, the Insurance Commissioner and the company concerned. The response I received was as follows: </para>

          <para>While an authority to carry on insurance business granted by the Insurance Tribunal is required under the Insurance Act to be notified in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette -</inline></para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That was the position- there is no such provision in relation to refusals of authority, and legal advice indicates that it would be impracticable for this information to be published in a similar way under existing legislation. However, the proposed amendments to the Insurance Act which I foreshadowed earlier this year would provide, among other things, for the insertion of an appropriate provision in the Act to empower the Commissioner to publish notice of a refusal in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> as soon as practicable after the expiration of the appeal period. It is proposed that the amending legislation will be introduced into Parliament during the 1 977 autumn sittings. </para>
        <para class="block">The point I impress upon the Attorney-General is that in this case, irrespective of the amendments earlier carried in the Act, the transfer for appeal has now gone to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The point I am making is simply that while there is an appeal against rejection of an authority to underwrite, the thing that concerns me is that if the appeal is upheld by the Tribunal against a company to authorise to underwrite insurance, that ought to be made public as quickly as possible after the decision. </para>
        <para>I am trying to convey the disastrous downstream effects which occurred over 2 years ago in Victoria where this was not undertaken. It has been mandatory on the Commissioner or the Tribunal to declare when authority has been granted but not when it has been rejected. The Attorney-General has more competence in this area than I have but I would like an assurance from him that if such an appeal is to lie in this particular case, immediate publication of its rejection is published either in a newspaper or in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline></para>

          <para>- The honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi)</inline> raises a point which relates to the Life Insurance Amendment Bill and the Insurance Amendment Bill. As I indicated in my reply in the second reading debate, it is open to  the Tribunal to publish its reasons for a decision in either case. However, I will have the honourable member&#39;s question looked at and I will draw it to the attention of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> to see whether any step can be taken in relation to it or whether there is any step which the Government thinks ought to be taken in relation to it. I will certainly have examined the problem which the honourable member raised. </para>

          <para>- I wish the matter was as simple as that. What has to be understood is that an insurance company could have untold thousands of people holding policies and the difficulty and hardship arise because, if the right to underwrite insurance is rejected, it is not granted an authority. Thousands of people could suffer hardship if they are not given the opportunity and time to make appropriate alternative arrangements. The situation in Victoria is critical and it could become more critical at any time. So I think that provision ought to be made in this particular case for it to be mandatory to make a public statement. </para>

        <para class="block">These are procedural amendments, some of which are consequential. I shall deal with those which are more substantial, even though they are all procedural. The Bill provides that classes of decisions may be excluded by regulation from its ambit. Decisions so excluded are therefore excluded from those decisions referred to in the Bill as &#39;decisions to which this Act applies&#39;. As the Bill stands, one result of excluding a class of decisions by regulation is that the supervisory jurisdiction of the State courts, otherwise excluded by clause 9, revives. That is because clause 9 excludes that jurisdiction only in relation to a decision to which the Act applies. The first amendment, which seeks to amend clause 3, together with the amendment I have moved to clause 19, would have the result that excluding a class of decisions by regulations does not have the effect of reviving the supervisory jurisdiction of State courts which, honourable members will recall, we are seeking to be rid of under clause 9. The supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia under section 75 (v) of the Constitution would, of course, remain unaffected. </para>
        <para>The second amendment is to clause 1 1. Clause 1 1 would require an application for review of a decision, other than a decision made by way of a report or recommendation, to be made within a prescribed period. The prescribed period is specified in sub-clause (3) of clause 11. The period of 28 days would begin to run from the day on which the person who seeks the review of the decision was notified in writing of the decision. These provisions would make no provision for the time within which application for review should be made where the person seeking review has not been notified in writing of the decision. The effect of this amendment is that the prescribed period of 28 days does not apply where the person seeking review was not notified in writing of the decision. </para>
        <para>I now turn to amendment No. 3. The new subsections proposed to be inserted by this amendment provide for the cases where, first, the prescribed period of 28 days for applying for review of a decision does not apply because no person was given written notice of the decision, and secondly, the person seeking review had not himself been furnished with written notice of the decision, although such a notice had been given to some other person. In either case, the application for review may be rejected by the court unless it has been made within a reasonable time after the making of the decision. </para>
        <para>I draw the attention of the Committee to amendment No. 6. The purpose of clause 13 is to give a person entitled to apply to the court for a review of a decision the right to be given written reasons for the decision. This is a most important amendment. The effect of the new sub-clauses inserted by this amendment would be that a request for reasons may be refused by the decision-maker where, firstly, the person requesting reasons had been notified in writing of the decision and had not made his request within 28 days of being so notified; and secondly, the person requesting reasons had not been notified in writing of the decision and had not made his request within a reasonable time after the decision was made. The court is to be empowered to rule on the question whether a request was made within a reasonable time or not. </para>
        <para>The purpose of the additional amendments Nos 1 to 3 is to exclude from the ambit of the Bill decisions of State officials exercising powers under State laws applied in relation to Commonwealth places by the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act. </para>

            <para>-Last night when the debate on this Bill was interrupted I was speaking about the fact that the Joy report had been completed and submitted to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> for consideration by him, his Department and the 2 State governments involved. We had debated the situation of railways in Australia and had decided that rail services were still most essential. But we did admit that they had to be subsidised to a very great extent. To expect them to be converted into profit making bodies by some magic stroke was beyond the realms of reality. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We must continually be looking for that much needed improvement in efficiency to provide more attractive and economic services in our railways. The Australian Railways Research Development Organisation has a very real part to play in co-ordinating State and Commonwealth operated services and in giving advice on technical and policy planning for Australian railways. Although a great deal has been achieved in recent years there is still a very great need for rationalisation and particularly the modernisation of our systems. The railways are bedevilled with aging rolling stock which contributes to present inefficiencies and high maintenance charges. There is a great need to upgrade much of the track and there can be delays because of outdated freight handling systems. It has also been estimated that there is a shortage of some 3000 freight wagons in Australia for use on the interstate systems. In the report of the Department of Transport for 1973-74 it was suggested that 20 per cent more freight wagons were required as so much of the potential rail freight had to be diverted to other forms of transport. </para>
          <para>However, it would be unfair to say that our railways are a complete disaster. In the last 20 years significant advances have been made. It is possible now to travel between all States on a standard gauge, thanks to the Government acting on the recommendations of the Wentworth Committee. Vast sums of money have been spent in the upgrading of existing standard gauge lines. The dieselisation of all systems is complete and there have been vast improvements in the signalling and control systems within the networks of our various railways. There is, of course, a future for the railways. Rail continues to be best suited to the carriage of freight over middle and long distances and is certainly a very real force in the handling of bulk freight. As the energy crisis looms before us we are reminded that the railways do give a better return on fuel consumption compared with road transport, using less than one-third per tonne kilometre of fuel. As far as passenger traffic is concerned, walking and cycling are the only modes of transport which use less energy than do the railways. Australian National Railways is in passenger transport business as well with more than 130 000 passengers using the trans-Australia line in 1974-75. We also now have an obligation to look after the interests of passengers travelling in both South Australia and Tasmania. Tasmanian Railways, of course, now provide virtually only freight services with the Tasman Limited from Hoban to Wynyard being the exception. One wonders what can be done to improve the Tasmanian system, bearing in mind that its has narrow gauge, the short haul nature of rail traffic moved and the type of construction that was devised for the tracks. Tasmanian Railways has taken an absolute hammering from road operators during the past 10 years or so. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that the Joy report indicates that the Tasmanian system is the worst in Australia and that, on the surface, there would seem to be not future for Tasmanian Railways. However, because of confidence in the timber industry and in the bulk freight lines the suggestions of the Joy report could mean that Tasmanian Railways could be with us for a long time to come. It would seem that if the Joy report is accepted the 2 passenger services operating in Tasmania would cease in the not too distant future. The South Australian situation is somewhat different with the South Australian Transport Minister, under the terms of the agreement, still having a great deal of say in the future of that system concerning the closure of lines, the reduction of services and the number of people who are employed within the South Australian system. I sympathise with the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> It must be an extremely difficult situation at times for the Federal Minister for Transport to deal with his South Australian counterpart. It would seem that some of the accusations that come from that State are beyond the realms of reality. One of the most recent of those particular matters concerned the alleged reneging of the Commonwealth on the transfer which we are debating tonight. Another was his claim that the Commonwealth did not intend to go ahead with the Tarcoola-Alice Springs Railway. Both have proved to be completely false. One would hope that in the future there will be much closer co-operation with the South Australian Minister. </para>
          <para>As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Commonwealth was ripped off in its deal with the South Australian Railways but it is now up to the Commonwealth to make the most of the situation. The fact that the Minister for Transport, even though the Commonwealth has a financial responsibility, must have the concurrence of the South Australian Transport Minister to close lines on reduced services could be a good example of just how that co-operation could work. If nothing more, the Commonwealth, not being so closely involved with the specific situation, could be in a better position to be more objective in measures that politically could be difficult for a State government to face, such as the closure of lines or the reduction of personnel. Quite often when a Une is closed it will bring howls of protest from the citizens affected, even though half a dozen people may have been using that particular service. </para>
          <para>Obviously, there are areas in the legislation before us tonight which are of particular interest to employees of the railways in South Australia and in Tasmania. For example, it wil certainly give employees in South Australia the option to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Clause 13 repeals section 54 of the Act. Section 54 set the retiring age at 65 years, with the option to retire at 60 years, with the permission of the Railways Commissioner. All employees will come under the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This matter has been discussed in the debate. The amendments are important to these new areas of operation of the Australian National Railways. I support these amendments and look forward to the speedy passage of this Bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I shall not delay the House on this legislation, but there are one or two aspects of it and of the remarks made by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> in his second reading speech to which I should like to draw attention. The first clearly is that the position of the 2 State railway systems which are being taken over is most likely not greatly different from other State railway systems. A rundown has been experienced over the last 20 years, to the extent that the finances, maintenance and general equipment of Australian raUway systems are far below the standards which ought to be accepted. I think that the House is well aware that the position of railways has changed dramatically in the last 30 years. It has been subject to and caught up with technological change. At the time when expansion took place in State railway systems and very heavy expenditures were involved, motor vehicles, which are better adapted to short-haul transport, were evolving to a stage at which they competed on very favourable terms with the railways. They had the advantage of flexibility and mobility which were not available to railways. They also had a secondary advantage in that the persons operating that type of transport were not required to build and maintain their own roads. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the main, the railway systems of Australia have serious problems with regard to maintenance, cost cutting and, as the second reading speech of the Minister indicates, commercial operation. I should Uke to believe that commercial operation is possible, but there is no evidence that any railway system in the world is capable of commercial operation if it is to provide the levels of service which warrant continued operation, both socially and economically. Australian railway systems are now at a point at which they will have to consider rolling stock. Diesel locomotives were introduced into Australia some 24 or 25 years ago. The original diesel locomotives are still operative and are well into the multiple millions of miles of operation. </para>
          <para>The fuel situation in the world would suggest that whilst diesel locomotives are far more economic as far as operation, installation and capital cost are concerned, electrification of main trunk railways in Australia wil have to be considered as a change of energy source, to conserve the fuel which they are currently using, namely dieselene. This will involve an extremely high capital cost, and one which certainly Will not be met by State railway systems. It is also most likely time that the Commonwealth looked at a further extension of the standard gauge system in Australia, to provide communications not only between MelbourneSydneyBrisbane, but on a wider basis. The question is whether railways have a future- I think they have- as bulk carriers and movers of large quantities of goods over long distances. There certainly is no prospect of railways operating as door-to-door carriers on their own. It is possible for them to be utilised in conjunction with private transport operations. For a number of years containerisation has been used in co-operation with transport groups on a carriage pickup basis. </para>
          <para>I think an event which happened in Sydney not very long ago highlights the problems which all railway systems are now facing. It alarms me to read suggestions that the lowest paid section of the railway work force- the repairers, the gangers and the track supervisors- are being exposed to blame in the case of the Granville railway accident when, in fact, the major blame rests with those who provide and those who control the finances. Despite the rates of pay paid for these necessary services- traditionally they are extraordinarily low- the employees concerned are very conscientious. But they are only able to do work within the scope which they are allowed by factors of time and direction. Over a number of years cost cutting in railway systems in Australia has become a major factor and one which this House, the Minister for Transport and those responsible for railways ought to be considering. Whilst there has been one accident which highlights one set of points, anyone who takes the trouble to walk along any stretch of railway in Australia whether it be heavily used or otherwise, wil find that maintenance is below par. Many stretches of Une - </para>

              <para>-They are below par and they are dangerous. They are dangerous because the cost of operating railways has gone beyond the capacity of those who are responsible to meet that cost. The importance of railway services is not recognised in either this Parliament or State parliaments. They are looked on very much as being vehicles to carry someone&#39;s goods on a subsidised basis but not to carry those goods which normally would carry a high freight rate. This is a disadvantage in the freedoms of individuals. But the other major transport systems in Australia. both road and air, are very heavily subsidised by this Government. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Despite complaints about cost recovery etc., this Government provides considerable funds for those transport systems; but the railways receive almost nothing. There are no CommonwealthState railways grants as there are road grants, yet the road grants provide a basic transport system on which goods are conveyed. Without those funds interstate highways would not carry the commercial traffic which exists. In this instance the Commonwealth is finalising the taking over of 2 of Australia&#39;s State railway systems. If that wil mean that those railway systems will be adequately financed and will be able to provide the technical levels which should be available in this system for efficient and safe operation, that is a good thing. If it only means that the State budgets are going to be relieved of providing funds or that the Commonwealth will become Uncle Scrooge in place of a smaller Uncle </para>
          <para class="block">Scrooge, squeezing the systems and forcing cost cutting, it will not be a good thing. The Minister is in a position in which he has to convince the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> that the railways are worth feeding. </para>

              <para>-That may or may not be so; I am not going to argue about that one way or the other. At the moment the airlines do not think so because he has asked them to pay for their services. The States do not think so at the moment because he wants them to pay for their roads. What I am suggesting is that he has some responsibility to make some contribution towards the cost of bringing our railway systems up to scratch and to give serious consideration to the long-term conversion of the energy source for the main trunk railway lines from the diesel fuel to electricity. There is some electrification in Australia. If major electrification took place it would enable a better use of those solid fuels which are available in Australia to generate power and would provide a saving of scarce energy resources. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I said, I do not want to delay the House long. I think the Minister for Transport will understand my remarks. The railways systems of Australia, particularly in Victoria, the State in which I live, have been starved of adequate funds because of the high cost of operation, because of the degree of subsidised traffic which they must bear without that commitment being met from Treasury sources in the areas in which they operate and because they have been seen to be an easy way of avoiding expenditure. In Victoria for 10 years running the same amount of capital funding, in cash terms, was provided to the Victorian Railways. No business organisation could have operated on the same basis. This Parliament has a responsibily for the national transport systems. The road systems, whether or not the Minister provides the funds which the States believe he should provide, are not capable of expansion to meet our future long term transport needs. Bulk carriers are necessary and the railways provide the most efficient means of bulk carriage of goods over long distances within this continent. The railway systems must be equipped in order to deal with that problem into the future and should be so structured that they are able to conserve those energy sources in Australia which will be in short supply by using alternative energy sources which are available but which can be properly utilised only by the expenditure of substantial capital funds. </para>

            <para>-The Australian National Railways Amendment Bill now before the House has been introduced to finalise the transfer of the South Australian nonmetropolitan and Tasmanian railway systems to the Commonwealth. The transfer agreement which the Commonwealth, Tasmania and South Australia entered into on 1 July 1975 provides for an interim period of approximately 12 months during which detailed arrangements for the transfer of staff and operations to the Australian National Railways can be completed. The introduction of this Bill demonstrates the responsible attitude of this Government towards stable government. The agreement entered into by the Commonwealth and the 2 States has aspects which could well tempt the Government to seek to abandon the arrangement. However, it has decided, notwithstanding its misgivings as to the original propriety of the action, to honour the commitment of the former Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The consequence of this takeover by the Commonwealth is that South Australia and Tasmania have been relieved of a heavy financial burden relating to the perennial loss situation in which the rail services were conducted. Although States have been subjected to readjustments in funding through the Grants Commission, Loan Council programs and other financial assistance grants, the fact remains that the participant States are, as a result of the new arrangement, in a financially superior position whilst the balance of the Australian States will be required to contribute to the Commonwealth funding for the operation of these railways. It is no wonder that the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> was moved to remark that the 2 State Premiers were laughing all the way to the bank. Of course, it must be acknowledged that the previous Government invited all the States to transfer their railways to the Commonwealth. Whilst this may have constituted a passing temptation to the States, they could be excused for a high degree of apprehension as to the ultimate intention of the government of the day as State interests might be affected. Nevertheless the transfer is proceeding and it requires us to give some thought to the role of railways. </para>
          <para>It is significant that the Australian National Railways has assumed this additional burden in a loss situation. The statement of profit and loss for the year ending 30 June 1975, the most recent report available to the Parliament, shows an operating loss for the year of $14,479,427 and a carried forward accumulated loss of $4 1.5m. This is a substantial sum of money. It is sobering to read in the Joy report on Tasmanian railways the bald statement that the Tasmanian railways, notwithstanding the adoption of any recommendations incorporated in the report will never make a profit. With the exception of a few high paying lines most prominent in Queensland- this is as a result of the wise development of the State by the Queensland Government- which carry high loadings of mineral ores to seaboard ports, most railways are now in a similar situation. Those railways will never make a profit. </para>
          <para>This leaves us in a situation where we must contemplate a continuance of our escalating losses or assess the role of railways within Australia. It is imperative that in assessing the role of the railways we see them in an intermodal context. Of course this lends considerable substance to the insistence of the Minister for Tranport in respect of the abandonment of the Bureau of Roads that it is essential that the transport problems of Australia be considered in the whole and that the Bureau of Transport Economics is best equipped to discharge that obligation. We have the further consideration in a highly topical context at the moment of our finite fuel reserves. The world faces a critical situation in respect of oil supplies. In the end this could well affect the mobility of the transport in this nation. </para>
          <para>On the east-west route from Perth through to Adelaide and the eastern States road transport is escalating year by year at a prodigious rate. It is impossible for the railways to compete with the present situation. Therefore it is essential for the Government to determine where the limited resources of this nation, notwithstanding the huge potential we contain, must be directed to the best purpose. I agree with the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> that no form of transport will shift freight at a lower rate per ton than the railways. It seems unbelievable that we should contemplate a situation where if the Government does not proceed with the electrification of the railways system, we could be back in the age of steam where the transport of this nation will rely heavily on steam locomotion. It does seem extraordinary but this is a very real threat to the transport of this nation. </para>
          <para>To maintain mobility we must address ourselves to the role of the railways in the future. Unless we do so the loss situation of these railways will become an increasing burden on the taxpayer. Certainly this country has been burdened with the lack of foresight of our forebears who abandoned the prospect of standardisation of railways. As a consequence we are burdened with the cost of transferring freight at exchange points throughout the nation. Clearly, to standardise our railways over the vast length of our system is beyond the resources of this nation. We have bogie exchange points throughout the system but they are achieving less in results than was hoped; not simply because of the physical limitations of the bogie exchange techniques. In many respects, again as the honourable member for Corio pointed out, it is occurring as a consequence of less than efficient management in higher echelons. There are reports of wagons arriving at bogie exchange points for the transcontinental route which are clearly not in condition to make the long distance crossing. Therefore instead of a simple bogie exchange arrangement it is necessary to put the wagons aside and to delay freight which further discourages the users of the railways to persist in that practice. This has the effect of transferring these users to road services. </para>
          <para>Clearly the railway systems of this country must be given their due and be recognised as an essential element of its transportation requirements, There is an unbelievable scope for containerisation and capsuling of freight for fast and cheap transport. It is tragic that over the years the railway system has been outglamourised by other forms of transport such as heavy road transport and air transport. As a consequence the whole railway system has become tired. While many members of the railway unions apply themselves conscientiously and with considerable diligence to their jobs, there is a great cloud of despair hanging over the whole system. Somehow or other we have to imbue them with a faith in their activities and a determination to rise to better efforts, to take advantage of the opportunities which month by month and year by year are increasing in number. I for one do not despair of the prospect that again the Austraiian railway systems might assume the important role that they previously played. As the honourable member for Corio pointed out, we all have a heavy responsibility to see that in the inter-modal transport systems the best advantage is taken of the resources available to Australia. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. </para>

            <para>-The Australian National Railways Amendment Bill before the House proposes a series of amendments to the Australian National Railways Act which take up the agreements that have been entered into at this point between the Australian National Railways Commission and the various trade unions with members employed by the Commission, together with a couple of other minor adjustments to the Act that probably should have been made with the 1975 amendments. The Opposition supports the Bill. We shall support the amendment that the Minister will be bringing forward at the Committee stage. That has been brought forward at our instigation, once again to fill up a loophole which, after all, the best draftsmen sometimes overlook. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Before dealing with the BUI at greater length I wish to refer to some of the amendments now proposed. One deals with contracts. In the 1975 agreements the Commissioner of Railways was required to get the Minister&#39;s approval for contracts entered into, for both the carriage of goods and the purchase of goods or equipment. We do not oppose the amendment but I think the provision should be watched, particularly that section dealing with the Commission entering into contracts for the carriage of goods. I do not agree that the provision was omitted by an oversight. As far as I am concerned it was left in the legislation deliberately so that the Minister could have the right of overseeing, if need be, large contracts for the carriage of goods. We will not oppose the deletion of this provision but the result Will be watched with interest to see its effect. </para>
          <para>We support the agreements that have been reached on superannuation, retirement, appeals and all these matters. I am disappointed that at present there are still 24 unions in the Australian National Railways system. I make an appeal to the trade unions to endeavour to reduce that number, to bring about amalgamations within the industry, because I believe it is to their advantage and to the advantage of the transport industry, the Australian National Railways and the railway system as a whole. There are far too many trade unions in Australia today. It took the various unions associated with what is now the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union years of agitation within those unions to bring about amalgamation. I can recall as a young man joining the Boilermakers Union before the War. Even in those days there was talk about amalgamation. It never seemed to get any closer and then all of a sudden it clicked and the amalgamation of a number of unions has taken effect. I think this is a great advantage to industry and to the unions. Every honourable member on the Government side who has spoken in this debate has made reference to the fourth paragraph of the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But that does not mean we were happy with the arrangements made. In fact I have made it very clear that in my opinion the Whitlam Government was taken to the cleaners, whilst the 2 State Premiers laughed all the way to the bank. </para>

          <para class="block">We entered into an agreement with our eyes wide open. We knew what we were doing. As far as we were concerned, the agreement was one which was mutually entered into. There was no arm twisting. There were no standover tactics. It was an agreement what was mutually entered into between the then Prime Minister and other Federal Ministers and the State Premiers and their Ministers. I ask the supporters of the Government: What are the South Austraiian and Tasmanian governments? I thought they were part of Australia. I thought that the money that was paid to those State governments helped and assisted the people of those States. From time to time, I have read in the Budget Papers of sums of something like $360m going overseas to aid people there. So, why is the Government bitching about paying a little bit of money to Australian States to help them to get over their financial problems at that time- and they did have financial problems at that time? The offer of the Labor Government was not made only to South Australia and Tasmania; it was made to all of the States. As far as handouts are concerned, is the Minister for Transport losing any sleep at night over the superphosphate bounty that he collects? Is the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> handing back the $5,000 a year that it is worth to him? </para>

              <para>-The honourable member was the chief agent of the Central Intelligence Agency in Western Australia; so he should not start to interject. The honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> dealt with him last night. The position is that the money to which I have just made reference is being paid out to private individuals and companies. All of this money went to the people of South Australia and Tasmania. Why does the Minister not tell the truth when he talks about going on with the agreement? The Fraser Government tried to undo the agreement but the agreement was well and truly sewn up by the Labor Government. The Fraser Government has not been able to undo one of the many things that we put through in relation to transport. It has not been able to upset one of them in the High Court. Everything that we did was done legally and constitutionally. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>A limited amount of time is left to me and I do not want to be side-tracked about payments by the CIA to the honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martyr).</inline> The facts of the matter are that transport is one of the major industries in this country. It represents 10 per cent of the gross national product. The expenditure on transport in 1975-76 was something like $4,500m. Transport provides employment for something like 35 000 people or 6 per cent of the total work force. So when we are talking about transport we are talking about one of the most important industries in this country. It is an industry that has a major effect upon the cost structure of other industries throughout Australia. Time and time again industries complain that they are not competitive with imports because of the freight charges within Australia. We have to do something about that. The same can be said as far as export freight rates are concerned. The Australian Shippers Council is continually complaining about freight rates. So transport does have a major effect upon the production and cost structure of this country. </para>
          <para>When the Labor Government came to office it was faced with the task in the transport field of trying to reduce freight rates right across the board throughout Australia and to have each industry accept its true responsibility. We have seen in the transport field one of the most unreasonable misallocations of resources that it would be possible to have in any one country. In the period between the end of the 1939-45 War until we became the Government, the Parliament made available for roads some $3,007m. On the other hand it made available for railways only $248m. In the main, that went into rail standardisation. Let us have a look at the effect of rail standardisation in the one short section connecting Sydney and Melbourne. I give great credit to the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> for the work he did over the years in relation to rail standardisation together with the late member for East Sydney, Eddie Ward. They were great advocates of rail standardisation in this country. In the year prior to standardisation on the Sydney-Melbourne run the total freight carried was 1.27 million tons. In 1965 it had climbed to 1.92 million tons. By 1970-71 it had grown to 2.64 million tons. The $248m for rail standardisation was spent well, not only on the Sydney-Melbourne Une but on other similar rail projects right throughout Australia. There has been a great advantage to the Australian people in more efficient transport as a result of people getting on with the job. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Millar)</inline> talked about the problems in Queensland. The marshalling yards of Brisbane are an utter disgrace to the Queensland Government. For a long period that Government has refused to do anything about them. It has refused to accept any of the reasonable offers made by the Australian Government. The Labor Government made a number of offers to the Queensland Government to take over and build a new marshalling yard so that wagons would not lie idle in the yards in Brisbane. With regard to traffic from Melbourne, on a number of occasions single voyage permits had to be issued for the carriage of Australian freight in foreign ships because the Victorian railways would not make rolling stock available to go to Brisbane as it lay up there for unreasonable times due to the inefficiencies of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen&#39;s</inline> Government and the harm he does to this country, in particular to its railways. </para>

              <para>-It is a banana republic, as the honourable member says. The Labor Government was faced with the responsibility of what was happening at that time to railways in Australia. In 1971 there was a capital investment in railways throughout Australia of approximately $2, 100m. The annual turnover was $584m. In the 5-year period to 1971-72 the railways collectively lost in the vicinity of $340m. Grants, concessions and the like cost State governments another $3 10m, so that in that 5-year period the railways of Australia were losing approximately $650m. At present Australian railways are losing that amount almost annually because of their state and the need to build them up. We were faced with that responsibility. The Labor Government pledged to do something about transport, to reduce freight rates and to make rail traffic more attractive to industry so that it could get on with the job. The then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> made an offer in his 1972 policy speech to take over all the State railway systems. The true picture is that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte had made an offer to John Gorton when he was the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> said: &#39;You can have our railways.&#39; Not to be outdone, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Asian said: &#39;You can have the New South Wales railways as well.&#39; When the Whitlam Labor Government put the proposition to them <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte would not be in it but the New South Wales Government agreed to enter into discussions. Those discussions went on right up to early 1975, when the prize idiot of New South Wales, Tom Lewis, was elected Premier of that State. Honourable members opposite know as well as I do what the Liberal Party as a whole did to him later. It kicked him out; it stabbed him in the back during the night. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The New South Wales Minister for Transport at that time agreed in private discussions with me that the New South Wales railways should be transferred to the Australian Government. I asked him: &#39;Before we sit down to enter into discussions, are we wasting our time?&#39; The answer was: &#39;No, you are not wasting your time&#39;. He said: &#39;I am confident that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Askin will agree to the transfer&#39;. The same applied in Western Australia until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court was elected Premier. The Western Australian raU system would have been transferred to the Australian national raU system. The former Labor Government in Western Australia was prepared to go along with a transfer of State railways as was the South Australian Government in the middle of the continent, and one of the eastern States, New South Wales, under a Liberal Government, likewise would have gone on with the proposition because it could see the advantages of having one Australian system of railways like that in Europe. The best railway system in the world is in Europe. All the European Economic Community works together with Switzerland and Austria. The railways of these countries are part of what is virtually an integrated rail system. In Canada there are 2 raU systems. One system is run by the Canadian Federal Government, not by a series of provincial governments, and the other is run by a private company. These countries realise the advantages of having one rail system instead of a federal system and six State systems. </para>
          <para>The decision of the Whitlam Government to take over State railways was one of the most progressive decisions ever made on raU transport in this country this century. If the Minister for Transport wants to improve transport he needs to do more than he is at the moment. He is only carrying on the initiatives that the Labor Government started. He has not introduced one transport initiative in the 18 months he has been Minister. He has only carried on the programs which the Labor government left him. He has even demolished a few Labor initiatives such as the Road Safety and Standards Authority. He did that at a time when $ 1,000m a year is lost to the country because people are killed and maimed in road accidents. He demolished this </para>
          <para class="block">Authority that was set up following a recommendation made to the Labor Government by a committee set up by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government, namely, the Expert Group on Road Safety. This committee recommended an authority which the Minister has since abolished because it was set up by the Labor Government. The  Chairman  of the Authority said to me on one occasion: &#39;The Liberals could have done it and did not. You could have done it and you did&#39;. That is the difference between the Labor Party in government and the Liberal Party. The Liberal Government wants to demolish everything. It does not want to enter into its responsibilities and get on with the job of providing a better rail system. </para>
          <para>Throughout Australia today there are various government systems and various railway gauges. The gauge in Queensland is 3 feet 6 inches, while it is 5 feet 3 inches in Victoria and part of South Australia. We have the crazy situation of rail exchanges and all the rest of it. The Minister should get on with the job instead of getting <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Joy</inline> to bring out a report on the standardisation of the line between Adelaide and Crystal Brook. The Minister is doing his damnedest to pull standardisation apart and to stop those responsible from getting on with the job. When he was a member of the Government previously he could not get an arrangement with the South Australian Government to build the Tarcoola-Alice Springs railway or to bring about the standardisation of the link line between Adelaide and Crystal Brook. We in the Labor Government were able to achieve that in a few months because we adopted a reasonable attitude and the South Australian Government did likewise. In the 18 months that the Minister has been in office he has only slowed down work on the Tarcoola-Alice Springs line to the detriment of people in Central Australia, in Alice Springs, and Darwin. Much the same can be said about the Adelaide to Crystal Brook line. That job could have been well and truly under way by now if it had not been for the bungling of the Minister. </para>
          <para>We support the legislation because it continues to ratify the things which we did in government. It will bring about a better rail system in Australia and a more economical form of transport. The industry will be in a position to provide a more efficient and a much cheaper system of transport. This will help industry in Australia. It will help the people of this country get a better standard of living because that is what cheaper freight can do. It is a most important industry, employing many people and absorbing a great deal of capital in any one year. </para>

            <para>-in reply-I welcome the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> back into the Parliament. In some 18 months in Opposition he has been far too silent. It seems that the Opposition is now starting to get a voice in transport matters. The whole thrust of the honourable member&#39;s remarks was based on an assumption that the Labor Party Government when in power would achieve cheaper freight rates. That was the thrust of what the honourable member said. He said the Labor Party pledged to obtain cheaper freight rates. I remind the honourable member of one freight rate. In 18 months freight rates to Tasmania went up by 67 per cent under the guiding hand for cheaper f reight rates of the honourable member for Newcastle. I have never heard such nonsense in my time in the Parliament. I welcome the honourable member back to transport debates. At least there will be some life in them if he maintains his form. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He talked about the agreement between himself and the Ministers for Transport in South Australia and Tasmania and the Prime Minister and the Premiers of those States. He said that they agreed on these proposals. Of course they agreed. Cannot every honourable member see Premier Dunstan and Minister Virgo laughing all the way to the bank. The fact is that they took you to the cleaners, Charlie, and you know it. Why does the honourable member not admit that? Is it any wonder there was an agreement. It is like having a bad penny and selling it for 20c down the street. Good heavens above! </para>
          <para>All the honourable member for Newcastle did was to buy out the South Australian railways with large sums of money. But did that or will that lead to cheaper freight? It will only lead to cheaper freight rates, having regard to the high recognised capital which is now put into the system, if the Australian National Railways can, by having a cold, hard look at the system, achieve more efficiency. It is no thanks to the honourable member for Newcastle if that is secured because he paid a high price for the system. As for the price he paid for the Tasmanian system, I think the less we say about that, the better. The honourable member said that he made an offer to all States. But with the other States he did not get to the dotted line on the cheque. He was over generous to his Labor confreres in South Australia knowing that they had a couple of elections coming up. He wanted to buy them out of trouble. But he did not get to the dotted line on the cheque with Victoria and New South Wales. What else did he do while he was being so generous to the railway system in South Australia? In a 3-year road program he cut support to shires in Victoria from $ 16.1m in the last year of my program to $4.7m in the third year of his program. That is how the honourable member financed his railway system. </para>

              <para>-No, it was not the Bureau of Roads report at all. I suggest that the honourable member have another look at the figures. He went far beyond the Bureau of Roads report. He complained because we reintroduced the superphosphate subsidy, totally ignoring the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission recommended its continuation. But because of some blind prejudice or blind ideological hang-up and using <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs</inline> as an axeman, the Labor Government cut out more assistance to industry, which is the fundamental starting point for the development of this country, than did any government in 30 years. That was the sorry record. All this was done so that he could give the Premiers of South Australia and Tasmania a golden handshake. I freely confess that I tried to get out of the agreements. The taxpayers were done in the eye by the golden handshake that the ex-Minister gave to those 2 States. I think the less he says about these matters the better. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One other point I should make is that the honourable member for Newcastle accused me as Minister of taking over his programs and having no initiative at aU. He ignored the fact that the national highways program was laid on his doorstep when he came into office in 1972, and all he had to do was institute it. He ignored the fact that the urban transport program was a report that was lying on my desk ready for him to pick up and implement when his Party came into power. He ignored the fact that in the road safety area I had had a study done which recommended setting up an authority, and all he did was pick it up and implement it. I cannot think of one separate initiative, apart from buying out with a golden handshake the railways in South Australia and Tasmania, that the exMinister ever took. However, I welcome him back to the debate. </para>
          <para>Yesterday several members raised a number of questions which need answering. The honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris),</inline> who led for the Opposition, asked why we had cancelled the second rolling stock program for 800 wagons. I should tell him that the cancellation followed advice to a meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council from the raU group which had been considering the matter and believed that the order was not required at this stage. I trust that answers the honourable member&#39;s query. He also asked why the Australian National Railways annual report for 1975-76 had not been tabled. Again, this relates to the complication of having taken over the South Australian and Tasmanian systems, which are still being operated by the States on behalf of the Australian National Railways. Their annual accounts are prepared and are then subjected to State audit. The Commonwealth AuditorGeneral has requested that composite accounts be prepared covering the total system, and there has been a problem m the valuation of assets for transferred equipment and buildings, particularly in South Australia, where the problems were magnified because of the SPlit between metropolitan and non-metropolitan railways. This work is nearly completed, and the report is close at hand. I hope that I will be able to present it to the Parliament within the month. </para>
          <para>The honourable member raised the question of raU electrification by Sofrerail, and that matter was also raised by the honourable member for Newcastle in a question to me in the House the other day. A report has been received and distributed to State Transport Ministers and aU raUway commissioners and Will come under consideration in the normal ATAC forum. </para>

The honourable member and I had a decent joust when I sat on that side of the House and he sat on this side. I think it only fair that he be given a chance to joust back. The honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis)</inline> raised the question of the increase in the Leigh Creek coal freight rate. He would know that the coal has been carried for a number of years at a loss. The freight rate negotiation has been going on for a number of years. Indeed, it may have  Deen  carried on through the period of my predecessor. Certainly I have been pushing as hard as possible to get a sensible freight rate. Negotiations are still going on, and only today I met with the South Australian Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hudson,</inline> to discuss the matter further. The honourable member also asked about the possibility of selling off houses owned by ANR in Port Augusta to the retiring employees who are occupants on retirement. </para>

              <para>-All employees, if you like, but the answer is still the same. The ANR does subsidise its houses which are let to its employees and has indicated in the past that the provision of housing at a low rental is an inducement to securing the employees it wants there. If it lets the houses go from the stock it would have to build more and therefore is unable to agree to the proposition put forward by the honourable member. The question of <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payments to the Port Augusta Council in lieu of rates was raised by the honourable member for Grey. I should point out that the ANR basis of <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payments in lieu of rates is for full rates when ANR residences front council streets, and 66% per cent of full rates when residences front streets owned by and maintained at cost to the ANR. They also pay road moiety charges on top of that. In respect of properties used for functional purposes, such as workshops, stations and marshalling yards, the Australian National Railways is not required to pay rates and this is consistent with the practice in relation to other Commonwealth instrumentalities. I thank honourable members for the contributions they have made. I will have the debate combed through and if other points were raised which I have missed I will get an answer to the honourable members who raised them. I shall move at the appropriate time the amendment suggested by the Opposition. </para>

Because that matter is dealt with in the by-laws and the by-laws as set out in this amendment are not before the Committee, the amendment that the Minister will move later in the Committee stage will in one way provide the mechanism to enable the Parliament to inspect the by-laws before they finally come into effect. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The other matter I raise in respect to that is that the unions and the South Australian Government have not yet seen the draft by-laws. Therefore, I seek from the Minister information as to what stage the draft by-laws are at and when it is expected that they will be available for examination by the parties concerned. As he can appreciate, it is a matter that is quite important to the employees who are transferring from the 2 State railway systems to the Australian National Railways Commission. </para>
          <para>The matter I raise in respect of clause 1 3 is that employees of the South Australian railways have as a condition of their employment the right to optional retirement at age 60 years. Section 54 of the principal Act that is being repealed provides for a retirement at age 60 years, with the permission of the Commissioner. Again, I understand that the procedures likely to be followed there are that the conditions of retirement, and whether or not there will be an optional age of retirement at age 60 years, will be covered in the common code that is to be established by the Commission. For the benefit of the transferring South Australian employees, I seek the Minister&#39;s assurance that those employees who have that optional entitlement to retire at age 60 years will have that right preserved in the drawing up of the code in order to preserve their entitlement. </para>

            <para>-Before I call the Minister for Transport, I want to say one thing. I have been extremely disappointed at the standard of behaviour in the Parliament. I point out to honourable members that there is such a thing as good manners. It might be said that what I am about to do is like a parson preaching in a church to his congregation- I am preaching to the converted. But knowing what happens in this place, I expect that my remarks will be spread to other honourable members. I ask that honourable members give consideration to this. Members are entering the chamber and crossing in front of the member who is speaking and the  Chairman.  I hope they would not do this in their own homes. The level of conversation is such that sometimes honourable members who are speaking, particularly members whose voices are not very strong, cannot be heard. I regret having to say this. But I hope the Committee at the moment and the House itself when we finish dealing with the Bill in the Committee stage will take some note of my remarks that we might have an improvement in manners in the Parliament. I call the Minister for Transport. </para>

          <para class="block">It is quite clear from looking at that section of the principal Act that the practice of the Commission has been that if the employee wished to retire at age 60 years he must have the permission of the Commissioner. In respect of the South Australian employees, as a right of employment they are entitled to exercise an option to retire at age 60 years. The 2 propositions are in direct contrast. I think it is rather important to the members of the South Australian Railways who are transferring and it is also important to the harmony of the arrangements that the Minister should give an assurance that the employees will not be disadvantaged by losing that entitlement. </para>

In moving this amendment to allow the application of the Acts Interpretation Act with respect to by-laws, I point out to the House that it is now normal for by-laws as well as regulations to be subject to the disallowance provisions contained in sections 48 and 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act. The Australian National Railways Act, since its inception in 1917, has not given the Parliament the power to disallow bylaws. This amendment will correct that position to bring the Act into line with both the Australian Coastal Shipping Act and the Australian National Airlines Act. The Government supports the amendment. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition welcomes the amendment. As the Minister pointed out, the amendment provides for the insertion in the Bill of the provisions contained in sections 48 and 49 of the Acts Interpretation Act to replace the old section 4 of the principal Act. That section provides that all by-laws should be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within 30 days after the making thereof. Under that provision there is no opportunity for the Parliament to reject or to disallow the by-laws. The amendment provides an opportunity for points of difference to be discussed or raised before the by-laws come into operation. It gives the Parliament an opportunity to examine them and it provides that very important right of the Parliament to disallow them if the Parliament is so disposed. The Opposition welcomes and supports the amendment. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is two-fold. First, it proposes to cause the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to be treated under all laws relating to rates, taxes and charges of the Commonwealth, States and Territories in the same manner as its private enterprise competitors. Secondly, the Bill proposes to provide the Corporation with greater flexibility in regard to the scope of the insurance offered, in other words, to remove arbitrary restrictions originally placed on insurable loans and approved securities. </para>
          <para>The issue of paramount importance to this Government is, of course, the proposal to remove the so-called unfair advantage the Corporation is supposed to have over its competitors. Originally the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation had no private enterprise competitors when it was introduced in 1964 and, therefore, it was not necessary to take this action. </para>

              <para>-The situation is that, over the years, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation has in fact gained over half of the insurance field. In fact it controls something like 60 per cent of the market. The Mortgage Guarantee and Insurance Corporation of America, which is basically a foreign owned competitor, controls  approximately 25 per cent of the market. We are asked to pay rates and taxes in order to allow foreign competitors and foreign shareholders to compete on more favourable terms. The Australian Mortgage Insurance Corporation controls about 15 percent. </para>

We just have to recall the Medibank fiasco to appreciate the Government&#39;s attitude to government authorities. I said that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was introduced in 1964. My colleague opposite interjected and argued that it was 1965. From 1964-65 to the present the Corporation has accrued reserves of something like $ 12.7m. Now, of course, the Corporation intends to hand back to Treasury, because of back taxes, an amount of $4.5m. </para>

              <para>- The Minister says that is right. But I believe that is a very foolish thing to do. The fact is that at this stage the money should be kept within the housing industry. This money should not go to Consolidated Revenue. This money which is needed by the housing industry in fact can be held in reserve. I hope that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is not recording the attempts of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> to interject in a prattling manner. The fact is that, even under this Bill, the Corporation will be able to invest funds in certain other instrumentalities not only in the housing field but also in other areas, particularly local government. So, do not let us prattle on about what the Corporation can do with its money. We know what it can do with its money. It is not just enough to require the Corporation to begin to pay rates, taxes and charges. The Government has to take responsibility for a large slice of the operating surplus. As I said, the Government is to take this year $4.5m of the Corporation&#39;s available capital. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The other purpose of the Bill is to provide the Corporation with greater flexibility in regard to the scope of the insurance offered and the manner in which the future surpluses can be utilised. These aspects of the Bill are worthy of support. We have been arguing for this type of change for many years now. It appears to me that this Government has at long last taken one step towards recognising the nature of the problems facing the potential home owners in Australia today. <inline font-style="italic">Ad hoc</inline> measures to patch up particularly politically contentious failures in segments of the housing market or to meet the demands of the best organised pressure groups must not continue. In coming to grips with the housing problems in Australia and in developing a comprehensive housing policy, it is essential that fair and equitable objectives be identified. Labor&#39;s objectives, simply stated, are that we believe that each household is entitled to adequate and conveniently located shelter at a price which does not impose too great a strain on its resources. With this in mind, the first objective of the housing policy must be to stabilise the availability of home purchase finance for all groups within the community and to encourage the development of various means of increasing access to home ownership where this is prejudiced by terms on which the home purchase finance is available. There is a variety of means to increase such access which do not require any subsidy. I stress that point. </para>
          <para>I know of many cases both today and in the past in which people within certain fields have faced an extremely difficult problem in trying to obtain finance. We know that people who earn up to 95 per cent of the average weekly earnings receive subsidies. We know that the Government, through its Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, makes money available to the States so that they, in turn, can make finance available to people who earn up to 85 per cent of the average weekly earnings. A great deal of money is advanced through the Home Builders Account. Some 30 per cent of the money that is made available each year is forwarded through terminating building societies. Home seekers receive favourable terms from terminating building societies so long as they do not earn in excess of 95 per cent of the average weekly earnings. I have stressed in the past and I stress it again that those people who earn up to 135 per cent of the average weekly earnings find it extremely difficult to meet the repayment gap- it is a repayment gap situation- particularly single income families. Regrettably, the situation will get worse. I believe that interest rates will rise in the coming year. In fact, interest rates now are being pressed upwards. We know that this is the current situation. We know that the February loan failed and we know that the May loan will fail. We know that the Government is not getting inflation under control and that is a sad situation. I am not trying to make political capital out of this. It is a fact of life. </para>
          <para>The problems facing Australia are difficult. Obviously, in the broader field, there are a lot of drains on the Commonwealth Treasury which is not an unlimited Pandora&#39;s box. Therefore I am not advocating that unlimited subsidies be extended. I do not think that we can solve our problems in that way. I will suggest programs later in my comments. The development of a more flexible approach to mortgage finance is important. </para>
          <para>The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation can now play an important part in improving this access. The Corporation, if it adopts a flexible and imaginative approach, can go some of the way towards overcoming one of the major problems confronting housing in Australia- the problem of the income threshold or the repayment gap. As I said earlier, that difficulty is faced by people with incomes up to 135 per cent of the average weekly earnings, particularly those households with a single income. One major problem facing the people seeking to be home owners and many existing home owners today is access to finance. It is a great problem for them to get their feet on the rung of the ladder. Once they can get their feet on the rung of the ladder, the problem is not so difficult. </para>

The fact is that the Government refuses to table that report. It abolished the Housing Corporation. The Government will not put that report on the table of the House so that the people of Australia can see the suggestions of some of the finest brains in the housing field in this country; for instance, men like Alec Ramsay who is the  chairman  of the Housing Trust of South Australia, Hugh Stretton, who has one of the finest rational minds on housing, and Pat Troy, who was the  Deputy Chairman  of the Housing Corporation and who, on the question of land, has made a more revolutionary contribution to housing and land than any other person in government during our time. I might add that he is still a member of the South Australian Housing Trust. It is because of his driving force that in South Australia land is so much cheaper than it is in any other capital city in Australia. Because of the finance made available by our Government to the Dunstan Labor Government, the South Australian Housing Trust is the major land developer in South Australia, particularly in the outer Adelaide region. In that region land prices are not skyrocketing to the same extent as they are in other areas of Australia. </para>
          <para>The proposals that I am putting forward can be earned out by the conservative and traditional lending institutions. Lending institutions are properly concerned with the security of people &#39;s personal savings. Naturally they tend to lend to &#62;w risk borrowers- borrowers who fall within the 25 per cent to 35 per cent repayment rule. Without guarantees, they are unlikely, as a whole, to grant flexible mortgages such as short repayment mortgages, mortgages carried to a constant proportion of income, capital indexed mortgages, deferred repayment mortgages, short term mortgages based on household income and which are capable of being extended in term if the household income is reduced, and government guaranteed second mortgages. All these matters were examined when we were in government. They were also examined in the first annual report of the Housing Corporation. But, of course, the Minister does not want to deal with these problems. </para>
          <para>The lending institutions cannot be criticised for their caution in granting mortgage loans because of the problems of finance. There are legitimate concerns about cash flows and such institutions prefer the most secure loans. Of course, the wealthy always get the first priority; it is the battlers who really need assistance. The battlers, as I say, consist of that group up to the middle income earners who receive up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. This Government, which is supposed to be a liberal government, which is supposed to represent that middle group of people, is not representing that group. If the middle ground people have been sold out by anybody it is by this Government. </para>
          <para>If we look at income tax indexation we see which group of people are being attacked most. The middle income earners are being attacked, because of this Government. In every submission it makes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission it attacks the middle income earners. They are the ones who are being affected because the very wealthy- the people on high incomes- can look after themselves. The middle income earners are being affected not only in the taxation field but also in housing because this Government has not brought forward any housing policy in the 18 months it has been in office. </para>
          <para>The home ownership income threshold cannot be crossed by a significant proportion of the community unless the degree of nsk seen in them by lending institutions can be eliminated. A national housing policy must be heavily concerned with influencing both the total volume and the distribution of private sector funds for housing. It must do this because the majority of Australians have to depend on those funds for the satisfaction of their housing needs. One means of coming to grips with the problem would be for the Commonwealth to underwrite the risk taken by lending institutions. If the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is imaginative and aggressive it should solve only the insurance aspect- one of the first objectives of housing policy. The stabilisation of the availability of home purchase finance and access to home ownership will remain low until the Government realises that its primary role in housing is to develop policy which is aimed at directing and influencing the supply of money and the terms upon which it is available to meet housing needs. </para>
          <para>Whilst the importance of the housing sector of policies of overall economic management is recognised and whilst we recognise that housing should not be used as a primary tool of economic management and that it cannot be wholly insulated from the varying impact of national economic policies, we feel some measures can and should be taken to secure a stable flow of funds to specific areas of need. I have developed this thesis at length elsewhere and shall quickly summarise it now. We on this side of the House argue that the extent to which the Government intervenes in the housing market should be such as would assist those in particular need. To achieve this it is our intention, on our return to government, to establish an Australian housing corporation. Its main aim will be to secure the levels of finance needed to maintain the production and the sale of housing at levels consistent with need and to maintain prices within the means of home seekers. The corporation will be directed towards marshalling resources and directing them through the existing institutionsI stress this point- to those in need of housing. It will not be designed to compete with existing institutions, nor will its policies be designed to do so. </para>
          <para>Unlike the Government, we recognise the need to secure an adequate level of finance. The fact that the Government does not recognise this need is demonstrated in several ways. The Government has missed several opportunities to channel funds to building societies and other lending institutions for lending via flexible mortgage conditions to people confronted by the income threshold. The Government abolished the original Housing Corporation and took back into Consolidated Revenue the substantial funds available to that Corporation. In doing this the Government ignored the recommendations in the first annual report of the Housing Corporation. I stress again that contrary to statutory requirements, this Government has refused to table that report. Apparently these recommendations supported the concept of an institution of the type just described- an institution which secures funds and lends them to existing institutions, which lends them to people in need, that is, to people below the income threshold. I stress again that people in need these days are not just people who receive less than average weekly earnings. They include people earning as much as 135 per cent of average weekly earnings. My view is that this will go even higher in the coming year. </para>
          <para>In the Bill before the House the Government has missed another opportunity. One of the pleasing aspects of the Bill, if I can say something nice about the Bill, is that it gives the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation the right to invest funds in building societies and elsewhere. Of course, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> kept jabbering earlier about what the Government will do with the funds. It is already set out in the Bill in which areas the funds can be used. Quite frankly, I think this is an intelligent approach. The only- if I might use the wordstupid approach to this issue is for the Government to drain $4.5m from these funds and divert it back into Consolidated Revenue. There is an intelligent way in which these funds can be invested in the interest of the housing sector or related instrumentalities. That is what I argue. But the Government, in its wisdom, saw fit to confiscate $4.5m of the funds available to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, funds which should have been channelled into building societies which were prepared to offer flexible mortgage schemes or, if not to the building societies, to the land commissions. The land commissions of New South Wales would love to see this finance flowing to them. It could have been provided to sewerage authorities or to local government authorities, which this amendment provides. </para>
          <para>The Government saw fit not to do this. It saw fit to abolish the original Housing Corporation. It saw fit to ignore the real problems of housing. It saw fit to turn its back on that significant proportion of the community which cannot cross the income threshold. It has aggravated the problems in housing by these and other closely associated issues. This Government&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> monetary policies are the best examples of its failure to examine the need to secure an adequate level of finance for housing needs. These policies have had an erratic effect on the availability of finance. It demonstrates further that this Government has not faced up to the housing issue and has failed to use the mechanisms available to it to influence the policies of lending institutions. It is for those reasons that I believe that while there are positive aspects within this legislation, there are also several negative aspects. Therefore, I ask the House to support the amendment I have moved. </para>

              <para>-They are made in today&#39;s Press by people such as the  President  of the Australian Labor Party and, I might add, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. They are made also by the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. They are made carefully and completely. The Government has in its possession a little bit of hard evidence. It is the only evidence which has so far come to light with respect to this so-called break-in, this so-called Watergate. The evidence to which the Government has access suggests that the Labor Party broke into ASIO, not that ASIO broke into the Labor Party. I have tabled a report by Richard Thomas Ninness, Detective Senior Constable of the Australian Capital Territory Police. This report relates to investigations which he carried out in January 1976. It is a report of 2 separate series of interviews. It becomes quite clear when the facts in this document are studied that there is much doubt about the circumstances surrounding this matter. I think there is early evidence in this document to suggest that far from ASIO breaking into the Labor Party headquarters, the Labor Party broke into its own headquarters. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I am not suggesting a motive but there could have been a motive in the stories around the country at the time about Iraqi breakfasts and involvements of senior members of the Labor Party. As I go into the facts which arise out of the report by the police I think this will become clear. First of all, let us consider this charge that there  has been a break-in. That was not how the matter was put to the police at the time by the Secretary of the Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe.</inline> Today he and the  President  of the Labor Party are suggesting a break-in by ASIO. There was not even a suggestion of a break-in at the time the events were alleged to have occurred. I draw attention to the report of Richard Thomas Ninness. </para>
          <para>I have to report that on Wednesday, 14 January, 1976, Acting Assistant Commissioner Kennedy, received a telephone call from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Combe who is National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party. He stated that during the Christmas break two inner doors leading to the Conference Room, Third Floor, John Curtin Building, which are normally locked were found unlocked by one of his staff. </para>
          <para class="block">There is no question of a break-in; doors are simply found unlocked, in the then words of the National Secretary of the Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Combe. The report goes on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On further investigation by the staff member it was found that a steel cabinet, which was situated in the Conference Room, was lying on its side and a quantity of personal papers belonging to the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> were found to be missing, possibly stolen. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is interesting to note that many conflicting explanations are given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> and members of the Labor Party&#39;s staff as to why documents might or might not have been removed. We start with this explanation in the interview by Detective Ninness: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Marks</inline> discovered that the door leading to the section of the building which is occupied by the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> and other members of his staff . . . was found to be closed and unlocked. It was also discovered that a filing cabinet in the Conference Room was found lying on its side and the bottom drawer had been pulled out and the contents of this drawer had been removed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Marks</inline> reported this incident to him on the S January 1 976. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That was about 2 weeks before the matter was reported to police. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>She stated that the reason for the delay in reporting the matter to him was that she assumed that the subject filing cabinet had been laid on its side and the papers removed from it by a member of the Labor Party &#39;s staff. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe&#39;s</inline> colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Marks,</inline> assumes not that ASIO had taken the papers but that a Labor Party staffer had taken them. That is one explanation in the police report as to who took the papers, who raided the Labor Party headquarters. The first explanation is that a Labor Party staff member raided Labor Party headquarters. Another suggestion in the report is: </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline>informed me that the subject filing cabinet was used by Lorraine Dwyer, personal secretary of the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and had been removed from Parliament House and stored in the Conference Room in John Curtin House on 1 1 December 197S, whilst waiting for office space at Parliament House.

              <para>-Ninety. The report goes on:   a large quantity of cardboard boxes, all of which contained papers relevant to the Labor Party. This particular filing cabinet contained personal papers of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s which were in the bottom drawer. He went on further to say - </para>

          <para class="block">I repeat those words. They were of a highly confidential nature pertaining to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s political career&#39;. One is led to ask: Did these papers relate to Iraqi breakfasts, loans or other such matters? It having been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> in this interview that these papers were of a highly confidential nature pertaining to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s political career, we read on and find, later in the interview, as reported by the detective that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> said that the papers were of no significance or no importance. He seems to have changed his mind. The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>After <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> had indicated to me the position where the cabinet was found, we then returned to his office where a further conversation was carried out in relation to the subject matter. When asked if he could be more explicit as to the nature of the papers which were stolen, he then stated that at this stage, he could not answer that because he did not know if, in fact any papers had been stolen or mislaid at all. When asked if it would be possible to ascertain what papers had in fact been taken, he stated that he would be unable to say at this time. He went on to say that if any papers had been stolen from this cabinet, they would be of little value, if any at all, to the person or persons responsible for taking them. Further conversation was had in relation to what papers had been stolen and also their value relating to political matters, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> could not give any definite answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> was asked why the matter was not reported to the police as soon as he became aware of the alleged offence and he stated that he didn&#39;t think it important enough to report. He stated further that he reported it after conferring with his colleagues. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So in one breath <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> is saying that the matter is of a highly confidential and important nature. In another breath he is saying that the matters are of small moment and not sufficiently important to have been reported to the police. Further, he said that he had only reported the matter after he had conferred with his colleagues. We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Dwyer,</inline> goes still further at another point in this document. Page 3 of this police report states:  . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Dwyer</inline> stated that if it had been correspondence belonging to her, it would have been possibly papers relating to policy matters, or of a light nature and definitely not personal data relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline></para>
          <para class="block">So <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s secretary is now saying in that part of the report that the papers were definitely not personal data relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> So we have the situation where the matter was not reported to the police. It appears on the evidence of the police report that this was not even a break-in; but a door was found open. We have, on the evidence of the document, Australian Labor Party staff members, including the most senior members of the organisation, giving entirely different explanations as to both the importance of the papers and whether or not they related to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> It is quite clear that the situation was not reported for some time. On the evidence there was no report until after the offending cabinet had been repaired. At point after point we find that the statements which have been made in the Press today are entirely without foundation. </para>
          <para>Another vital point relates to the suggestion about the role of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It is a most serious charge to suggest that ASIO has been acting in the interests of a political party or at the direction of any political force in this country. It is not without interest and relevance to this subject matter to note that today the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam)</inline> supported the new security arrangements which were announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his major statement on this matter today. It is utterly inconceivable that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney</inline> who, at the relevant time, was head of the security intelligence organisation or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, would do anything improper. I think that all the remarks made today by the Leader of the Opposition would support that proposition. It is quite incredible that these charges have been made by senior Labor Party spokesmen on the very day on which the Leader of the Opposition agreed with these new arrangements. I point out to the House that we have spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney,</inline> the Director-General in charge of ASIO at the time. I remind honourable members that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahoney</inline> was appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and he has said that the organisation knew nothing about it. </para>

            <para>- In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> might I set out the sequence of events tonight. The Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> came into the chamber tonight and sought leave for the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> to make a statement. The Leader of the House gave no information about the contents of the statement. I asked him whether he had spoken to the Manager of Opposition Business about the matter and he said he had not, although he had sought to locate him. I asked whether 2 hours notice had been given and the Leader of the House said that it had not. Then I asked whether there was a written statement and he said there was not. That is what happened on such a serious matter at this late hour; at a time when the Parliament is going into recess for at least 2 weeks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>False allegations have been made by the Minister for the Capital Territory. I take it, and I say this in all seriousness, that the Minister had a clearance from the Cabinet to make a statement on security at this time, something which normally the Government of the day refuses to do. Do I take it that because the Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party, came into the House and gave a clearance for this junior Minister to make a statement on security that we can expect the Government, at any time when serious allegations have been made, to make a statement about security? Do I also take it that when people give evidence to the police, and particularly the police in the Australian Capital Territory, that evidence might be quoted accurately, or in some cases falsely, in the House by a Minister of the Fraser Government? To what level will the Government stoop to use such information, slurs and innuendos? </para>
          <para>Let me examine how this whole matter came about. The headline in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> reads: &#39;Australia&#39;s Watergate&#39;, &#39;Gough&#39;s files raided by ASIO&#39;. It is well known that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Murdoch,</inline> the publisher of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror,</inline> is a close personal friend of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> We know that the same. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Murdoch</inline> is a strong supporter of the Government. In every way possible he has maligned and slurred the Labor Party. He has misused and twisted and turned the Party&#39;s policies, completely distorting them in every way. Let me read what the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> states under the byline of </para>
          <para class="block">Trevor Kavanagh, the head of the bureau of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> here in Canberra. After &#39;Australia &#39;s Watergate&#39;, &#39;Gough&#39;s files raided by ASIO&#39;, the article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Break-in to photograph documents. </para>
            <para>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been blamed for a Watergate-style break-in at the Labor Party &#39;s national headquarters in Canberra just after the 1 975 election. </para>
            <para>Security sources in Canberra say ASIO agents entered the premises at night and forced open a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline></para>
            <para>They then photographed the documents and replaced them. </para>
            <para>It is understood that because of this the Government was able to threaten this week to table a list of allegedly stolen documents in Federal Parliament. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now let us put this matter in perspective. The Minister alleged that the Labor Party had done this. That was dishonest of the Minister. The allegations are published in an anti-Labor newspaper- and the allegations are made by the Murdoch Press. The Minister tried to draw on what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> as saying. I do not know exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> said. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Combe</inline> said. It was only while the Minister was speaking that this newspaper was handed to me and I can only refer to what is stated in it. In part this is what it says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When told of the allegations today, the  President  of the ALP, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> said: &#39;I believe what you are saying is true&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> is quoted as saying. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Combe, the Australian Labor Party national secretary, is reported as having said &#39;the ASIO link did not surprise him&#39;. I assume that both men were informed by the correspondent of what was published in this newspaper and were just concurring with it. It is their belief and the belief of a lot of people in Australia that ASIO is involved in political affairs. Speaking on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House there have been no allegations by the leadership of this Party that ASIO should be used by governments in political matters, particularly against other political parties. I know that individual honourable members can make allegations against governments, against ASIO and against other security forces operating in Australia but never has the Labor Party used this subject in the way that the Government is using it now. </para>
          <para>What really concerns me is that a Minister, even of the lowly level of the Minister for the Capital Territory can come in here with the full authority of the leadership of his Party and suspend Standing Orders so that this statement could be made. It was not a prepared or written statement. The Minister spoke off the top of his head and I want to know as the Deputy Leader of the Party on this side of the House whether he is speaking for the Cabinet or the Government. From now on will security matters be allowed to be used in politics? Will Ministers be able to use these matters as they have been used tonight? It is an utter disgrace. But what is good for the goose is good for the gander. </para>
          <para>So that we can get the matter clear I ask that this article published on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para>-On 18 May 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bill</inline> Brown warned that the then United States Ambassador, Marshall Greene, was in Australia to protect American financial interests and to ensure the maintenance of that country&#39;s military installations in Australia. He was condemned and repudiated by one member of his Party for daring to question the motives of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Greene.</inline> However, I had a very good reason for taking his warning seriously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Greene</inline> called at my Canberra office in July 1973, accompanied by the United States Labour Attache, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ed</inline> McHale. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Greene:</inline> &#39;What would your country do if Australia were to take over the subsidiaries of multi-national corporations in Australia?&#39;. I guess that the question was unexpected, but his instant reply was: &#39;We would move in&#39;. &#39;Bring in the marines, like?&#39;, I challenged. &#39;Oh, no&#39;, he answered me: &#39;The days of marine diplomacy are over&#39;. I asked: &#39;Well, what do you mean by &#34;move in&#34;?&#39;. He mentioned trade, but when I reminded him that that would be his loss more than ours he remarked that there were other things that his country could do. What did he mean? Was he threatening to destabilise our economy, as was done in Chile, Greece and Guatemala, or was he threatening to arrange for the Central Intelligence Agency to organise a coup of some kind as it had done after the completion of destabilisation of Greece, Chile, the Congo, Iran and other countries? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Subsequently I repeated this conversation in the presence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McHale</inline> and his successor in the Lobby Restaurant just before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McHale</inline> returned to the United States, and he did not correct a single point of my recital of that conversation. So here we had the Ambassador of the United States threatening a Minister of State of a friendly country with interference in its internal affairs should its democratically elected government ever receive a mandate to take over the investments of American private corporations. Can anyone imagine any Australian Government feeling obligated to take such action in the event of some Australian investor losing his assets in another country? </para>
        <para>I raise this matter in the Parliament of Australia because I want the United States Ambassador to see that  President  Carter is informed of our apprehension about CIA activities in our country. I want  President  Carter to know that there is a genuine bond of friendship between our 2 countries which is unparalleled perhaps in any other countries in the world. I watched and admired Governor Carter throughout his presidential campaign and I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cyrus</inline> Vance in the Australian Ambassador&#39;s New York residence of my fervent hope that he would win that election. I believe that  President  Carter will emerge as the greatest American  President  in history, even greater than Abraham Lincoln. He will be great because he will give America clean government and thus restore to the American people a pride and self-respect that slowly has been slipping from their grasp. He will be great because he will keep the CLA out of the internal affairs of other countries, especially allies like Australia. In this way he will not only win the respect of all Americans but also he will gain the deep admiration and respect of the people of all other countries of good will. I conclude by wishing the new  President  every possible success in the earnest endeavours that I know he is making to clean up the system of CIA interference in other countries, especially countries like ours that have a friendly relationship with his country. </para>

          <para>- I want to draw the attention of the House to a local newspaper in my electorate, the Campbelltown district <inline font-style="italic">Star</inline> which, in its latest issue, points out that the growth of Campbelltown and the activities of the Macarthur Development Board could be halted. The newspaper reveals that a New South Wales State Government report could spell the end of the residential and industrial growth of Campbelltown. I believe that this very significant matter ought to be drawn to the attention of the House because the implications of this report on the environment and on the future of the Macarthur Growth Centre as seen by observers, according to the newspaper, are tremendously frightening. Briefly, the report says that a large part of that development should not go ahead. This is development which to a considerable degree was financed by the previous Federal Administration. Many millions of dollars have been poured into industrial development in particular in this beautiful area, and this was a sensible decision in the light of providing jobs for people who move out there. Many .millions of dollars have been poured into this area which is now shown by this New South Wales State Government official report to be an area in which dangerous pollution will follow as a result of such development. The newspaper points out that on the one hand the State Government is pouring millions of dollars into the development of the area and, on the other hand, a department of that Government comes to the conclusion after a long, detailed and, no doubt, expensive study, that it is all happening in the wrong place. I have a copy of the relevant sections of that report, along with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paul</inline> Landa, MLC, the New South Wales Minister for Planning and Environment. He says that the report sets out clearly and cogently the vital need to relate Sydney&#39;s urban development to the capacity of its waterways to cope with urban wastes.  His  statement goes on to say that as far as practicable future urban and industrial growth should be concentrated where sewage could be channelled into ocean outfalls and at the same time acceptable alternatives to ocean outfalls should be examined. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>According to the local newspaper, the essence of the matter is that the gravest blow to Campbelltown &#39;s continued development came from the suggestion that industrial development should be diverted to other areas. It states that industrial and commercial development which produced toxic effluents, high volume discharges of high strength or coloured wastes should be discouraged in areas likely to drain to inland treatment works and inland streams. In particular, it pointed to the dangers, the risks, that would emerge to the Georges River system as a result of industrial development of that nature in Campbelltown and also to excessive suburban growth in that area. </para>
        <para>Yet the previous Federal Government, without making such a study and without concerning itself with the implications and the consequences to the environment of such development, poured multimillions of dollars of taxpayers&#39; money into such development. I think it is an indictment of the former Minister for Urban and Regional Development, the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> that he should spend multimillions of dollars on such development which may well rove to be disastrous, according to this New South Wales Government report. I urge the New South Wales Government to decide whether or not it intends to implement the recommendations of that report. Multimillions of dollars of further development are involved. As a consequence, the Federal Government is still committed. It is an absurd situation when a State Government report recommends so strongly against development in an area in which multimillions of dollars of Federal funds are involved. </para>

          <para>- I raised during an adjournment debate in this place some time ago the matter of the accident that occurred adjacent to the Cairns Airport on 23 October 1975 when a Heron aircraft DH1 14 2E/A1 crashed on approach to that airport. I called on the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> at that time to hold a full board of inquiry into the circumstances associated with the accident. I do not propose to repeat what I have said on 3 previous occasions in this place about the circumstances associated with the accident. I raised the matter again just recently and the Minister asked me to confer with him on the circumstances associated with the accident. I did that. After conferring briefly he suggested that I should meet some of the officers of his Department, including the First Assistant Secretary of the Accident Investigation Branch. I had that meeting with those people today. It lasted for almost 2 hours, being interrupted at one stage by the calling of a division in this place. Having discussed the matter with them in detail, I regret to say that I cannot accept the Minister&#39;s decision that a full board of inquiry should not be held. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>A coroner&#39;s inquest was conducted into the accident. Let me indicate to the House the interest taken by the relatives of the 3 crew members and 8 passengers who lost their lives. All the relatives of the people who lost their lives, with the exception of one, attended the inquest which extended over a period of 4 to 5 days. A great amount of evidence was taken and a great amount of argument was advanced. Clearly the relatives of the people who lost their lives were concerned about the circumstances of the accident in which so many people were killed. The Minister&#39;s assertion that there is no real concern is not borne out by these facts which are available to him in his Department. </para>
        <para>Officers of the Minister&#39;s Department tried to explain to me why it was not necessary to hold an inquiry. There is obviously a blank spot in respect of what happened at the time of the accident. A minute before the accident the aircraft should have been flying at about 640 feet. Evidence was given by eye-witnesses, two of whom have a particularly keen interest in aviation. One is a lady who sits on her verandah and watches through a pair of binoculars aircraft approach. </para>

            <para>-I would not say they are sticky-beaks. They are people who are interested in aviation. They were first-class witnesses who were able to give opinions to the investigators. They stood by their points of view. It is clear to me that in that last minute the pilot just did not know where he was. He was not operating in conformity with the regulations under which he had been taught to operate. Having that in mind and having in mind the evidence that was given by people who attended the coroner&#39;s inquiry, I once again appeal to the Minister to have this matter resolved by a full board of inquiry so as to ensure that not only is justice done but also that it is seen to be done. </para>

          <para>-Several weeks ago in this House I raised the question of television reception from the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s Channel 5a in the Newcastle and Hunter River area. No improvement in television viewing has been recorded since that date in the Hunter. Last Friday week an engineer, who was supposed to have done technical work in regard to the changeover to Channel 5a appeared on an ABC talk-back station in Newcastle and endeavoured to explain to the people of the Hunter Valley how to overcome their reception problems in respect of Channel 5A. All that he did was to inform the residents of the Valley that they should purchase antennas and have them properly directed to the ABC channel. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The current situation is most unsatisfactory. I know that your constituents, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> who live in the electorate adjoining the electorate of Paterson, are experiencing exactly the same trouble with Channel 5a. All that the people of the Hunter Valley are asking is that the quality of reception they received prior to the changeover be restored. The installation of new antennas is not the answer to the problem. I was in a home on a hillside in Bolwarra Heights last Sunday night and I can tell honourable members that the ABC reception was very poor. The quality of the reception in this area is a disgrace. </para>
        <para>I have received many telegrams from shire councils and local government bodies as well as constituents in the Hunter Valley area asking for action to be taken.

The form that this will take has not been determined but there is scope for selecting from a wide range of items including paintings, tapestries and works in ceramics, glass, metal or other media. court room doors: The two pairs of doors for entering each Court offer the potential to be works of art. carpet emblem: An emblem could be woven into the carpeted area which extends from the Ceremonial Court into the Public Hall. </para>

          </list>
          <para>After this examination had been completed the Australian Government announced a 171/2 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar. The devaluation was accompanied by a change in the exchange rate arrangements involving the adoption of a flexibly administered rate and an indication that this would involve more frequent and smaller shifts in the relationship of the Australian dollar to a trade weighted basket of currencies. While the devaluation has not been taken into account in the body of the Survey, it will clearly change the outlook over the coming year as discussed in pages 40 to 44. Very broadly its main effects would seem to be in the direction of putting upward pressure on the price level, providing some stimulus to demand and improving the current and capital accounts of the balance of payments. Much will also depend on the future stance of policies, particularly monetary policy, which will have to be adapted to the changed situation&#39;. </para>
          <para>Following the devaluation of the dollar on 28 November 1 976 the Government took a number of measures, including monetary measures, directed at preserving the gains for the economy flowing from devaluation. These measures were aimed at sustaining the Government&#39;s basic strategy for economic recovery: a major pre-requisite for the success of this strategy is, of course, the control of inflation. The full range of measures taken and how they fit into the Government&#39;s economic strategy were outlined in my statement in the House on 1 5 February. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The Government&#39;s basic economic strategy has not changed as a result of devaluation. Moreover, it is fully consistent with the medium-term economic strategy adopted by Member countries at the OECD Ministerial Council meeting in Paris last June. This strategy gave top priority to combatting inflation through the pursuit of cautious demand management policies. It is also consistent with the basic thrust of the OECD Survey of the Australian economy of which several elements remain relevant: indeed the Survey drew attention to the consistency of our policies with the OECD medium-term economic strategy. The Survey noted in particular that it was essential that the adjustment of wages to increases in the cost of living should be only partial and that partial indexation would make the transition to a lower rate of inflation both speedier and smoother and would allow a restoration of private sector profit margins which have been seriously eroded in recent years. </para>
