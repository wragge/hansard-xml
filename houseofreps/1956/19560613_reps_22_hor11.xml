            <para>- I have been waiting an opportunity to make a statement on this matter, and I shall make it now. I assure the honorable member that the Prime Minister intends to look into this matter while he is in London. As to the general question of prisoner of war payments, I would like to state that last March the Prime Minister indicated to the House that a distribution of money for ex-prisoners of war  would  not be made by the International Red Cross before mid-1956 at the earliest. The Prime Minister also pointed out that last year the Japanese Government had paid &#163;4,500,0C0 sterling to the International Committee of the Red Cross in  full  settlement of its obligations under Article 16 of the Japanese Peace Treaty. In addition to this sum, the Red Cross also holds 2,500,000 United States dollars which were paid to it by Thailand under an agreement on Japanese assets in Thailand between that country, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The Red Cross cannot distribute these moneys to national agencies, as it has not yet completed its check of the lists of forme;&#39; prisoners of war submitted to it by the countries concerned. Australia, in common with other nations, is rendering the Red Cross all possible assistance to ensure that there is no avoidable delay. The Government has no later advice which would pin-point the possible time of distribution, but I assure honorable members that there will be no avoidable delay on this Government&#39;s part. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Treasurer a question that I wish to divorce entirely from politics. I can only assure the right honorable gentleman that under similar circumstances I would feel it incumbent upon myself to direct such a question to whoever was the responsible Minister of the government of the day. South Australia, like the rest of the Commonwealth, is experiencing an unprecedently cold and wet winter, and in the City of Port Pirie at the present time the lady members of benevolent societies are distributing warm clothing among the unfortunate ones. In view of the forthcoming recess, and the time that it takes to get the necessary machinery working after the House meets once more, will the right honorable gentleman ask his Cabinet to consider the immediate need to increase social service payments? Will he also instruct the departments affected of the advisability of eradicating the repulsive term &#34; pensioner &#34; and of using in lieu thereof a more acceptable definition such as &#34; retiring allowance &#34; ? </para>

            <para>- Yes, that report was released in London very recently. It is the result of an entirely independent study by eminent British scientists, and is very reassuring indeed on the genetic effects of fall-out from nuclear explosions.  Lt  therefore adds great weight to the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockcroft and others whom I have quoted in this House. The report says, in effect, that the risk of genetic harm to future generations from nuclear weapons tests is negligible. It says that, even if these tests were to continue indefinitely at the present rate, an individual would, over a period of 30 years, receive only 1 per cent, of what he would, in any case, receive by way of radiation from natural sources. Indeed, the report makes some recommendation about dealing with every-day radiation from such sources as X-rays and radio therapy. The report does issue a warning of some possible health risks, nothing to do with genetics, which could arise from repeated hydrogen bomb explosions resulting in the release of radio active strontium. It says, &#34; At its present level no detectable increase in the instances of ill effects is to be expected &#34;. But it says further that at the present rate of firing, &#34; We could within the lifetime of some now living be approaching levels at which ill effects might be produced in a small number of the population&#34;. I think I should point out that only a few days ago. in the House of Commons, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Anthony</inline> Eden reaffirmed the British Government&#39;s willingness to discuss methods of limiting test explosions and be said, &#34; This remains the policy of  Her  Ma jesty&#39;s Government, and we would seek every opportunity to put it into effect &#34;. Needless to say, this is also the policy of the Australian Government. </para>

Is it also a fact that the highest reading at Port Kembla compares with 160 tons in some districts of Pittsburgh. United States of America?

            <para>- Will the Minister for Social Services inform me whether it is the intention of the Department of Social Services to proceed with the plan, previously approved by his predecessor, to build premises at Newcastle for a new regional office of the department? If so, is it proposed to extend the duties of the officer in charge of that office by keeping records in, and making the payment of pensions from, that office? Is the Minister aware that, by having such an office in Newcastle, reviews of pensions, answers to the inquiries of pensioners, and many other social services matters, will be able to be expedited considerably? ff it is proposed to erect a new building, what progress has been made with the plan to do so? Has land been acquired, have plans been prepared, and have renders been called ? If not, is the Minister able to inform me when it is expected that a new building will be proceeded with and social services facilities at Newcastle be thereby improved? </para>

            <para>- Lot me say, first, that I know that the offices of the Department of Social Services in Newcastle are at the moment unsatisfactory, that the department is functioning in two buildings, and that the arrangements do not lend themselves to either the quantity or quality of service that we believe the people deserve. It is the policy of the Government to carry out a vigorous programme of decentralization, and to that find the magnificent plans and purposes of my predecessor are being carried out in Newcastle. An area of land has been acquired in Hunter-street, on which it &#60;s proposed to erect a three-story building which will enable us to give to the people of Newcastle, and of the surrounding part of New South Wales, the service that we believe is richly deserved. </para>

If that be the case, will the Acting Prime Minister ask the Prime Minister to confer, on the spot, with the Government of  Indonesia  - which i3 one of the two countries, the other being the Republic of the PhilipDines, which has not completed the necessary formalities to enable the payments to be made to ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese - with a view to having this matter expedited? </para>

            <para>- My question, which is addressed to the PostmasterGeneral, is prompted by a concern which I have felt for some time, and which has been heightened by recent happenings in Canberra. I refer to the employment by the Postal Department in this city of youths aged fifteen and sixteen who come here many miles from their homes, and who, I believe, are subjected perhaps in their boarding establishments, to influences which would be absent in their homes. I ask the Postmaster-General whether it is necessary to employ youths of such tender age at such great distances from their homes, and whether it is true that youths may be employed in post offices at fifteen years of age but may not receive the adult wage until they reach the age of 21, whereas girls may be employed in post offices at fifteen years of age, and, after two years&#39; service and -after obtaining a certificate of competency, may receive the adult wage. </para>

            <para>- I think I know the circumstances which have prompted the honorable gentleman&#39;s question. I realize that it is a subject to which more attention could probably be given, particularly with, the object of providing recreation facilities in the hostels where youths, who, of course, are employed not only by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department but also <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> other departments, are accommodated. As a matter of fact, there is in existence already a scheme designed to provide facilities for directing their activities along beneficial lines outside working hours, but, sometimes, the arrangements made have not been followed. The department finds it difficult to obtain sufficient adult staff for the essential work of letter delivery and similar duties, and it is necessary to employ youths. It is not desirable to employ lads of fifteen years of age at any great distance from their homes, and that is not common practice, although I know it has prevailed in the Australian Capital Territory. The wages paid to junior postal officers are determined, first of all, by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and these officers are paid under the relevant scale of the Public Service Board in accordance with the award. Therefore, that matter is not really within my field pf administration. However. I assure the honorable member that, in the last day or so, I have given some attention to the problem he has mentioned, and that, if I can improve conditions, I shall do so. </para>

            <para>- I know that the honorable gentleman is concerned about this matter because of the very great importance it has for the port of Albany. I think it is at least five years since he brought the problem to my notice first, but, unfortunately, although we have done all we could do in the years since in an effort to stimulate other countries to join the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultive Organization, only seventeen of the required number of 21 nations have yet ratified the agreement. Until the organization comes into existence, the International Load Line Convention cannot be brought into international operation. We shall continue to do what we can to influence individual countries to join the organization, and, when it becomes effective, I shall most certainly cooperate with the Minister for Shipping and Transport in an endeavour to have the present international load line arrangements altered, technically and generally, as we believe they should be altered. This would be very largely to the advantage of the port of Albany. </para>

Chifley, who was the war-time Prime Minister of Australia, passed away. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, as Leader of the Government, he will consider taking steps to honour the memory of this great Australian who served Australia so diligently, faithfully and well in war and in peace. The people of Australia will remember him gratefully, and it would be their wish that something of the nature that I have put to the House to-day be accomplished. The late Jack Curtin is remembered in the School of Medicine at the Australian National University and it would be appropriate, fitting and proper if this House, by action agreed upon unanimously by all sections, were to establish some monument or memorial so that the people whom my illustrious predecessor served might remember him an the years that lie ahead.

I hasten to assure the honorable member and the House that such delays, or the apparent neglect in connexion with them, are not caused by the Treasury nor are they its responsibility. I am personally engaged in an effort to have arrears -cleaned up. Those arrears are caused by bottlenecks and delays in the handling of these claims by other departments that are concerned, and departments that are only too happy to pass the buck and the blame on to the Treasury. </para>

            <para>- I think I should deny that the responsibility for inaccurate weather forecasting lies entirely with the forecasters of the Department of the Interior. I am sure that the honorable member is well aware that in a large country such as ours, meteorologists mustdepend on weather information supplied by all sorts of casual observers throughout the country. Weather reports that come in from the seaward directions are completely inadequate. Our forecasters are obliged to do their best with inadequate information, and I am bound to say that they do very well with it. The honorablegentleman, and, I think, the House, will be pleased to know that better technical aids to weather forecasting are gradually being developed and installed in this country, particularly on the east coast. Everything possible is being done to provide better meteorological instruments, and to extend reporting services so that more information may be provided for the forecasters. For instance, we are encouraging ships at sea to give us fuller information, by promising awards for such information. In general, we ar&#60;striving to do our best, within the resources available to a government department in a big country like Australia, to achieve the sort of results that  the  honorable member hopes for. </para>

            <para>- The arrangement is that the Commonwealth shall bear the entire financial responsibility for the production of the Salk vaccine. That means that the Commonwealth has the responsibility of importing monkeys, setting up special laboratories and paying the salaries of scientists who work in them, and the financial responsibility for. safety testing, both- at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and at the Fairfield laboratories. The Commonwealth also bears financial responsibility for delivery of the finished product to the States. The Australian Government has asked the State governments to administer the inoculation campaigns within their own borders. All the States have agreed to give free treatment, with the exception of New South Wales, where a small charge will be made to all recipients of the vaccine. </para>

      <para>M&#62;. L. R. JOHNSON. - Will the Treasurer consider alleviating the difficulties experienced by the States in mainwining transport services, by exempting such services from their heavy commitments to the Commonwealth in the payment of pay-roll tax? I point out to the right honorable gentleman that New South Wales transport services, for example, last year contributed &#163;1,100,000 in pay-roll tax, and &#34;Victorian services contributed &#163;700,000, while Commonwealth transport services were entirely free of this imposition. Does the Treasurer agree that relief from this extortionate tax would assist the States to continue to provide adequate transport services, in the face of the upward spiralling of costs and the general inflationary situation that has developed during this Government&#39;s period of office? </para>

          <para>- I point out to the honorable member that this Government, during its term of office, has assisted the States to an unprecedented extent, on a completely honorary and voluntary basis. The fact that the States pay pay-roll tax must be considered in conjunction with the fact that the States receive very generous reimbursement grants from this Government under the uniform income tax legislation. On every occasion since this Government has been in office those grants have exceeded the legal entitlements of the States under the agreement entered into between the States and a former Commonwealth Labour government. </para>

            <para>- Has the Treasurer&#39;s attention been drawn to the recent announcements that the accounts of the New South Wales Department of Railways in this financial year will show a deficit, and that great hardship has been caused to the people by consequent increases in fares and freights? Does the Treasurer realize that the adverse balances in the New South Wales Government railways&#39; finances will affect this Government, which will have to provide the money to make good the deficit? Is he aware that that deficit would largely have been avoided if, since the war, the New South Wales Government had used the moneys that it has spent on obsolete steam engines for the purchase of economic diesel-electric locomotives? Is he also aware that if, in addition, loan moneys that have been made available to that State since the war had been suitably allocated, the New South Wales railways would now be out of the red? If he is aware of these things, will he, at the forthcoming meeting of the Australian Loan Council, bring this matter to the attention of the Treasurer of New South Wales and perhaps discuss with him and the Treasurers of the other States a proposal to use part of their loan moneys for the purchase of diesel-electric locomotives? The purchase of these locomotives, which save up to 40 per cent, of their capital cost every year, would enable the aggregate loan moneys made available by the Commonwealth to the States to be kept within reasonable bounds if, particularly in New South Wales, there were some sanity in railway administration. </para>

            <para>- I have little doubt that the obsolescence of locomotives and the run-down condition of the State transport system, particularly the railways, have been a contributing factor in the financial difficulties experienced by the New South Wales Government, which has been assisted to a very generous degree by this Government. I have little doubt also that the State governments will have to give very serious consideration to railway deficits, which unfortunately, in the form of reimbursement grants made by this Government to the State governments, are a burden on the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

A scheme designed to abolish the means test at the age of 65 years would require an additional contribution of 7&#163;d. in the &#163;1 covering all taxable incomes.

          <para class="block">The House will remember that the committee brought down a progress report last October in which it indicated thai evidence in relation to the Department of Civil Aviation had been taken during August, September and October, but that it had not had enough time to draw up a full report. In the progress report, the committee merely pointed to the fact that it had collected all the evidence, and said that that evidence would be available to the new committee. Honorable members will recall that, shortly afterwards, the Parliament was dissolved and, with it, the Public Accounts Committee. Activities could not be resumed until late in the following February, when a new committee was elected. But then, owing to the exigencies of parliamentary business and other factors, the new committee found it difficult to concentrate its attention on the report on the Department of Civil Aviation. That matter had to be put aside while the Supplementary Estimates were being considered. A report on supplementary Estimates was presented later. This is the final report on the Department of Civil Aviation, and the committee presents it unanimously. </para>

          <para>. - The Opposition opposes  the  adoption of this clause. We do so  because  it is a penal provision, and we  do so  with emphasis because the clause  proposes  to impose penal provisions of a  dual  character. We believe that this constitutes a set of circumstances that should&#39; not be tolerated by a free parliament  in  a free country. I remind the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Harold Holt) that when we were dealing yesterday with clause 17 we endeavoured to obtain from him a very clear  indication  of the powers that would be held  by  the authority during a period when it  was  acting under the direction of the  Minister.  We sought to obtain from him then some clue about whether or not clause 21 (6.) did in fact cut down the powers of the authority to the point where,  even  in circumstances of emergency, the authority could  not issue  an order  that was  -contrary to an award of the commission. The Minister, for reasons best known to  him  or his advisers, did not indicate very clearly to this committee the real position in respect of that condition. We did gather from the Minister that a shipping stoppage would be regarded as an emergency, at which point the Minister could  issue  a direction to the authority. </para>

            <para>- lt  could be. I do not put it any higher than  that.  Let us look at the situation where a stoppage occurs somewhere and the authority, in the words of the Minister, could  be  put completely in control. An order then made by the authority under those special powers might well cut across or affect matters already contained in an award of the commission. We have directed attention consistently to the dual control over this industry.  We  now come to the crux of the situation. Will the Minister or those persons in authority later decide which course to follow? The authority may move in, and, because an order is not obeyed, impose a penalty of &#163;250 on an organization, or the other course may be followed under the new industrial arbitration legislation and a fine of &#163;500 may be imposed by the Industrial Court. Before the Minister asks the committee to adopt this clause, will he give us a clear line of demarcation and show us where we are going in matters of that description? We are entitled to know, and the committee as a whole is entitled to know, where the line of demarcation is to be drawn between these two authorities and by whom judgment is to  bc  passed for the imposition of penalties. &#91; ask the Minister quite frankly whether -sub-clause 6 of clause 21 wrote down the power of the authority to the point where  it  could not cut across an award of the arbitration commission. He would not indicate clearly yesterday that that was <inline font-style="italic">so,</inline> and preferred to say that if there were -a strike there might be a situation where the authority would be given the power as a result of the ministerial declaration. Who will decide whether it is a matter that should rightly be dealt with by the authority under this provision, or whether  it  is a matter that contravenes the award and falls within the penal provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? This throws into light very clearly the situation that must arise when we have two authorities which can deal with  the  one matter. If the Minister would only look for a moment at the definitions of the two powers he would be more enlightened. We have, for instance, the presidential commission with powers to deal with all matters or things affecting, or relating to, work done or to be done. This is set out in paragraph (a) of the definition of &#34; industrial matters in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. If we look at the functions of the stevedoring authority as set out in clause 17 of this measure, and relate paragraph (a) to paragraph (/), we learn that the authority may regulate the performance  of  stevedoring operations and -  make arrangements for allotting waterside workers to stevedoring operations so as ti&#62; ensure, as far as practicable, a fair distribution of work in stevedoring operations amongst registered waterside workers </para>

            <para>- First of all, in respect of an emergency, and secondly, in respect of the contravention of an order of either the authority or The arbitration commission. We shall find that the arbitration commission and the authority will be dealing with issues conjointly to such an extent that the decision of one will cut across that of the other.- That can happen even when  emergency  conditions do not exist. In that situation, the authority is empowered to impose a penalty of &#163;250, and the Industrial Court is empowered to give a direction that such and such shall be done. On top of that, there is the contempt penalty of &#163;500. A direction can he obtained under this provision. As a matter of fact, in almost every dispute, that will logically flow from the very conditions of the waterside workers. In  the  main, the disputes on the waterfront occur not over margins or wages, but conditions. We shall have situations in which the order of one authority will cut  ti  cross that of the other, and one of them will be made to look foolish in respect of either the provisions of this clause, or the powers conferred upon the arbitration commission and the Industrial Court. </para>

        <para>I cannot imagine, of course, that the Industrial Court or the arbitration commission will lightly forgo any authority that they might possess. I cannot imagine that the Industrial Court will tolerate the authority moving in on territory that it feels belongs to them. </para>
        <para>I put it to the Minister that whatever the reasons that he may have put forward for bringing into this industry the powers of the arbitration commission in conjunction with those of the Industrial Court, there is no reason why he should allow dual powers in respect of penalties to operate so far as the waterside workers are concerned. Honorable members may analyse the position in any way that they wish. There is no division in respect nf many of the things that are side by side in the powers of both authorities. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to explain the real situation clearly, before we are asked to adopt the clause. The Minister tried to indicate that a certain provision would act in one way and another in another way. I hope he will let us know now what power the authority has in respect of the imposition of fines when its orders are disregarded. H&#60;* might also deal with the matter of contempt and the issuance of orders by tb.6 industrial authority under the other powers that are also contained in th&#187; same measure. </para>

        <para class="block">This is another instance in which I have set out to meet views put to me by representatives of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, and of the federation. It was argued that when the statutory authority could make an order without a proper hearing, it was not proper for its order to be subject to the imposition of a penalty, and further, that where a penalty may be imposed, it should be in respect of an order made following upon a hearing, as is provided in the amendment. I do not propose to chase all the real or fancied difficulties that have been suggested by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E.

        <para>The existing Stevedoring Industry Board has had no clear picture of where its responsibilities began and ended so far as the arbitration tribunal was concerned. Difficulties of a hypothetical kind may doubtless still be raised, but at least we have sought to clarify the respective roles of the two authorities - the arbitral tribunal and the stevedoring authority - and I believe that, in practice, it will work out much more satisfactorily than it has in the past. As I have said more than once in the course of this debate, we must surely assume that the men who will be appointed to the arbitral tribunal and the statutory authority will be men of good sense and sound judgment. If we find that assumption reasonably well based, much of the difficulty to which <inline font-style="italic">r.he</inline> honorable member for Blaxland has referred will be found in practice to have disappeared. </para>

          <para>.- Like my colleague, the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison).</inline> I desire to put some of the views of the Opposition in respect of this clause. First of all, let me stress once again that overlapping is admitted so far as this legislation is concerned. The difficulty, of course, is that this amending bill does not remove the overlapping but, if anything, makes it more pronounced and more certain. T think that the suggestion that I made last evening is the only way in which this difficulty can be overcome. That suggestion was to leave to the presidential commission the question of fixing hours, the minimum or basic wage, and long service leave, and to leave  all other questions to the Stevedoring Industry Authority. As it is, the legislation provides that both the commission, in the arbitration sphere, and the Stevedoring Industry Authority, in its  sphere,  can make awards. Those awards could clash and, as the bill shows, where they do clash, the authority remains predominant, and even the commission cannot change any decisions of the authority without consultation with it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I fear that as the consequence of this bill there will be  complicated  legislation that will be difficult to interpret both on the part of the stevedoring companies and the Waterside  Workers  Federation, apart from the difficulties which the bill, in turn, will cause to the Australian Council of Trades Unions, which is invariably  brought  into these disputes. So, although &#91; appreciate the far-t that the amendment which the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> has moved is an attempt to make this clause a little clearer and that it makes it clear that the provisions of clause 20 will only operate after a hearing carried out- in accordance with clause 18 of the bill, it still does not make this clause a good clause from the stand-point of either the trade union movement or the Opposition. </para>
        <para>Let me point this out: Notwithstanding the amendment which the Minister has moved and which. no doubt, will be carried, there still remains clause of&#62; of the bill which, as the Minister knows and I think the committee now knows, means that whether the authority carries out the provisions of clause IS or not, to the extent that it omits to carry out those provisions, everything that ii does is still legal and enforceable. So the persons who are covered by clause 20 and upon whom penalties can be imposed can have the penalties imposed upon them notwithstanding the fact thai clause 18 (2a.) has not been carried 0U in its entirety. I further point out that we are up against this difficulty: In this particular clause the penalty is &#163;2fin the case of a. waterside worker and &#163;250 in the case of anybody else. </para>

            <para>- Quite so. But as the honorable member for Blaxland has already pointed out, the contempt provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act must be taken into consideration in addition to the penalties imposed in clause 20 of this bill. But what I find most* remarkable is the fact that in clause 20 the maximum penalties are &#163;25 and &#163;250; but in the very next clause, which deals with a state of emergency that can be declared by the Minister and which one would assume would be declared only under the most extraordinary circumstances, the fines are &#163;10 in the case of a waterside worker and &#163;100 in any other case. The Opposition fails to see why there should be a differentiation in the penalties with respect to offences of a similar character. The first penalty is to be imposed under clause 20 in connexion with the disobeying of an order and the second penalty, provided in clause 21, is to be imposed also for disobeying an order, on this occasion an order given under the authority of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- It would appear so. But I point out the inconsistency of the particular fines. As the Opposition has pointed out on more than one occasion, there is a double-barrelled power of fining, and these fines, in these circumstances, must be regarded as excessive. In any case, the Opposition thinks that the clause is a bad clause and that it should be opposed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There are one or two other factors that could well be pointed out in respect of this clause. This clause makes the authority, from the stand-point of any order made by the authority, equivalent to the conciliation and arbitration commission. Whether the wording of the amendment, or the wording of the clause, is intended to imply that the equivalent of the commission is a commissioner or the commission as defined in the interpretations of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is not clear. If the equivalent is the commission, then the commission consists of one presidential member plus two other persons. The commissioner, both from the stand-point of status and powers, has less responsibility and less power than the commission. </para>
        <para>One of the things about which we have to be very careful in legislation of this description, particularly when penalties are imposed, is to ensure that everything we do is very clearly stated. It is not the intention that we express in debate in this chamber that determines the matter; it is the wording that we use in the measure itself that determines what is to be imposed by a tribunal. Because of that fact, one is rather concerned about the hearings which are provided for under clause18 of the bill because there are certain things in connexion with the powers and procedures that could mean that persons would not have a fair hearing in respect of any matter upon which an order was made. I just point out to the members of the committee that clause 18(2b.)(c) provides that the authority may determine the periods of time  in  which a case may be presented; and  if  that period of time does not enable  the  parties properly to present  a  case, then clearly their case will not be properly heard. The same objection can be raised to clause 18 (2b.) (e), which reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Authority may require evidence or views, to be presented in writing and may decide the matters upon which the Authority will hear oral evidence or views; </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The application of that paragraph  may  prevent the cross-examination  and,  generally, the oral examination of persons who have made statements; and  if that  were the case it might mean that  the  case had not been properly heard or  that  the witnesses had not been properly tested. So one sees that we need to be very clear in regard to this legislation, particularly in view of the very high penalties  that  may be imposed. From every standpoint the Opposition feels that this clause is not a good clause and, because  it is not  a good clause, it should be opposed  and  should be rejected. </para>

          <para>.- The Opposition will certainly oppose this clause. For the benefit of the committee, I point out that the clause deals with something that is entirely new in industrial legislation in Australia. The clause will permit the Minister to make a declaration that a state of emergency exists in respect of a port, whereupon the authority may -  for the purpose of the performance of its function under paragraph (6) of sub-section (1.) of section seventeen of this Act, give such directions as it thinks fit. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">So, for the first time in Australian industrial legislation, we have a power conferred on a Minister to declare a state of emergency. Under this legislation one can naturally expect that there will be such trouble industrially that the declaration of a state of emergency will probably be necessary. The point is, I repeat, that here is power, for the first time granted under industrial legislation in Australia, which can have farreaching consequences. I reiterate that I know of nothing in Australian industrial legislation that permits the making of such a declaration by a Minister. The bill does not state the grounds upon which such a declaration may be made. One does not know whether the declaration would be made in the event of a strike at one port or a strike at more than one port, or whether it would come as a consequence of storm, flood, tempest or something else. The position is that a declaration of emergency can be made,, and that immediately it is made therights of the parties, as provided under this legislation in respect of orders, go by the board. There is no necessity, under this clause, for the carrying out of&#34; the provision in clause  18,  that the authority shall consult the parties affectedbefore making an order. Under theprovision in clause  21  the parties simply need not be consulted. It is possible for the authority, without consulting anybody, to make such orders as it may think necessary. These orders may be conveyed to the parties either orally or in&#62; writing. If they are conveyed orally they must be immediately complied with. </para>
        <para>ITo period of time is fixed in respect of the currency of a declaration of emergency. The declaration can have effect for a week, six months, twelve months - indefinitely. It can remain in force for any time that the Minister deems necessary. The rights of the parties are not safeguarded in any direction. Whatever order is given by the authority must he obeyed, and obeyed immediately. Theparties will have no legal power to protest, no power to advance a case for the withdrawal of the declaration of emergency, or for the moderating of the declaration in any way. In other words, it will be possible, under this clause, to establish, a dictatorship on the waterfront - a dictatorship that can giveorders and, if those orders are not complied with immediately, either the waterside worker or the organization or other body concerned is subject to very severe penalties. In addition to the penaltiesimposed in clause  21,  the matter could go before the proposed Commonwealth Industrial Court for an order to be ma.de- by the court, and, if the order was not observed, the contempt provisions could be put into operation. Here we see again the effect of double-barrelled penalties in respect of an offence. </para>
        <para>The remarkable thing about this clause is the silence of the Minister for Labour and National Service. On more than oneoccasion Opposition members have asked: for information about what a state of&#34;  emergency means. Although the Minister has given us that famous courteous smile of his, he still has not responded to even the most reasonable and courteous request for information. That makes us feel that this clause must be regarded with more than ordinary suspicion, and, therefore, I put the views of the Opposition on this matter before the Minister. The clause is a bad one, and there is no justification for it. The Minister has given us no indication why it should be included in the bill, and he has not given us any illustrations of things that have happened in the past that have made it necessary to provide for. a declaration that an emergency exists. As I have stated, for those reasons we think the clause is a bad one, and it should be omitted from the bill. The Opposition will  oppose  it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT (Higgins- Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) f 3.47&#34;) . - It is extremely interesting to hear these emotional protestations about the provisions in this bill from Opposition members who, apparently, have forgotten that the Labour Government introduced in this Parliament legislation dealing with the same subject-matters as those with which this bill deals. Anything the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> has said in criticism of the provisions of this bill could have been said with much greater force against the very much wider and more sweeping provisions included in the Stevedoring Industry Act which the party to which he belongs fathered in 1949. All that the present Government has done in this bill is to trim down very considerably the wide powers which the Labour Government conferred on the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board in 1949, and to make it clear that these wide powers are to be used only in an emergency. So far as Labour was concerned, it was an open go, and the powers could be used at any time without anybody being bothered about the matter. Let us have a look at the provisions of the 1949 act, which apparently commended itself to the present Opposition members who were then in the Parliament. The most sweeping functions were given to the Stevedoring Industry Board by section 13 of that act. I do not need to go beyond the functions set out in paragraph (a) of the section, which gave the board a general power to regulate and control the performance of stevedoring operations. </para>

Under the Labour act, any state is good enough for action against any one in respect of whom the Labour government may have wanted to take action. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of section 13 of the 1949 act gave the board the wide power of regulation and control, and, following on that power, all the other functions are set out in the section.

        <para class="block">That gave the board an open go in the exercise of the most sweeping function? conferred upon it.

        <para class="block">I ask the committee to contrast the  most  sweeping powers that one can conceive which were conferred on the board by the 1949 act with what this Government has done in the present bill. First of all, as to functions, we have trimmed down the regulation and control function so as to make it clear that control can be exercised only in an emergency Opposition members say, in effect, &#34; You could declare martial law. Define  what  you mean by &#39; an emergency &#39;.&#34; I shall not attempt to define an emergency at this point of time. That will be a matter for the Minister of the day to determine at the appropriate time. We say that, whereas, under the Labour measure, there was no limit to the exercise of the power of control, under this bill that power of  control can be exercised only in an emergency. That is a very considerable trimming down of the sweeping power which at present exists. Secondly, we have reduced the occasions on which the proposed Australian stevedoring industry authority may give these directions which will give rise to offences. We go even further. We do not merely provide that the direction, contravention of which attracts a penalty, may be given either orally or in writing. We provide that a copy of a direction given in writing shall be served personally or by post on the person to whom the direction is a;iven. </para>

        <para>Again we get back to what one must keep saying, apparently almost interminably, to Opposition members: Why do they wish to create a straw man every time they discuss a. clause of this bill? Why do they imagine that the responsible people will act in such an unreasonable way that all these hypothetical dangers to which they refer will develop? If there are valid criticisms &#34;of the provisions in this bill on the ground that they go too far, they are criticisms that members of the present Opposition might very well have directed against the much more sweeping provisions embodied in a measure introduced by the Labour government. We believe the provisions included in this clause to be necessary for the effective operation of the measure, and I ask the committee to endorse them. </para>

His  first reason is that, according to his own reasoning, similar provisions were included in an earlier measure, and his second reason is that, for unspecified reasons which he is not prepared to state at this moment, he deems it desirable that the clause be included in this bill.  His  first reason would not be valid, no matter which side of the committee supported it. It does not matter very much whether a mistake has been made once in the past, assuming that it was a mistake. </para>

            <para>- The Minister&#39;s argument is faulty so far as he comes to a conclusion by criticizing section  13  and section  16  of the Stevedoring Industry Act  1949.  If I may use his own argument in reverse, his criticisms apply with equal force to clause  17,  clause  22.  and other clauses of this bill. The powers conferred on the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board by section  13  and section  16  of the  1949  act are proscribed by the provisions of the act as a whole. I am quite happy  te  concede to the Minister that the same argument applies to this clause and that the extent of the powers which he seeks to include in the bill in this clause are, or should be, proscribed by the other provisions of the bill. It is just one of those things on which w* may choose to disagree. The Opposition believes that the powers contained in thi? bill are too wide. </para>

            <para>- What I have said is fair comment. When we were considering clause 18 and the amendment to it, I pointed out that it was affected by the emergency power in clause 21, taken in conjunction with clause 17 (1.) (6), and clause 55 of the bill. The very safeguards that the Minister sought to insist upon by his amendment to clause 18 are eliminated by clause 55. There was no such removal of the safeguards in the 1949 act. The result is that to-day the Minister says that he is not prepared to explain the circumstances in which clause 25 will be brought into operation. Subclause (6.) of clause 21 reads - </para>

        <para class="block">I should like to know just what interpretation the Minister places on that subclause. There again, the authority has power to override its own decisions. If an order of the authority made under the emergency powers conflicted with a previous decision of the authority, the authority would be supreme in any cast. Any purported safeguard, which is supposed to be included in sub-clause (6.) of clause 21, is taken right out of the bill. It means nothing, unless the Minister can explain why sub-clause (6.) is included in clause 21. Previous clauses give priority to the decisions of the authority over those of the commission, and I cannot see why sub-clause (6.) is included unless it has some application to which the Minister has not yet referred. </para>

            <para>- It is obvious to me, but if I draw the obvious conclusion, the Minister accuses me of being partisan and of reading something sinister into the hill that is not there, though it is there all the time. To me, that provision gives no safeguard at all. The authority is supreme, especially in an emergency when it is not required to consult with anybody nor to refer any of its decisions to anybody else. That clause is nugatory; it has no effect whatever. In the face of the Minister&#39;s adamant refusal to explain the circumstances in which clause 21 would become operative, we are forced to the conclusion, for instance, that had the Minister had this power, he would have invoked it in January last. It is because of that very circumstance that we are jealous of the executive, whether in the form of the Minister or the GovernorGeneralinCouncil - in this case, the Minister - taking powers that are absolute and that could be used arbitrarily. I am not suggesting that the Minister would necessarily use them arbitrarily, but somebody else may in the future use them in that way. They could be used arbitrarily, and could have been so used last January, had they existed then. For that reason, clause 21 is repugnant and objectionable and we reject it. It is useless for the Minister to say that a similar power existed in the 1949 legislation. </para>

            <para>- Though sub-clause (6.) purports to provide some safeguard, by interpretation no safeguard exists. Where one clause qualifies another clause, for the sake of clarity and for the sake of the people who will interpret the bill when it becomes an act, these qualifications on the various sections should have been included when the bi|l was drafted. I do not blame the Parliamentary Draftsman. It is a matter that should be insisted upon by the Minister. For those reasons we cannot accept the amendment. The Minister, in my opinion, is not correct when he says a similar power existed in the 1949 legislation. </para>

          <para class="block">The tariff proposals I have just presented to the committee will operate as from 9 a.m. to-morrow morning. These proposals have a dual purpose. In the first instance, they propose to implement, insofar as variations to the Customs Tariff schedule are concerned, those tariff concessions undertaken by Australia during the negotiations at Geneva earlier this year under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I desire to make it clear to honorable members that the amendments effected by these proposals are not the only action required to implement fully the tariff concessions granted by Australia at Geneva. In addition, reductions of primage duty, the bringing into operation of existing intermediate tariff rates of duty, or the binding of existing duties and margins of preference, are involved in some cases. However, other action is being taken to a;ive effect to these changes, which will operate concurrently with the related variations made in the Customs Tariff proposals. Secondly, these proposals give effect to recommendations made by the Tariff Board in respect of certain products to which I shall refer at a later stage. These particular tariff variations are not, of course, associated in any way with those arising from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations at Geneva. </para>
          <para>At a later stage, I shall table the Tariff Board reports to which effect is now riven. At the same time, I shall table four other reports of the Tariff Board which the Government does not consider it desirable to implement. One of these four reports relates to coated paper, and one to agricultural tractors up to and including 10 belt-pulley-horse-power. These will be inquired into by the Tariff Board again. The remaining two reports cover toys and record changing devices. I also propose to table a report of the Tariff Board on artificial silk piece goods. This report recommends variations in the by-law admission of artificial silk piece goods, and the recommendation is being carried out. As is customary in matters of this kind, I have circulated to honorable members a memorandum which sets out in detail the extent of the tariff and primage varia tions accorded by Australia at Geneva. It also shows the extent of the tariff changes based on Tariff Board recommendations. I hope the memorandum will be helpful to honorable members in gaining a clear understanding of the proposed tariff and primage changes. </para>
          <para>At the Geneva negotiations Australia exchanged concessions with Germany, the United States of America and Austria. As was anticipated when Australia decided to take part in the 1956 conference, the scope for negotiation was not comparable with that of previous occasions. Australia&#39;s export trade should, however, benefit from the following tariff concessions : - Germany - Fresh apples, meat extracts, frozen rabbits, lead ore and eucalyptus tanning extracts; the United States - Eucalyptus tanning extracts, frozen rabbits, eucalyptus oil and catgut; Austria - Honey, meat extract and eucalyptus tanning extracts. </para>
          <para>It is. I might say, a principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that a concession granted by any contracting party also applies to all other members. Apart from direct concessions, Australian export trade will, therefore, benefit from the negotiations concluded between other contracting parties at Geneva. Tariff and primage concessions given by Australia, in broad terms, involve duty reductions on textile bleaching and dyeing machinery, battery eliminating devices and choke coils for wireless receivers, spectacle frames and beer. The Australian brewing industry is not likely to suffer very gravely as a result of those concessions. The  concescessions  also involve a. binding of the duties at the existing mostfavourednation level on embroideries in the piece, gold leaf, microscopes, and rubber, canvas and composition belting (other than conveyor belting) ; and the removal of primage duty on gold leaf, various mining and metallurgical machinery, weighing machines, various road-making machinery, textile-bleaching and dyeing machines, machines and machinery not elsewhere included, battery eliminating devices and chokes for wireless receivers, various gas appliances, rubber, canvas and composition belting (other than conveyor belting), various fancy boxes, magic lanterns and mounted lenses and camera accessories. </para>
          <para>From Australia&#39;s point of view, the outcome of these negotiations is reasonably balanced. The negotiations cannot, of themselves, be regarded as of major significance to our export trade, but they will, nevertheless, improve the market prospects for a number of our primary products. Honorable members will readily appreciate that the state of Australia&#39;s balance of payments is now such that the Government cannot overlook any means of expanding exports or of raising the returns from exports. The concessions accorded by Australia are not likely to have any adverse effect on local industries which are conducted on an economic and efficient basis. The proposed tariff variations associated with Tariff Board recommendations, to which I referred earlier, relate to electrically operated hand tools covered by tariff items 176 (u) (2) and 176 (u) (3), various dry colours, dyes and pigments covered by items 231 (a) and 231 (e) (2), synthetic oils and preparations containing synthetic resins covered by item 232 (e), and synthetic resins used in the paint industry formerly included in item 232 (e) but now covered by item 369 (c). As will be seen from part &#34; B &#34; of the memorandum already in the hands of honorable members, some increases in the duties on these goods are proposed, and on the remainder the duties either remain unchanged or have been reduced. These variations give full effect to Tariff Board recommendations. An opportunity to debate these proposals will be given to honorable members at a more convenient time. </para>

          <para>The truth is that Parliaments in this and other British countries have consistently gone about circumscribing and undermining the independent type of citizen by statutes which determine what he shall do and what he shall not do. Is it possible that Parliament is intolerant of the free man ? The role of the Liberal is to watch and work so that the law is confined to those things necessary for an orderly society, and that the rights of the individual do not perish in the process. </para>
          <para>The most potent modern menace to freedom in a democracy is the gathering power of bureaucracy. After all, the Parliament is elected and can be called to account at the next election. A government corrupted by power can be changed for one of more liberal views. But the bureaucracy goes on, not subject to popular elections, becoming more firmly entrenched in the knowledge it acquires and on which the less knowledgeable personnel of a  governmert  depends. The Socialist regards this as a desirable and inevitable part of the State, for which, he believes, the individual exists.

          <para>It is not, but it ought to be, common knowledge that there is in this country a considerable number of statutes, most of them passed during the last  twenty  years, which have vested in public officials, to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Law, the power of deciding questions of a judicial nature. Usually the power is given nominally to the Minister or other head of a government department, sometimes to the department itself, and it is commonly provided that his or its decision shall be final and conclusive. </para>
          <para>When it is provided that the matter is to be decided by the Minister, the provision really means that it is to be decided by some official, of more or less standing in the department, who has no responsibility except to his official superiors. The Minister himself in too many cases, it is to be feared, does not hear of the matter or the decision, unless he finds it necessary to make inquiries in consequence of some question in Parliament. The official who comes to the decision is anonymous, and, so far as interested parties and the public are concerned, is  unascertainable.  Ho is not bound by any particular course of procedure, unless a course of procedure is prescribed by the department, nor is he bound by any rules of evidence, and indeed he is not obliged to receive any evidence at all before coming to a conclusion. If he does admit evidence, he may wholly disregard it without diminishing the validity of his decision. There is not, except in comparatively few cases, any oral hearing, so that there is no opportunity to test by cross-examination such evidence as may be received, nor for the parties to controvert or comment on the case put forward by their opponents. It is, apparently, quite unusual for interested parties even to be permitted to have an interview with any one in the department. When there is any oral hearing, the public and the press are invariably excluded. Finally, it is not usual for the official to give any reasons for his decision. </para>
          <para>To employ the terms administrative &#34; law &#34; and administrative &#34; justice &#34; to such a system, or negation of system, is really grotesque. The exercise of arbitrary power is neither law nor justice, administrative or at all. The very conception of &#34; law &#34; is a conception of something involving the application of known rules and principles, and a regular course of procedure. </para>

        <para class="block">From so high an authority as Lord Hewart we have strong condemnation of a practice which is increasing, not only in this country, but also in other countries. I am aware that a provision similar to clause 22 was incorporated in the conciliation and arbitration legislation that was passed by this House recently. Unfortunately, I was engaged on official business elsewhere when that provision was agreed to. If I had been here then, I should have challenged it. because I think it is wrong in principle. I agree that, if an emergency arises, something must be done to meet it, but I think it is wrong to give to individuals the sweeping power specified in clause 22 - power to issue orally and then in writing a direction which will be beyond challenge to anybody, even though it might be inconsistent with a previous direction or award. Tho saving clause which wo approved a little while ago does not provide the opportunity for anybody to say, &#34; I cannot obey that direction, because it is not consistent with your previous decision &#34;. The authority would say, &#34; I do not care. You must carry out the order &#34;. It is like being in the Army, where the last order given by the commanding officer is the order which is obeyed, whether or not there is rhyme or reason in it, and whether or not it countermands a previous order. There is no appeal whatsoever against it. In essence, this provision removes from the individual his right of freedom. Throughout the debates of this bill and the amending arbitration legislation we have argued the merits of a right of appeal and whether there should be provision for appeal against decisions given. </para>

          <para>. - 1 enter the debate at this point, because, although a most imposing structure has been erected by my friend the honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leslie),</inline> it is - 1 shall not say unfortunately for him, because I am sure he will agree with me that it is fortunately for him - based on a foundation which is not stable. Perhaps it is the fault of the curious system, which we have adopted in our drafting, of excluding some of those provisions which operate as a matter of course under the Constitution. The provision to which the honorable gentleman refers does not exclude the normal constitutional right to take proceedings in the High Court for mandamus or prohibition where there has been action in excess of jurisdiction or something of that kind. Although clause  22  states that an order of the authority cannot be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called into question, and so on, that exclusion is subject to the provisions of the Constitution which enable the taking in the High Court of action of the kind I have mentioned. Occasionally clauses of this kind do include the words &#34; subject to the Constitution &#34;, but I gather that in modern drafting practice it is not considered accessary to include those words, because it follows as a matter of course that the constitutional right prevails. The sentiments expressed by the honorable member for Moore would commend themselves to us all, but here we are dealing first with a practical situation. Orders will be made by an authority, which will be the statutory authority of the Parliament. It will not be an irresponsible body. Similar provisions have appeared, not only in the earlier legislation affecting the stevedoring industry, in the acts of 1947 and 1949, and in this bill, but also in the current conciliation and arbitration legislation and the amending bill recently approved in this chamber. I can give the honorable gentleman the assurance that nothing which appears in the provision takes away from the rights which exist under the Constitution to take proceedings in the High Court. </para>

          <para>.- If this bill does not take away the right of appeal to the High Court, that is not the fault of the measure. The reason is that this Parliament cannot make an enactment which takes away the right of appeal to the High Court. I am well aware that this provision is a verbal repetition of section  52  of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1949, but I should like the Minister to explain a point, if he would be so kind. What he has indicated, I think, in his reply to the honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leslie)</inline> is, very simply, that if the Parliament sets up an authority which issues orders, obviously the Parliament cannot confer on the authority powers which it does not itself possess. But while the bill cannot prevent a man from appealing against the constitutionality of actions, if they are constitutional, we seem to be trying to prevent appeals on the question of their justice or rightness in themselves, and even whether they conform with the law. I should like the Minister, if he would be so kind, to explain this clause. </para>

        <para class="block">Parliament proposes, by means of this provision, to enact laws about which the Parliament knows nothing. We do not know what orders this authority will issue. We do know that we cannot confer upon it any powers higher than those which the Parliament itself possesses. Therefore, all its powers are subject to the Constitution. But it seems to me that in relation to clause 20 a question of justice is raised within the framework of the orders issued by this rule-making authority. The rather fearsome provision that an order of the authority shall not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called in question, or be subject to prohibition, mandamus or injunction, in any court on any count whatever, seems to me to be a gage thrown down to the courts. While I recognize that a gage has been thrown down before, I wonder whether the Minister would be prepared to express an opinion on the fate of such a provision if it were challenged in the High Court. </para>

          <para>.-I was aware of the fact that, as the Minister has explained, there are constitutional powers which are available to the individual. He has his normal constitutional rights, but I should hardly expect that issue to be raised in connexion with the point I make, which is that the element of simple justice might enter into the matter. It is not a question of whether the Parliament has power to make a law on any matter, and therefore whether the authority has power to issue a direction. The Parliament&#39;s powers are limited in that connexion. It is a question of pure, simple justice - the rights of the individual and the justice of the case. Clause 21, by its very nature, would be applied more to the employer than to the employee. I can hardly conceive of the authority going to the extent of issuing an oral or written instruction to every one of its several thousand employees. </para>

            <para>- I do not mind a court making an award, because it first receives evidence from both sides. I am even prepared to say that there should be no appeal from its decision, because it is up to the court to decide what is just, and one should accept that decision. But under this clause nothing like that will happen. The Minister can declare that there is an emergency, and the authority can then give a direction from which there will be no appeal. That direction might be inconsistent with an order of the authority, or an award of the commission, but until such time as it can be challenged - where I do not know - it must be obeyed. Clause 22 removes any doubt about this. If I, as an employer of labour on the waterfront, receive a direction from the authority and say, &#34; I know chat a state of emergency has been declared, but this is inconsistent with an order that you issued previously&#34;, the authority may reply, &#34; We do not give a damn about that. We do not consider nhat it is inconsistent. Regardless of what we said earlier, we consider that it is workable. Under clause 22 we are telling you to go ahead and do the job or you will be subjected to the penalties provided &#34;. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> right of challenge is given there. The words of the clause are clear and distinct - in any court on any account whatever. </para>

            <para>- I agree, but those powers are so sweeping that I cannot see the authority going beyond them. T am happy to see that they are so sweeping. They are set out in clause 17, paragraph (a) of which empowers the authority &#34; to regulate the performance of stevedoring operations &#34;. Why, bless my heart and soul, the authority could pluck the moon down from the sky and put it on the wharf, saying, &#34; We require this here in order to regulate stevedoring operations&#34;. The authority&#39;s power is unlimited. I have no objection to it exercising that power, but I do object to its decisions being removed from the field of challenge. Of course, they can be challenged on constitutional grounds, just as could the decisions of this Parliament. That is fundamental, and I am aware of it, but I am concerned that ordinary, common justice should be preserved. </para>

        <para>In the past we have, unfortunately, been too prone to hand over our powers to other bodies. The report of the Department of Civil Aviation has just been presented to the Parliament. That department has statutory power to make laws in accordance with the power of the Parliament itself. The department can go ahead and do what it likes. That, of course, is the easiest possible way out for the Parliament. It is much easier than sitting down and working out for ourselves what should be done. It is quite possible that the stevedoring authority, in time of emergency, may do what it considers desirable ; but it is what this Parliament considers desirable and just tl at should be done. I cannot see bow we can continue to agree to this sort of thing. We must not accept any provision which gives to an authority the power to take away from the individual his right to question its decision. That is what is being done here, and has been done in so many of our laws, lt is time that we put an end to it, and I hope that this will be the beginning of the end. </para>

My withers are unwrung because he has quoted it as having been section  3S  in our  1949  act. That is not in dispute. If it is a mistake, then the Labour party has made it also, but I would like the Minister to explain what would happen if the clause did not exist. That would then tell us why successive Ministers have included it, and against what they are safeguarding the country.

There would be no source of authority for orders relating to the waterfront, and it would be just the same as if there were no authority for an award of the court. If orders of the authority could be subjected to challenge, or appeal, or review, or could be called into question, it would be the beginning and the end of the story so far as those orders were concerned. There must be a source of authority somewhere. These powers have been found necessary by others who have been called upon to deal with this problem, in order to maintain practical administration, both in relation to this industry and to industry generally, under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

In relation to those matters that affected the powers of the court, which is to become the commission, the powers of the board were clearly defined. The board had no authority to intervene in the matters that were rightly controlled by the court. The honorable member has rightly raised  a question at this point. He has raised the very question that we have been hammering for hours in order to try to get the Minister to say what was intended in clause 21. Nobody in this committee yet knows the powers that are to be bestowed on this authority under clause 21. That is the very thing about which the honorable member has complained in connexion with clause 22. </para>

            <para>- But are they unlimited under clause 22 in relation to clause 21? I presume that clause 22 can only mean that decisions given by the authority have this allpowerful application, provided they are not inconsistent with an award or decision that has been made by the commission. I think that the Minister would agree with that statement. Sub-clause (6.) of clause 21 reads as follows: - </para>

        <para class="block">Clause 22 follows immediately upon that provision. I do not think that there can he any doubt upon one point made by the Minister, that this authority, as was the -case with the conciliation commissioners under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of 1947, has to have powers in relation to the settlement of problems that confront it against which there should be no appeal. I do not think that anybody can disagree with me when I say that this is a power which, in some respects, despite all that may be stated in another field, is essential if proper control of industry is desired. The honorable member for Moore, who is interjecting, should have come to that argument a long time ago, because that has been one of the problems in this bill. The Opposition would still like the Minister to say, insofar as it is physically possible for a Minister to say, what this provision means, having regard to all the other provisions of the bill. Does it mean, in effect, that in relation to those matters which are properly covered by the commission, this clause would not have effect, even if the authority were to give a decision that was contrary to or inconsistent with an award decision already made by the commission in relation to matters on the waterfront? </para>

          <para>.- There has been a great deal of confusion and bother about what is meant by a very simple clause, which relates to an order or direction of the authority. An order or direction of the authority must be an order or direction of the authority which is valid. If it is valid, it cannot be challenged in any court; if it is not a valid direction, of course it is open to challenge on the ground of invalidity. The position is very simple indeed, and I cannot understand at all why there is so much confusion and bother about it. As I understood from an interjection by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> when the honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Leslie)</inline> was speaking, the Minister takes the same view - that this relates only to a valid order or direction of the authority. </para>

          <para>. - I believe that inspectors should have greater powers than are conferred in this clause. &#91; express that view because it has been the practice in the past, and is still the practice, to blame on the watersiders all the difficulties and problems on the waterfront, and this clause gives me an opportunity to point out that a good deal of time lost on the waterfront is lost because of faulty stevedoring operations. If the inspectors were given power to control operations less time would be lost, and the turn-round of ships would be quicker, and the work of loading and unloading vessels would be done much more expeditiously than is the case to-day. I have here some examples given to me of recent occurrences on the waterfront during which a great deal of time was lost, and a great amount of trouble caused, because of faulty stevedoring operations and an obvious lack of knowledge in the persons in charge of such operations. Men were employed for a longer time than was necessary, or were employed on work that was completely unnecessary, so that there were delays in the movement of shipping. One such case concerned SS. <inline font-style="italic">Whakatane,</inline> at Sydney, on Monday, the 21st May, 1956. Four hundred and fifty cases of canned meats were stacked in the shed on the wharf. Instructions were given to the men to load this cargo into No. 5 hold. On the completion of loading, instructions were given for the cargo to be discharged. The work took approximately three hours. Inquiries established that the cargo was not for shipment overseas, but was consigned to a military depot at Marrickville, a suburb of Sydney. The cargo was later delivered by truck. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another case concerned the same ship. On the 24th May, 1956, thirteen kegs of a powder preparation were loaded into No. 3 hatch, hut were later discharged and re-loaded into No. 2 hatch. Later in the day, wool was discharged from No. 3 hatch and stacked in the shed at the berth. This took approximately three hours. It is understood that it had been loaded in Melbourne and, due to some error, it was found necessary to discharge and stack it in the shed for future disposal. This vessel was approximately a week at the berth, employing, on an average, three gangs throughout that period. The necessary work could have been easily done in three days. The vessel was loaded for America and east coast ports. </para>
        <para>Another case last month concerned the SS. <inline font-style="italic">Colundra.</inline> On the 10th May, 1956, men working No. 2 hatch were ordered to load a 15-ton lift, and stow it &#39;tween decks. After the lift was slung and taken aboard, it was found it was too high for the deck. The company then ordered the men to put it back on the wharf, where it was left. The ship sailed that night leaving the lift behind. </para>
        <para>Another case concerned the SS. <inline font-style="italic">Eastern Star,</inline> which was berthed at 24 Pyrmont on the 23rd May, 1956. Two gangs and 22 extras were engaged. The gang in No. 3 hatch, which subsequently went to No. 2 hatch forward, spent from 5.30 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. awaiting the arrival of wool. The actual statement of the situation may be put as follows: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Time  lost  - 2 hours 30 minutes. </para>
          <para>Man-hours lost (1 gang - 11 extras) -65 man-hours. </para>

        <para class="block">I could give many illustrations of men having been called upon to perform unnecessary work. Men have been picked up, but the cargo they were to handle has not been available, or a ship has not arrived, or something of that kind hae happened, so that money was paid out for no work, or for work that was unnecessary. I think that inspectors should have some authority in matters of that kind. So I repeat to honorable members on the Government side of the chamber that the whole of the responsibility for difficulties and delays on the waterfront does not rest on the watersiders. Much of it rests on the persons in charge of stevedoring operations. The stevedoring employers have engaged labour without having made appropriate preparations, or have given wrong instructions so that cargoes have been loaded into the wrong holds, and have had to be transferred to other holds. </para>
        <para>I oan assure the committee that the three examples I have given are only a few of those that indicate the necessity for inspectors to have some control over these matters, and particularly the necessity to give the stevedoring authority power to control the operations of stevedoring companies. If my recollection of the Basten report is correct, one of  the  things it pointed out was that wool sometimes failed to arrive on time to be loaded on ships. Many examples were cited in the report of wool failing to arrive, and of ships being delayed as a result. Generally, the excuse given for the holding up of ships in such cases was that the waterside workers were not loading as much in the same time as they used to load fifteen or twenty years ago. </para>
        <para>It would be just as well for us to realize that there are two factors involved in the handling of cargo. One is the men who do the work; the other is the people who have the power of direction. If the employer falls down on the job, his failure to organize and manage things properly drives up costs, and it is not fair for people to say in this chamber that the whole of the responsibility for the chaos and confusion that at times exists on our wharfs lies with the waterside workers, who are said to be not playing the game. </para>

I do not want to spend much time on it. &#34;We had a measure before us about two years ago, which was supposed to solve our problems in respect of waterfront quotas. I can recall that we had what might be termed a first-class disagreement with the Government on that point. That legislation gave to the employers authority to nominate men to fill quotas not met by the Waterside Workers Federation in a particular port. I know that there have been difficulties in relation to this matter, and I think that this is a most appropriate occasion, and this is the best place, for me to discuss how the new authority will act in relation to it. We remember that a great deal of bitterness was engendered as a consequence of this Government&#39;s legislative action two years ago over quotas. All sorts of threats were uttered by the waterside workers about what they would do to the shipowners, while the shipowners made threats about what they would do if the waterside workers did not meet their responsibilities. The upshot of it all was that, when both parties finally realized their great problem, conferences were held in an attempt to resolve the difficulty. The Australian Council of Trades Unions played a rather important part in those conferences. </para>

            <para>- 1 know, but clause 25 provides for port quotas. I have finished with clause 26. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of clause 25 provides that the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority shall from time to time determine, by instrument in writing, the quota of waterside workers at each port. I suggest that the sort of arrangements worked out between the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Australian Council of Trades Unions, on the one hand, and the shipowners, on the other hand, fifteen months ago, which resulted in a good deal of satisfaction, may well be favoured by the proposed authority. If, as the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> has suggested, the Government will appoint reasonable men to the authority. I am hopeful that, despite what some honorable members have said about the present leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, we shall achieve more conciliation, particularly on this matter, because it involves a fundamental principle on which the waterside workers depend, and the problem is a very important one. I think I heard some one say in this chamber only last week that 1,100 waterside workers at the port of Melbourne were paid attendance money in one day. That is the sort of situation that no nation can afford to allow to continue. I am hopeful that the proposed authority will forget some of the things that have been said in this chamber abou t the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation and will understand that we must have conciliation between the employers and the workers on the waterfront, and that, as a first step towards that conciliation, it will adopt some of the principles that were adopted fifteen months ago. That would be a first important step towards peace on the waterfront. </para>

        <para class="block">This provision authorizes an increase of a quota that has been fixed by the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority.&#39; Apparently, the intention is that, for a period, which may be less than six months, but which certainly shall not exceed six months, that quota may be exceeded, and it is provided, also, that the persons registered in excess of the quota are to become members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. For the time being, the ranks of the union are to be considered to include more than the number of waterside workers which past practice and experience have shown to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the port. The committee should realize that, when we are dealing with a casual industry that is so essential as is the stevedoring industry, and when we are endeavouring to fix a quota of workers for a port, whether there be a rush period or a slack period to be met, we must give the workers concerned greater security than this clause will give them if we want to keep them on the waterfront as skilled and competent waterside workers. </para>
        <para>Remarkable statements are made now and again about the earnings of men on the waterfront. If the actual records could be secured, it would be shown that the turnover of labour on the waterfront is greater than the turnover in any other industry in Australia. The number of persons who work on the waterfront because they believe they will get good wages and constant work - so far as work of a casual nature can be constant - is remarkable. Many people, who have become members of the Waterside Workers Federation, find in a very short time that the employment is not as constant and the earnings not by any means as great as they believed. As a consequence they leave the organization and others are enrolled. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what the court has decided, but I know from my own experience that people leave this industry. This proposal seeks to expand for intervals the number of persons who can work on the waterfront. But after the flush period is over, those persons are t&#62;o be discarded. They are to go out of the industry, and will have to find employment elsewhere. If the intention of the Government is to bring about more constant employment than there is to-day, it will not do so by putting into operation a provision that will encourage the temporary enrolment of men in order to cope with a sudden increase in the requirements of the waterfront so that when those demands have been met, the additional labour can he put off. That system will bring into operation the worst of seasonal conditions. The men who follow the waterfront for their livelihood will not feel happy about that proposal; nor will the persons who give their services and find that, as soon as the demand slackens they are sacked and have to look for work elsewhere. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have had a good deal of experience of seasonal work and I know of the difficulties that constantly arise when a lot of men are suddenly pushed in, and then suddenly put off. The stevedoring authority has been in operation for some years and has some knowledge of the arrival and departure of ships. It has its graphs of employment and knows the times when there is a requirement for extra men, and a falling-off in the requirement for men. With all that information available, it should be possible to fix a quota that can be regarded as fairly stable and as reliable as any port can expect with work of this description. </para>
        <para>For those reasons, I feel that this nev and novel proposal must be rejected. Ii will not bring about a better feeling on the waterfront and will not be conducive to more efficient and better organized stevedoring operations than those existing at present. If an employer knows that he is able to get a special quota because a number of ships arrive, he will not try to organize his labour force correctly. But if he knows that the quota, having been fixed, will stay at that figure for a certain period and that he has to make it meet all the requirements of the port, he will be more inclined to organize the work in such a manner as to make sure that the labour in the port is utilized in the most efficient manner. </para>
        <para>Any provision that enables people to escape the requirements of efficient management and proper organization of work by endeavouring to force men on to the waterfront for brief periods is against the best interests of the industry itself. In these days of full employment, it is undesirable that people should be enticed away from an industry that may want them and is giving them constant employment in order to meet the peculiar difficulties that may be found upon the waterfront at various times. That causes a bigger turnover in productive industry because men leave jobs, and their positions have to be filled. </para>

            <para>- As no other honorable member has risen, I shall take my second period now. Instead of bringing about regularity of employment in industry generally, this proposal will introduce a new disturbing factor in the whole process of employment. On many occasions in the past, we have heard in this  oil amber a good deal about the unfortunate turnover of labour and how it is affecting industry. The labour turnover means that persons who are trained to do a certain class of work and have become valuable in that industry because of their particular skill and &#34; know-how &#34;, leave the industry and go somewhere else, and the process has to he repeated. That has been pointed out as one of the causes of increased costs of production and of some of the frustration that industry is experiencing because labour is constantly changing. This proposal will aggravate those difficulties in industry. It will not only aggravate them but will add to what can be shown very clearly to be a good deal of mismanagement in the stevedoring industry. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I want to give some idea of the tremendous number of hours that are lost. The first instance relates to the ship <inline font-style="italic">Circus,</inline> in Sydney, ft was loading at No.  21  wharf, Pyrmont, on behalf of the Darling Island Company. These facts were given to me. At  4.4.5  p.m. the foreman ordered the truckers to bring in five bales of chemically treated and highly inflammable wool, which should have been deck cargo. The truckers, who told the foreman that they had finished the wool for that particular port, obeyed the foreman&#39;s instructions and put the wool into No.  2  hold. The company then loaded wool on top of it on Saturday morning and until  11.30  a.m. on Monday, when the company discovered that the bales were missing. The company, having no record of the bales, assumed that they were in No.  5  hatch and discharged  200  bales from No.  5  hatch before it discovered that they had been placed in No.  2  hatch. The loss of time discharging and loading in No.  5  hatch was six hours. At  11.30  a.m. on Monday the company commenced discharging No.  2  hatch in order to find the five bales, and found them at  3.40  p.m. after  251  bales had been discharged. The loss of time in No.  2  hatch was approximately eight hours. The total loss of hours was fourteen. The total man hours lost for  23  men - fifteen in the gang, six truckers and  2  loading up - was  322  man hours ; that is,  23  multiplied by  14. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I do not propose to give any other illustrations, but many examples of this sort of thing can be cited. I want to stress, and stress as strongly as I possibly can, that if labour is to be made available in any quantity that may be doomed necessary by those employing the labour because a number of ships have entered port and they feel they will not have sufficient men, then mistakes of that description, which are being made by the stevedoring companies, will increase instead of diminish. I am sorry that provisions for control of the industry have not been included in this bill, because <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> must ensure not only that sufficient men are available, but also that those men are used to the best possible advantage, so that the best possible return  is  gained from their labour during their hours of employment, and that the organization of the industry is such that every moment of a man&#39;s time that is paid for gives a productive result. My experience of people being brought into the industry in circumstances such as are envisaged in the bill leads me to the firm conviction that these provisions can result only in an aggravation of the troubles that already exist. These provisions will not be conducive to peace on the waterfront. They  will  be strongly resisted by the Waterside Workers Federation, and instead of bringing about the better conditions that the Minister hopes for, they are more likely to aggravate the present problems, and to cause a good deal of hostility and antagonism. </para>

          <para>. - 1  agree with the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey),</inline> that this clause will increase our industrial difficulties. I was interested to note the illustration given by the honorable member of loss of time resulting from bad administrative practices. It is obvious that if those who conduct stevedoring  activities run their businesses in such a way, a much larger number of men will be used on the waterfront than is actually required. I shall give honorable members another illustration of inefficient organization of stevedoring activities. On the 5th June last, at Port Adelaide, the vessel <inline font-style="italic">Port Phillip</inline> commenced discharging at 9 a.m. Gang No. &#177;4 started at No. 5 hatch discharging a deck cargo consisting of bags of asbestos. This operation was completed by 4 p.m. The gang then proceeded to discharge bags of asbestos from the  &#39;tween-decks,  working until 5 p.m. The gang resumed work at S a.m. on Wednesday, the 6th June, and worked until 5 p.m. on the asbestos cargo. It resumed work at 8 a.m. on Thursday, the 7th June, and worked until 11 a.m., when the discharging of asbestos was completed at this hatch. The gangs at other hatches were also discharging asbestos. It was a cargo consigned to Melbourne and Devonport, but it had to he discharged to enable the cargo for Adelaide to be removed. At 11 a.m. on Thursday, the 7th June, nearly two and a half days after the joh commenced, gang No. 44 commenced discharging general cargo for Port Adelaide. This was completed by 5 p.m. on Friday, the Sth June. The asbestos cargo then had to be reloaded on the vessel, and this work was not completed until 12 noon on Tuesday, the 12th June. The operation of discharging and reloading the asbestos required 34 hours&#39; working time, whilst the unloading of the Port Adelaide cargo occupied only thirteen hours. The Government complains about the slow turn-round of ships, while that sort of mismanagement is allowed to occur. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If the Government intends to provide that the authority may register extra men if it is of the opinion that more men will be required than are provided by the port quota, the waterside workers already registered at that port must feel resentment. I have been told by waterside workers themselves, not by officials of the union, that some of the men who are admitted to the federation do not last a day in it. After a short experience of working conditions on the wharfs, they say, &#34;If this is waterside work I will have no more of it &#34;, and they walk off the job. The Government is mistaken if it thinks that it can build a bigger labour force on the waterfront simply by increasing the port quota. I do not want to labour the question, but I did wish to put on record the facts that I have just cited to the committee. </para>

            <para>- This information was sent to me from Port Adelaide. 1 do not normally give the names of people who provide this kind of information, because some of them might be penalized. It may be that my informants would not object if I made their names known, but at present I do not propose to do so. I have given the committee the number of the gang, the relevant dates, and the name of the vessel, and the Minister can easily check those facts and refute them if he finds them incorrect. This is the sort of inefficiency that we see every week in our ports. </para>

The honorable member for Bendigo has just given the committee particulars of another such case, when it was necessary to remove a few bales of wool that had been wrongly stowed, and the stevedoring company did not know in which hatch the wool had been loaded. </para>

        <para>I am concerned with the feelings of the men regarding the oft-repeated claim, that more men are needed on the waterfront because of the slow turn-round of the ships. The waterside workers are not to blame for that state of affairs. Very often the delays are caused by the shipping companies or the stevedoring interests, or by the officers in charge of  the various vessels. I agree entirely with the attitude taken by the Opposition in regard to this clause. </para>

          <para>.- In <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> 1949  legislation, section  27  gave very wide powers regarding the employment of persons as waterside workers at a port at which a sufficient number of registered workers was not available. The provision that the committee is now debating is part of an attempt by the Government to provide, in certain circumstances, that an additional labour force shall he available. There are other clauses in the bill which are designed for the same purpose. These provisions are very precisely limited. They are not in the general form of the provisions in the  1949  legislation. The section that was inserted in the  .1949  act for this purpose has been a failure. Enforcement of its provisions has not been possible. The Tait committee&#39;s report states definitely that a supplementary labour force could not be obtained under the  1949  legislation. The report of the Tait committee makes it clear that, as a result of the threats of the federation to bring about strikes and stoppages of work, it was not possible to enforce the provisions of the  1949  act. That committee said that the federation has enjoyed what is in effect a monopoly of the right to supply labour in the industry. What the Opposition is really fighting against in regard to these clauses that deal with the supplementary labour force is the fact that its own provision was unworkable and that it suited the Waterside Workers Federation. In fighting the battle for the federation, the Opposition is fighting for that organization to have a monopoly of the right to supply labour so that it may have supreme control of the waterfront. That is what the Government is endeavouring to prevent. </para>

        <para>In  1949,  it was fully realized by at least one person who described himself as being a Labour man that the effect of the  1.949  legislation would be to place the waterfront under the complete control of the Communists. Let me quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume  203,  page  1977,  what the then honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> had to say about the  1949  legislation. </para>

        <para class="block">The purpose of the three proposed amendments is to make quite clear that we are covering in the legislation the agreement which currently exists between the Waterside Workers Federation, the shipowners, and the stevedoring companies, that no request will be made for the application of the redundancy provision within twelve months after the determination of a quota. Proposed sub-clause (1a.), for the insertion of which I shall move later, makes the position quite clear. This group of amendments is being moved to meet the request put to us from the meeting of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.&#39; The view which we put to the representatives of those organizations at that time was that the matter was sufficiently covered by the existing paragraph (b). In view of the proposed new provision, to make it clear that action should not be taken within twelve months after the fixation of a quota, a further amendment is necessary. Moreover, even where there is a request twelve months after a quota has been determined, the authority will not act if it believes that wastage will bring the number registered down to the quota within a period of six months. I think that honorable gentlemen opposite will find that this meets the request which was put to us, and I hope that they will be able to give their support to the amendment which I have moved. </para>

        <para class="block">The purpose of my proposed amendments to clauses 35 and 36 is to perfect the intention of clause 35 (2.) and clause 36 (2.). The practice of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board has been to provide that suspension shall have effect only on days on which a port is normally working. Previously, when the board suspended, work at the port sometimes stopped, and the consequence was that the suspensions really amounted to no punishment at all. This is one of the sanctions which have been provided in the legislation. The amendment will confirm existing practice. There was soma doubt  -whether  the previous section authorized  the  practice that has been in vogue up to  the  present. The same explanation is  true of  clause  35.  Sub-clause  (1.)  reads  in part - the court may order the Authority to can cel the registration of the employer, or to suspend his registration lor such period, or at such times, as the Court directs, and thereupon the Authority shall cancel or suspend the registration of the employer accordingly. </para>

          <para>.-- I  wish to oppose the amendment because I oppose the clause in either its early  form  or its amended form. This clause is a distinct change from the corresponding section of the  1949  act. It is  also  at variance with the recommendations of the Tait committee. Honorable members will recall that the  1949  legislation provided that waterside workers and stevedoring companies should be disciplined in a similar manner for inefficiencies or breaches of their duties under the act. Section  23  reads -  (1.) Where, after such inquiry as it thinks fit, the Board is satisfied that an employer - (a) is unfit to continue to he registered as an employer; the Board may cancel his registration, or may suspend his registration for such period as it thinks fit. </para>

        </list>
        <para>Honorable members will notice that the method of dealing with the faults, breaches of duties and inefficiencies of the employer and the waterside worker is the same in each case. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the Tait report. At paragraph  83  the committee points out - unanimously, as the Minister would say -  that it is  necessary to have discipline in the hands of the authority for employers as well as employees. I shall read the sentences upon which I rely. It states - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee finds that it is necessary that the Statutory Authority should have power both to discipline registered workers and to discipline registered employers. In the case of employers, this should extend to such matters as failures on the part of supervisors and foremen, properly and adequately- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">And I emphasize the next phrase -  in the opinion of the Statutory Authority, to control and supervise the men allotted to them. In addition to deregistration of em  plovers  which is a power which obviously should be retained, a power to suspend or to fine would be proper to be included as part of the system and would make for efficiency. </para>
        <para class="block">The Government proposes, under this bill, that the method of dealing with waterside workers who fall down on the job, or breach their duties, shall be the same as it was under the  1949  act; that is, they are to be deregistered by the authority just as, under that act, they were deregistered by the board. If they are dissatisfied with that decision, they can appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court, but it is up to them to decide whether they will appeal. In the meantime, of course, they will be without their jobs and will have been dealt with summarily and, if you like, clandestinely, by the authority. Honorable members should note the different treatment which will.be accorded the stevedoring companies. It displays quite markedly the tender treatment which the Government seeks to give to the one side, and the unmitigated rigours of the treatment which it preserves for the other side. </para>

Under clause 34 the stevedoring company is only to be fined by the court. That may be fair enough and I do not cavil at it. </para>

            <para>- I agree, but, after all, it is surely the comparison between the talent and the widow&#39;s mite. A fine of &#163;100 and not more than &#163;1,000 might well be a bagatelle to a stevedoring company, but utterly ruinous to a waterside worker. </para>

        <para>The Minister has not mentioned at any time during the second reading or committee stages, the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation imposes consistent and rigorous discipline upon its members - a practice that the stevedoring companies have notoriously failed to adopt with employees and officers who have failed to carry out their duties. To return to clause 35: If the authority is of the opinion that a company should be deregistered it cannot act on its own motion, as it can in the case of a stevedoring worker. It must bring the matter to the court. The clause states that - </para>

          <para>If the Court, on the application of the Authority, if&#62; satisfied that an employer registered at a port- is inefficient, it may deregister that employer. That is not carrying out the Tait committee&#39;s report which, of course, stated that it was necessary that employers who, in the opinion of the statutory authority had, through their supervisors and foremen, failed, should be deregistered. Here the Government is not permitting the opinion of the statutory authority to take effect, but is leaving it to the court to decide whether the statutory authority&#39;s opinion is satisfactory. That is a most marked, unjust and  unjustifiable  departure from the practice followed after the 1949 act. and from the recommendation of the Tait committee. </para>

        <para>Let me point out that the Government has, for over three years, allowed the Stevedoring Industry Board to remain powerless to deal with employers. The powers to deal with employees have, of course, never been challenged. They have been effective, but in the case of <inline font-style="italic">The Queen</inline> versus the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Stevedoring. Industry Board, ex parte Melbourne</inline><inline font-style="italic">Stevedoring</inline><inline font-style="italic">Company Proprietary Limited</inline> - probably the most notoriously inefficient of the vast number of inefficient stevedoring companies in Australia - it was held by the High Court that the word &#34; unfit &#34; did not apply to the company where only its stevedoring foremen had been inefficient. The Minister will remember that, as a result of that decision, which was given on the 30th April, 195&#38; - more than three years ago - the board was deprived of its power to discipline the stevedoring companies. It was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> notorious case. The stevedoring company did not know that some of its employees had gone off to an hotel and had been arrested before they could get back to the ship. The company did not know of the condition of the men or even of their absence. </para>
        <para>The board, because this was only the culmination of a series of inefficiencies and irresponsibilities on the part of the Melbourne Stevedoring Company Proprietary Limited, deregistered that company. The company went to the High Court, as it was entitled to do. The High Court said in effect, &#34; The sectionas at present phrased does not enable the board to do this thing &#34;. Despite that decision, despite the comment made and* the impotence revealed in. the board&#39;? fourth report for the year ended the 30th June, 1953, the Government did not amend the section for over three years. It has perpetuated this one-sided form of discipline on the wharfs. For the last three years, the board has been able to discipline employees and has been unable to discipline employers. Hereafter, the authority will still be able to discipline the waterside workers, and still be unable to discipline the waterside companies. All that it will be able to do will be to go to the Commonwealth Industrial Court and ask the court to discipline the companies. The clause changes the intention of the 1949 act. It leaves the authority as  impotent as it previously was and it does not effectuate the recommendation of the Tait committee. </para>

        <para class="block">As I indicated during the debate on clause 35, my amendment to this clause follows the same general pattern as the amendment to clause 35. I take the opportunity to reply to what the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline> had to say regarding the excess of tender.ness which, according to him, members of the Government have displayed in this measure towards the shipowners and the stevedoring companies. Of course, that is a statement easy enough to make, but very much more difficult to prove; and &#91; think the best answer that I can give to that charge is that had the Government wished to show any special tenderness to shipowners and stevedoring companies we should not have, at this time, a measure of this sort before the Parliament. My reason for saying that is that here we are setting about constituting, in a permanent sense, a. waterfront authority, a government authority, when it is well and widely known that at all times the shipowners have been opposed to the existence or the continuance of any authority of this sort. </para>

But that has not worked to the disadvantage of the employees in this industry, because the Tait committee recommended a system of fines to be applied to waterside workers. We found, on examining: the matter, that it was not practicable to institute a system of fines, imposable on employees, which would work satisfactorily; but that has not inhibited  u*  from instituting provisions for substantial fines ranging from &#163;100 to &#163;l,00f&#62; which may be imposed on employers. </para>

            <para>- The  union  can collect it in fees. After all, a trade union can levy, for Labour party  purposes,  on people who have never had  any intention of voting for Labour candidates, but who happen to be members of that particular union, which subscribes to the funds of the Labour party. There are other circumstances which, I suggest, indicate that what has been done here is the proper way to go about meeting the practical problems that we have bad to face. First, the very fact of instituting proceedings against a stevedoring company is itself damaging to the reputation and the commercial goodwill of that company. It is an important decision for the authority to make and, even if proceedings were unsuccessful, they could hardly fail to be damaging to the company or the employer concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The next point is that the act of suspension of a stevedoring company, if it were to run over any period of days or weeks, would not have a direct effect only on the company concerned, and be damaging to it. We are not so much worried about that, but we are concerned about employees of that employer who might be quite guiltless in the commission of the offence. However, it would be hard to imagine a situation in which most of the employees were not entirely guiltless of the alleged offence. Yet, if an employer were suspended for a period of days, in all probability the employees in turn would be suspended by him, and so lose their employment. So we say that, whilst an argument can be based on the way in which these clauses appear in the bill, if the practical test be applied of what is a satisfactory way to go about dealing with the problems which have been posed for the authority, I think that most sensible people will say that this is about the best, working result that could be produced in the situation. I have no hesitation in recommending the amendment to the committee. </para>

          <para>.- Now that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> has moved his amendment and has entered into a general discussion of the clause, I think that the general debate on the clause might well take place on the amendment. The question of the adoption of the amendment can then be put to the committee, and the clause then be dealt with as a whole. The Opposition strongly objects to the differential treatment meted out under this bill, particularly through clause 36, to watersideworkers as compared with employers. Clause 33 dealt with the obligations of registered employers, clause 34 with thepunishment of offences by employers, and. clause 35 with the cancellation or suspension of the registration of employersClause 36 deals with the cancellation or suspension of the registration of waterside workers. A comparison of the wording of this clause with that of clause 34r and clause 35 makes it very clear indeed that much more regard is had for the ordinary practices in these matters in. dealing with employers than in dealingwith. waterside workers. The employer must be taken to court, and that guarantees him a hearing of the whole of the facts in relation to the offence he if alleged to have committed. If the court recommends to the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority that his registration should be cancelled, the authority can act on that recommendation. But, first, a charge must be made. Secondly, a hearing must take place and5 a court must be convinced that an offence has been committed. Thirdly, if the employer is convicted, a penalty is then, imposed upon him.  His  rights as an employer and as an individual are safeguarded by the court proceedings. However, in relation to waterside workers, the whole of this machinery is eliminated. It is not necessary that a charge should be laid against him, or that a court hearing should take place before a decision on the suspension or cancellation of his registration is made. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 36 merely states - </para>

        <para class="block">The inquiry is limited to what the authority thinks fit. It has been found in the past that when, for some reason, a dispute has occurred on the waterfront, almost as soon as the men have ceased work they have been suspended. It is apparent that their side of the case hasnot been heard. In fact, in sub-clause (3.). the power to suspend before inquiry is conferred upon the authority. Nosuch provision is made with respect to employers. An employer may not he- suspended until a court has inquired, has convicted him, and has recommended that the authority suspend him. But subclause (3.) provides - </para>

          <para>The Authority may, before holding an inquiry under this section in respect of a waterside worker, suspend the registration of the waterside worker and may at any time revoke that suspension. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The suspension can take place before an inquiry has been held, and the right of the waterside worker concerned to earn his livelihood at his accustomed employment will be taken from him. It is true that a fine may be imposed upon an employer, but the waterside worker may suffer the worse punishment of being deprived of his right to continue his occupation. Until such time as the suspension is lifted, he will have no right to work upon the waterfront and will not be entitled to a call-up, to a pick-up, or to attendance money. In effect, he will be punished by the loss of his wages throughout the entire period of suspension, and this could be a very serious matter for him. </para>

            <para>- That is so. The point I want to drive home is that, here, again, we have a division of power between a court and the proposed authority, which will make the position more confusing than ever. Because the employer must be taken before a court, he will have a protection not afforded to the employee. The employee can be suspended without an in nui ry, and immediately he will lose his livelihood, whereas the employer, on. the other hand, must first be charged and taken before a court for a hearing. The court must convict him before a penalty can be imposed. But the penalty would not mean the loss of his business as a. stevedore, because he may be fined and mav continue his business, whereas the waterside worker will suffer immediate cancellation of his right to employment upon the waterfront. While his suspension continues, he will not be able to nam a livelihood. The point raised .by my friend the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline> is quite correct. The loss of the right to pursue his livelihood is a much more severe punishment than a fine of &#163;100 imposed on an individual employer or of &#163;1,000 imposed upon a stevedoring company. Such a fine  would be neither here nor there to the employer. I repeat that we have thi.division of authority which provides one form of trial for the waterside worker and an entirely different form for theemployer. It confuses every one and will prevent the authority itself from  exercis-  ing the control it ought to have. If provision is to be made for the suspension of persons engaged in stevedoring work, suspensions should be imposed in like manner, and with like force, upon both employer and employee by the proposed authority. For the reasons that I have stated, the Opposition proposes to vote against the clause. It is a bad one, and it. should not have been included in  the  bill. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey)</inline> made a very impassioned plea on behalf of the waterside workers. He said that this is an iniquitous clause which will deny the worker the right to work by depriving him of the right to a trial before a court. . I cannot see why the honorable gentleman objects to the clause, because it accords with union practice. When unionists declare a man a scab, they debar him from his work for life. I have mentioned this matter  several times in this chamber. Unionists at the present time are declaring shearers who are willing to shear at the award rates scabs, and denying them the right to work at their calling for the rest of their lives merely because they are willing to observe the terms of a legally made award. Time and again, Opposition members have been told in this Parliament that their union practices do not stand examination in the light of day. Opposition members make a plea now on behalf of a man who may be suspended by the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, although his case will be tried by the authority. But they would force workers to join unions, and would then deny them, for the rest of their lives, the right to work at their  calling. 1 cannot see any ground for the Opposition&#39;s objection to the amendment. </para>

From time to time, we hear Government supporters make references to the equality of all before the law, and to the maintenance of the rule of law. But this measure makes a very great distinction between, on the one hand, what I shall call the leisurely justice accorded to the employer, and on the other, the rough justice meted out to the worker, who may be deregistered summarily by the proposed Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, and who will then be out of a job until his appeal is heard by the court, if he wishes to appeal. </para>

As the honorable member for Bendigo has said, the employee will, in effect, be fined by deregistration, whereas a stevedoring company will be able to continue its operations pending the more leisurely process before the judicial court. I should have thought that the fair thing would be to provide for summary suspension for both the employer and the employee and to provide that deregistration in either case would be effected by the court. I should have thought that the fair thing would have been to require summary suspension for both the employer and the employee and chat before either could be deregistered that an application should be made to the court. </para>

        <para class="block">He is penalized until such time as he proves his innocence, and that is undesirable. I take it that the Minister says he has departed in this clause from the Tait report because of the difficulty of imposing a fine. That is another undesirable feature so far as natural justice is concerned. If a dispute arises <inline font-style="italic">over</inline> a small matter, an <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> decision is made, an inspector reports it, the matter is referred to a board of reference and the board of reference reaches a decision. Any appeal would be against that decision, so the board of reference takes off its coat as a board of reference, puts on another coat and becomes the authority. The appeal is from Caesar to Caesar. . That is another undesirable aspect of this measure. </para>
        <para>I still cannot understand why there should be a distinction in these two provisions merely because the Minister and his advisers cav tot work out a system of fines, and a diferent system is applied to the employer, which in the main is a company. This bill perpetuates the difficulty, to which attention was directed by the Tait committee, that the employer is not responsible for those acts committed by his foremen or such people to the same severe degree and on the same conditions as apply to the employee. It continues the unjust system that has existed for the last three years, since the Melbourne stevedoring case was decided and to which specific attention was directed in the Tait report. </para>
        <para>I do not see why provision could not he made for summary suspension for a short period by the authority of both the employer and the employee, pending an appeal to the court. That would avoid the objectionable features so far as natural justice is concerned and would have the effect of bringing both the employer and employee into line. It would avoid the penalty that is imposed upon  the employee during the period of suspension. It would mean that the employee would not be presumed guilty until he proved his innocence before the authority. If an amendment were adopted along those lines, he would be presumed innocent until he came to the court. If the court found to its satisfaction that his conduct warranted deregistration, then that would come into force, but the employee would not be unduly penalized by the loss of income, which is the big distinction in these two clauses. I ask the Minister in all sincerity to consider the question of a summary suspension applicable to both employer and employee with deregistration not becoming effective until an appeal to the court had been heard. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>.- The- more the Opposition examines this bill the more satisfied it is that its reference to the measure as a shipowners&#39; bill was fully justified. Every time the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> finds himself in a bit of a jam, where it can be shown that he is discriminating in favour of the employer, he immediately retreats and says, Xi This may appear to be favorable to the employer, but it is done in the interests of the worker &#34;. When we examine the bill we can see how much it favours the worker - according to the Minister. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is perfectly true that the authority has the power to suspend the licence or permit of the employee to work on the waterfront, and that he has the right of appeal if he feels that he is aggrieved by the decision. Then, if the court decides that his appeal is justified and upholds it, the Minister said that the worker is paid back to the time of the suspension. But the Minister did not intimate that the pay that the worker receives for his lost time is not the normal pay received by a waterside worker when employed, but is the attendance money. According to the Minister that is meting out justice to the employee, although the court upholds his appeal. The worker gets 24s. a day back to the date of suspension, hut to-day a waterside worker on the present rate of pay can earn the equivalent of attendance money in two and a half hours. Yet the Minister argues that it is dealing fairly with the worker to give him two and a half hours pay for each day on which the suspension lasts. That is rather a peculiar attitude to adopt. </para>
        <para>My colleagues have drawn attention to the discrimination between the employer and the employee. Again the Minister says, &#34; If we took action to suspend the licence of the stevedoring company to operate on the waterfront, it would mean the loss of employment for some waterside workers &#34;. Everybody knows full well that a waterside worker is not always employed by the same company. There is a rotation system operating on the waterfront. If it were possible to suspend the licence of a stevedoring company, it would not necessarily mean that the waterside worker would be out of work for any period. He could transfer to another stevedoring operator, as would be the case with the operation of the rotary system. </para>
        <para>It is rather interesting to note that the Minister laid great stress on the fact that these companies could be heavily fined and that the fine ranges from &#163;100 to &#163;1,000. If that fine were imposed upon an individual, it would be regarded as severe, but the stevedoring operators would only laugh at such a penalty. It would not impose any hardship upon them at all. As a matter of fact, lie stevedoring operator is not the real employer of the waterside worker. He acts as the agent for the shipping companies because the stevedoring operator is allied to or is a subsidiary of the big shipping cartel that operates around the Australian coast. </para>
        <para>Everybody knows that the profits that the shipping companies are making at present amount not to just a few thousands of pounds, but to millions of pounds. Those profits are extorted from the Australian producer and the Australian consumer. If a shipping company is penalized under the provisions of this measure, and if it finds the penalty in some sense burdensome, all it has to do is to increase its freight rates to recoup the amount of the fine. This Government will not object to that. It says, &#34; We must not interfere with profits, and we must not control freights. We must not make the shipowners and stevedoring operators prove a case for the imposition of higher rates, because that would be interfering with free enterprise&#34;. The result is that in reality the employer will not be penalized at all. It is idle to suggest that a penalty of &#163;100 to &#163;1,000 will deter a stevedoring operator from engaging in some practice that will probably result in his making a profit much greater than the amount of a fine that might he imposed upon him, even were he judged guilty by the court of a contravention of the provisions of this legislation. </para>
        <para>Another point is that no individual person connected with a stevedoring company, or dependants of such a person, will suffer as a result of the imposition of a fine upon the company. If, however, a waterside worker is penalized, his family immediately suffers. </para>

            <para>- The Minister says he can appeal immediately. What happens if he does? The Minister has said that if the court upholds the appeal he will be paid for the period of his suspension. &#91; ask the Minister whether it is not a fact that if a waterside worker has been suspended for a period, and his appeal is then upheld, he will be paid only the attendance money for the days on which he was suspended, being equivalent to payment for two and a half hours work each. day. Does the Minister regard that as just and fair treatment? If a man&#39;s licence to work is suspended, which is really what will happen under the provisions of this legislation, and if the court subsequently upholds his appeal, then in order to do justice to that man he should be recompensed for any pay that he may have lost during the suspension period. </para>

            <para>- Let us at least know what we are arguing about. As I understand it, if the waterside worker appeals immediately against his suspension, the practice will be to defer the suspension until the appeal is heard. He can, therefore, continue to work until the appeal . is heard. Then, if his suspension is not confirmed by the court, he has not suffered any loss, hut if it is confirmed, the suspension then operates. </para>

            <para>- Let us consider what the Minister has said. For a start, he did not say with any certainty that that is the position. He said that it is what he believes to be the position. Furthermore, does the Minister suggest that the court works so rapidly in these matters that a man can appeal immediately? To whom does he appeal? He would even have to lose time in order to lodge his appeal. He would not be able to lodge it at his place of employment, where he is suspended from work. No matter how expeditiously the appeal is dealt with, he must suffer some loss of time. So I say that if his appeal is upheld subsequently by the court, he should be recompensed so that for the whole period of his suspension he is paid at the rate at which waterside workers in employment are normally paid. That is the only just and fair way of dealing with the situation. </para>

        <para>To show that it is no exaggeration to suggest that the stevedoring  companies  are agents of the shipping companies, we have only to refer to an address given on the 29th January last by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> G.

        <para class="block">That gentleman is one of the employers&#39; own authorities. If that is the position, why does not the Government give power to the proposed stevedoring authority to deal with the stevedoring companies? Why is the authority not empowered to. deal with them summarily, as it is in the case of waterside workers, and to suspend the rights of those companies to operate on the waterfront if they are deemed to be guilty of some offence? Let us reject this stupid idea that the imposition of a fine of between &#163;100 and &#163;1,000 is a fair penalty, when compared with the penalty imposed upon a waterside worker by suspending his right to earn his living. </para>
        <para>This is undoubtedly a shipowners&#39; measure and the Minister is merely the agent of the shipowners in this  Parlia-  ment.

          <para>.- I do not suggest that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> has deliberately misled the committee, but if he cares to look at clause 37 he will find that it is not in conformity with the information that he furnished to me when discussing an earlier clause. The Minister said that, if a worker were suspended, he could appeal immediately. The suggestion was that his case could be determined immediately and that he would be paid attendance money. Clause 37 (1.) reads - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Where the registration of a person as a waterside worker is cancelled or suspended under the last preceding section, that person may, within fourteen days after the date of the cancellation nr suspension or within such further period as the Court allows, appeal to the Court, by filing a notice of appeal in the prescribed form with the prescribed officer of the Court, against the cancellation or suspension and, upon consideration of any such appeal, the Court may confirm, vary or set aside the cancellation or suspension. </para>

        <para class="block">In the first place, the appeal must be made on a prescribed form, and I assume that the form must he obtained at the court. Then it must be filed with the prescribed officer. That all takes time. Sub-clause (2.) then provides - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I direct attention to the fact that the word used is &#34; may &#34; and not &#34; shall &#34;. Whether or not the suspension is postponed is at the will of the authority, so that, if the authority does not feel disposed to postpone the suspension of the registration, it still operates and some days may elapse before the appeal is heard by the court. Even some weeks may elapse, because there is nothing to suggest that the court will set aside other matters with which it may be dealing so that these appeals may he dealt with expeditiously. </para>
        <para>The worker may lose weeks of work as a result of the suspension of his registration. I cannot find in this measure any provision whereby, if his appeal is upheld, a worker may be recompensed to the extent even of being paid attendance money for the period of his suspension. Even if the Minister is able to show that, under the terms of this measure or some other legislation, the worker may be recompensed by the payment of attendance money, I still say that he is not being given just and fair treatment. Before 1 conclude, let me say that the Minister implied that, if the man appealed, the authority would automatically suspend the cancellation of the registration; but the bill now before us does not say anything of the sort. The word used is &#34;may&#34;. If the Minister wants to make it clear that the operation of the cancellation of registration shall be postponed automatically, he ought to substitute the word &#34; shall &#34; for &#34; may &#34;. That would make the provision accord with the statement that he made in the discussion of the previous clause. </para>

          <para>. - I do not think that this provision will operate unjustly in practice. I am certain that, on reflection, the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> will agree with me on that, especially if he recalls that he was a member of the Government which inserted this provision in the legislation in the first place and saw it in operation for a considerable time. It is true that in this instance no mandatory duty is imposed on the authority, but no such duty was imposed on the board by the legislation which the honorable gentleman supported. I assume that he and his colleagues had the same considerations in mind then as we had in framing this provision. We can conceive of cases where an appeal would be of such a frivolous and vexatious character, designed to interfere with the orderly operation of the system, that the board - or, in this instance, the authority - would feel justified in not entertaining it. But if we have regard to the good sense of those who will handle this job, we can assume that what I understand to be the present practice will be continued. The honorable gentleman has challenged my statement in that connexion as a mere statement  of my understanding. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">If I find that I am wrong in that understanding, I shall try to have the matter corrected by this committee or in another place. My understanding is that, provided a genuine appeal is lodged, the practice is to defer forthwith the operation of the suspension, and then to deal with the appeal. If, when the appeal is heard, it is found that the suspension was improperly awarded, there is no question of any loss hy the appellant, unless he has delayed the lodging of his appeal. </para>
        <para>While I am on my feet, I should like to mention another provision, for the information of the honorable member for Werriwa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam).</inline> When we were talking a little earlier about the question of differential treatment - it could be argued that that is continued in this provision - I stressed that, in the case of the suspension of a stevedoring company, there is involved, not only the company, but also the employees - perhaps entirely guiltless employees. But I did not stress that the people whose goods were being handled by the stevedoring company might be put to quite serious loss if , as a result of action taken against the company, the despatch of their goods were delayed for any length of time. So I take the liberty to mention that fact now in passing, because I think it shows that although, on the surface, there may appear to be differential treatment and a lack of balance of justice, what has been done provides a practical answer to the kind of questions with which the authority will have to deal. </para>

          <para>.- We object to clause 37, despite the fact that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> says that it reproduces section 25 of the 1949 act, which was enacted by the Chifley Government. The honorable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hamilton)</inline> interjects to say that the clause re-enacts that section word for word. It does not re-enact it word for word. Most of the words of the section are re-enacted, but the words that have been altered are the significant words. True it is that the words &#34; may &#34;, &#34; suspension &#34;, &#34; cancellation &#34;, and other words are re-enacted, and that the discretion which was in the hands of the hoard will, under this clause, remain in the hands of the authority. But the point is that section 25 of the- 1949 act applied alike to employer and employee, whilst clause 37 of this bill applies to employees only. In case you have not the 1949 act before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> let me remind you that it provided that a person aggrieved by a decision of the board could appeal against the decision.

            <para>- The Minister says that the provision was unworkable. It was unworkable only because, when the High Court gave its decision on the 30th April, 1953, the Government took no steps then to make it workable. Presumably the Government is taking step? now which it believes will make the provision workable. Those steps could have been taken in the budget session of 195S or in any session after that. In fact, they should have been taken by a Government which read the decisions of the High Court or the reports of the Stevedoring Industry Board. On page 9 of the fourth report of the Stevedoring Industry Board for the year ended the 30th June, 1953 - I admit that that report was not presented to the Parliament as promptly as it should have been - it is made quite clear that, as a result of the decision of the High Court, the system of discipline against employers broke down and that the whole of the disciplinary procedure was thrown into disbalance. The Government has known  for three years that this provision is unworkable, but only now is it taking steps to insert workable provisions in the legislation. </para>

            <para>- I shall not repeat what I have said, even for the benefit of the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Eric Harrison),</inline> who has just come out of his torpor. He comes into the chamber only to sleep.  His  slumbers will reverberate more resoundingly through Whitehall shortly. The Government cannot take refuge in the fact that the provision was unworkable. The High Court said that it was unworkable insofar as it did not make it specific that a company could be disciplined, deregistered, fined, or whatever you like, because of its failure to supervise employees. The High Court said that the word &#34; unfit &#34; as applied by the 1949 act to a company applied to the company&#39;s financial capacity, not to its managerial responsibility. So, as I have said, the Government cannot take refuge in the fact that the provision was unworkable, because it could have been made workable at any time during the last three years. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Now we point out that the Government, in the first action that it has taken to make the provision workable as regards discipline for employers, has differentiated between employers and employees. In clause 37, it has retained those provisions of section 25 of the 1949 act which applied to employees and it has disregarded those which applied to employers. As the honorable member for Darebin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. W. Holt)</inline> argued so convincingly, there will be no equality before the law in the stevedoring industry. Employers and employees will not come before the new Commonwealth Industrial Court in equal positions. If the registration of an employee is cancelled or suspended by the authority, he may then appeal to the court. If he appeals, the authority may suspend, hut is not obliged to suspend, the operation of the cancellation or suspension of the registration. If the court decides that the registration has been improperly suspended or cancelled, the employee may go back to work on the waterfront. But the Minister has not yet succeeded in pointing to any provision for the payment of compensation to the employee in respect of the period of wrongful suspension. On the other hand, under clause 35, the employer may be brought before the court, but until and unless the Industrial court says that the employer shall be de-registered, he suffers no penalty whatsoever. The Minister has now suggested that it will be unfair to penalize or suspend an employer because of the hardship imposed on other people. He does not suggest that there will be any hardship to the shareholders, because, after all, they are shipping companies; he does not suggest that there will be any hardship to the waterside workers, because, after all, they are allotted by the authority to the stevedoring companies, and if the number of those companies is reduced, there are still other companies available. And surely it is not necessary to give immunity to the stevedoring companies in order to protect the rights of consignors and consignees. They have their remedies, and the stevedoring companies would not he precluded, by de-registration, from delivering goods which have already been delivered into their hands. They would be precluded only from continuing stevedoring operations, from putting things into ships and taking things out of ships, but if goods are already in their warehouses they can and should, of course, complete the delivery of them. Therefore, we point out that clause 37 continues this differentiation which was introduced in clauses 35 and 36. It will ensure that there is a. penalty on the employees pending the hearing of an appeal against a suspension. No penalty or handicap will be imposed on employers pending proceedings by the authority before the court. Accordingly, we cannot support such differential proceedings as regards the two sides of this particular industry, and differential treatment of them before the court. </para>

          <para>. - If I understood the Minister correctly - and I wish to get this matter straight because it. will solve our problem - he said he thought that if a waterside worker were suspended and an appeal were pending, his suspension would be lifted until the determination of the appeal. It seems to me that this is a question upon which we should be clear. While the debate was continuing, I examined the amendment to the industrial arbitration legislation, which was mentioned this evening, and it does not touch upon this question at all. That amendment provides that the commission shall determine the attendance money. The authority may suspend it. Application for lifting of the suspension may be dealt with by the court, but the court may not then make retrospective its decision on attendance money beyond the date of the lodging of the application for its restoration. That is quite a different matter altogether. If the Minister says that he will deal with this matter in another place in such a fashion as to give effect to the point of view which he has put to the committee, I think that that will meet our objections. </para>

          <para>. - I propose to move a number of amendments to the clause. It will be quite apparent from the discussion which has taken place earlier that this is one of the key provisions in the legislation. It provides for the engagement in special circumstances of unregistered waterside workers, and it raises what we have come to describe as the supplementary labour provisions. The first amendment which I shall propose is in the nature of a rather pleasant surprise packet to honorable gentlemen opposite. Strong criticisms have been voiced by them of the supplementary labour provisions. When I met in Melbourne recently the representatives of the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and of the Waterside Workers Federation, great emphasis was placed upon this clause as one of the objectionable provisions in the bill. I pointed out at the time that what we propose in relation to supplementary labour follows closely the recommendations of the Tait committee of inquiry and includes, so far as we have been able to contrive, the safeguards which that committee suggested should a system of supplementary labour bp introduced. It was put to me that two principal objections to these provisions are held by the trade union movement. The first is that they appear to violate the strongly held Labour principle of one-man-one-job. An objective examination of the provisions in the measure and a consideration of their intention, should quickly dispose of any argument in that regard. We have already made clear that these provisions are to come into operation only in abnormal circumstances where there is a bankup of cargo in a particular port and it appears that more than five days will elapse before that bank-up of cargo can be cleared. </para>

            <para>- We shall como to that. That is the second barrel of objection. Having regard to the fact that we propose to provide specifically that this work force may be used only at week-ends and after five o&#39;clock in the evening, its use can hardly be said to violate the principle of onemanonejob. Certainly more casual employment would be available to persons in other jobs, but I should he surprised to learn that there is any serious trade union objection to that, because it is common knowledge that tens of thousands, and perhaps hundreds of thousands, of trade unionists  take  casual work of one kind or another, either at week-ends or in the evening. </para>

        <para>The second objection is the one to which the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> has given voice. It is the fear that this supplementary work force will be used as a strikebreaking force or, as he puts it, as a scab force. There are two quick answers to that proposition. One is that, by statute, these persons will be precluded from working other than at the times I have mentioned, so they could hardly be an effective substitute work force. The other is that we shall make provision in the legislation for the Waterside Workers Federation- to take these persons in as members of the union. So, on the one hand, there will be a lack of capacity to use them during regular working hours, and on the other, an opportunity for the union to include them amongst its members if it so wishes. I shall not elaborate those answers, because I have given them to those persons who put to me the other point of view. However, it is at the moment quite apparent that whatever might be the logical strength of the answers to the fears that are held, concern is felt outside the Waterside Workers Federation itself. On Monday, I had a further conference - though I suppose it was really in the form of a deputation - with representatives of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, led by the  President,  the Senior Vice  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gil</inline> Hayes. I was informed that they had been in touch, on this particular point, with a number of other members of the interstate executive. </para>

            <para>- They went pretty well, as the honorable gentleman will find out if he has the patience to hear me. These gentlemen proposed that the Government defer the operation of this supplementary labour provision until such time as the Minister shall declare, but not earlier than the beginning of next year. The reason given was that the trade union movement was concerned about these unusual provisions; that we were setting up a new authority which would not become familiar with the conditions in the industry until some time had passed; and that we were taking power in other parts of the bill to do various things in relation to waterfront operations which might have the effect of reducing the need for a supplementary work force, or at least reducing its size. Moreover, it was submitted  that  there were very good reasons for marking time on the implementation of this particular provision until the authority had a clearer and more realistic picture of the problems ahead. </para>

        <para>Frankly, I do not believe that the authority would have rushed in with any impracticable proposals, or in such a manner as to damage the interests of members of the federation, but I said that if it would ease the concern expressed by responsible representatives of the trade  union movement I would, in keeping with the spirit of the other amendments that I have introduced, recommend to Cabinet the adoption of the suggestion. Having had Cabinet&#39;s approval, 1 obtained this morning the endorsement of my colleagues of the Government parties. Therefore, I am now in a position to move the first of five amendments to this clause. I think that the provision is fair enough. </para>

          <para>. - We oppose this clause with all the vigour that we possess because  it  creates in an industry a supplementary force which will work between 5 p.m. and midnight, and on Saturdays and Sundays. The whole effect of it will he to invite people to do a day&#39;s work between 8 a.m. and. 4 p.m., and to work for another employer from 5 p.m. till midnight. Then they will be expected to return to work fresh the next day at S a.m. Some people will do this, not because they want to help the waterfront or the stevedoring industry, but because, in the main, either one thing or the other has actuated them; either they are not getting enough money for the work that they are doing between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., or their greed takes them into an industry such as this where they will supplement their earnings.  I  cannot understand legislation of this character. To invite-men to work from Monday to Friday  in  one industry,  seek employment in another industry on Saturday and Sunday, and to go back to their own job on the Monday is to destroy efficiency. It is all very well for Government supporters to say that it is done extensively to-day. I do not agree with that statement. There are great government authorities in this country which will dismiss a man who engages in any industry other than that in which he is employed by the government. Let honorable members make no mistake about that. Can a man be expected to work  efficiently  on Saturday and Sunday if he has worked efficiently from Monday to Friday <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> some other job? Government supporters have spoken in favour of efficiency in industry. If there is one way of killing efficiency, it is by inviting men to come into the waterside industry under the conditions set out in this bill. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Under this bill the waterside worker will be required to work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; somebody else will come in and do his job from 5 p.m. to 12 midnight; then the waterside worker will be expected to go hack for the dog watch. 1 do not know anything that is calculated to upset the industry more than is this provision. If we are to adopt this sort of arrangement to meet spasmodic conditions prevailing in this industry, it is time for the remainder of Australian industry to examine carefully what is to be done. </para>
        <para>Honorable members may have read in this afternoon&#39;s issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the labour situation in the port of Melbourne to-day. According to the report, the number of men in receipt of attendance money was the greatest in the last two years. In fact, 2,035 waterside workers received attendance money at the rate of 24s. a day because work was not available for them. The representatives of the shipping companies explained that the situation was due to the mid-winter slump in trade together with the effects of the import restrictions. More than 1,700 waterside workers were in receipt of attendance money in Melbourne yesterday. As against that, the number of waterside workers who offered for employment in Sydney to-day was 363 less than the requirement. Does any honorable  member suggest  that 363 additional men should have been engaged in Sydney at 5 o&#39;clock this afternoon to work the ships, when more than 2,000 men were paid attendance money in another port? I hear a Government supporter say that it does not work out that way. Of course, it does! I invite the honorable member to examine the report upon which this bill is based. Obviously he has not read it. The Tait committee made its investigations and found that the question of transfer of labour had been before the court since 1950. An application had been made by both the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation. The committee found that the court had not done anything in the matter since 1950 and stated that for seven years the question of transfer had never been looked at. </para>
        <para>For many years, I was a leading member of an organization whose members were required to handle seasonal production. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson)</inline> knows something about this matter. He is aware that in the wheat season, we had to provide an additional 300 men in the southern districts. We had also to provide an additional 500 men in the northern districts when the transport of wheat began. What was done? We had the central force from which we drew our men on transfer. It was a wonderful provision. The department met the situation, and provided accommodation at the various points so that the casual labour could be handled at the required centres and shifted from the north to the west, to the south, as required. No one will convince me that we shall get peace in the waterfront industry or satisfactory control of man-power in it until the court lavs down a set nf conditions that will result from the application of employers and employees in relation to transfer conditions and transfer allowances. I nut it to the representatives of the graziers that they would not get their shearing done if it were not for the organized labour of shearers moving from the north to the south. </para>
        <para>The problem of handling the Tasmanian apple crop is frequently mentioned in this chamber. Could not labour to load the apple crop be organized in the same  way  as the shearing industry is  organized?  Could not facilities be provided for waterside workers who were  prepared to transfer in the peak season to theTasmanian apple ports? If the men are assured of accommodation when they arrive, I am prepared to say that the Tasmanian shippers would he able to obtain sufficient waterfront labour for their purposes. But until the court lays down a code for conditions of transfer, the labour difficulty will not be solved. The union and the employers must have their award in this field. The Government is making provision for the employment of a supplementary labour force on the wharfs at a time when other great industries are working overtime and the Minister tells us that in point of fact, there are more jobs available than there arc men to fill them. </para>
        <para>The amendment proposed by the Minister provides that this clause shall not come into operation until the 1st January next. &#34;Why did he not adopt the recommendation of the Tait committee in this respect? Why did he not set this part of the bill aside until the court has determined the claim before it? Honorable members will recall that in its declaration on this subject, the Tait committee laid some blame at the door of the Government for the failure to have this award made. I contend that clause 40 should not be put into operation until the court gives its decision and we force upon the industry - the union and the employers - the responsibility to do the same thing as we have to do in other industries - that is, provide facilities for people who are prepared to transfer for the purposes of employment. When that is done, we shall have no trouble in obtaining labour for Tasmanian ports in the apple season or for Queensland ports in the sugar season. The waterside workers, like railwaymen and everybody else, will meet the labour requirements, provided transport, is offered and accommodation is available on their arrival. The waterside workers are human beings like other workers. I am convinced that this provision should not operate until the court has given its decision on conditions of transfer in accordance with the claim before it. </para>

          <para>.-I have listened carefully to the speech of the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison),</inline> and although it is well known that I am not an authority on waterside workers I think that even one who does not know anything about the subject would know, on reading the bill, that the honorable gentleman is wide of the mark. He referred to a report in this afternoon&#39;s issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> to the effect that many waterside workers were paid attendance money to-day because employment was not available for them. He mentioned that matter as if it had some relation to this clause. He did everything hut read the part of the clause that deals with the conditions under which the supplementary work force can be engaged. The clause reads as follows :  -  (1.) Where the Authority is of the opinion - (a) that, by reason of the sudden occurrence of an unusually heavy demand . . . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">There is not now an unusually heavy demand for waterside workers in Melbourne. As the honorable member has stated, the mid-winter slump is being experienced and the effect of the import restrictions is being felt and, therefore, there is a surplus of waterside workers. However, I direct attention again to the relevant sub-clause which reads as follows :  -  (1.) Where the Authority is of the opinion - </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>that, by reason of the sudden occurrence of an unusually heavy demand for the performance of stevedoring operations at a port or by reason of interruptions in stevedoring operations at a port, the expeditious, safe and efficient performance of stevedoring operations at the port is likely to be prejudicially affected for a period of at leastfive days; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>that the circumstances are not such as to warrant an increase in the quota for the port or the registration of waterside workers at the port under sub-section (2.) of section thirty of this Act, the Authority may declare, by instrument in writing, that until the declaration ceases to be in force, the employment of unregistered waterside workers at the port is, in the public interest, permitted in accordance with this section. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">That means that the circumstances referred to would probably be of short duration only. It is only in such emergencies that the extra work force would be employed. It certainly could not be employed, under this measure, when there was a surplus of waterside workers, as instanced by the honorable member for Blaxland in submitting his case. It has always appeared to me that the honorable member is tremendously fair in the attitude that he evinces in debates in this chamber, and I have appreciated hearing him on various occasions; but on this point he is very wide of the mark. As a person who has nothing to do with watersiders or the waterfront, I think it is only right that I should direct attention to his error. </para>

          <para>. - I am amazed that such a provision as this should be included in the bill. The honorable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> a moment ago pointed out what a foolish thing this is. The provision is to operate only when there is an unusual volume of shipping in a port, and when there is an insufficiency of waterside workers to do the necessary work, thus necessitating the employment of extra men. The important point I want to put to the Minister for labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> is that this provision is the very thing which will lead to waterfront stoppages. My reason for making that statement is that no waterside worker, any more than a coal miner or any other trade unionist, will concur in a system which means that he will work at ordinary rates of pay during the day whilst men from outside the industry are brought in to do night shifts and week-end work at higher rates of pay. All I can say is that whoever was responsible for this clause has a very poor knowledge of the trade union movement and of the psychology of the workers in industry. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I pointed out during the secondreading debate, this provision postulates that when a port is busy, when there are more ships than can be handled by the normal pool of waterside workers, the waterside workers will work from 8 a.m. to  5  p.m. at ordinary rates of pay and outside workers will take over the night shifts and week-end work at penalty rates. The men who will be brought on as the extra work force will obviously be men who are not accustomed to doing the work of waterside workers, because otherwise they would not offer for such work. </para>

            <para>- It may operate in New Zealand, but that does not mean that it is a suitable provision for the Australian waterfront, or that it will do the job that the Government thinks it will do. In any event I am not talking about New Zealand, I am talking about the Australian waterfront. A few years ago a contractor was speaking to me about men engaged in the building industry. He said that they worked a five-day week and on Saturdays and Sundays did other jobs at high rates of pay, with the result that when they came back to their normal jobs on Monday they were not able to do them efficiently. And these men were men accustomed to doing the kind of work that they engaged in as an extra source of income on Saturdays and Sundays ! But, in this instance, that will not be the position. The men who will be employed to do the night shifts and the week-end work on the waterfront will not be men who are used to waterside work. They will be outsiders. I can tell the Minister that at least 100 men will be needed to work on the hatches of any fair-sized ship, and I believe that the Minister has another think coming if he thinks for a moment that it will be possible to get sufficient men from outside the industry to handle the work on night shifts efficiently. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There is another objection to the provision. The Minister has said that this provision is to operate only in respect of work to be done between 5 p.m. and midnight on a working day. That is to say, the outside workers will not be allowed to work on ordinary shifts. The Minister knows very well that work after 5 p.m. attracts higher rates of pay than the normal, and that work on Saturdays and Sundays attracts still higher rates of pay. So the waterside workers are to be asked to work for the ordinary daily or hourly rates of pay, and, after they have knocked off at 5 o&#39;clock, Monday to Friday, or at noon on Saturday, outsiders are to como in and get the cream in the way of higher wages. </para>

            <para>- In adequate numbers! And what does the Minister call adequate numbers? If he knows anything of work on the waterfront, or looks at the newspapers, he will know that on occasions there are not sufficient men for night shifts. Does the Minister mean to tell me that if there are not sufficient men to handle the night shifts the employers will have a ship standing idle during the day, when pay rates are normal, and work it at night when pay rates are high? </para>

            <para>- My answer is that this provision will make the position worse, not better. I quite appreciate the problem that the Minister faces, but I appreciate also that it is necessary for the quota of watersiders in a port to be such as will ensure that each of them will get a reasonable amount of work, and also that when a big bank-up of shipping occurs extra work will be necessary. But waterside workers will not relish having to work at ordinary rates of pay during the day, when there is a bank-up of shipping, while outside workers receive high rates of pay for extra work outside normal hours. If the Minister  thinks  that this provision is the only way in which to overcome the problem, I tell him very definitely that this is one of the things that the waterside workers will object to more than anything else. In saying that, I point out to the  committee  that I am not, and never have been. one of those who advocate stoppages of work. But I know the feeling of the men in relation to such matters as this, and I know that they will object very strongly to this provision. </para>

            <para>- I suggest that the shipowners of this country cannot justly expect men to do the work wanted for the greater part of the year and then, when things are busy for a week or two. when there is a rush of shipping, agree to the employment of outside men at high rates of pay. The waterside workers would not agree to such a situation.  We  all know that there is a big rush of shipping into Australian ports, with goods from overseas, at times when there are big seasonal cargoes to be lifted for the return voyage. That occurs, for instance, after wool sales and during the wheat export season. But there are periods of the year when there is not a big flow of shipping. In fact, the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> told us of the position in Melbourne, where a seasonal slump was the reason why the men were getting only attendance money. These waterside workers are very human persons, and they hold that if they have to suffer during the seasonal slumps, and get attendance money only, when there is no slump the shipowners should be prepared to take a bit of a kick as the men have to take it in the slump periods. The waterside workers do not want the kicks. </para>

            <para>- I come now to clause 43. This outrageous clause provides that the Waterside Workers Federation is to he compelled to admit anybody to its organization, even if the rules provide otherwise. The rules are not to operate when they are contrary to the decision of the authority, which is backed up by the Government to compel the Waterside Workers Federation to admit anybody registered as a waterside worker by the authority. It means that anybody around the waterfront of Australia can be registered as a waterside worker by the authority and automatically the Waterside Workers Federation must admit him to membership of the union. Not only must such men be admitted, but the authority will determine what fees they shall pay. That will not be decided by the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I ask the Minister : Is it not a fact that these men who are to be forced on to the Waterside Workers Federation will be able to exercise full membership rights during the period of their membership? They will be able to vote in ballots. The Government and the authority, which acts on behalf of the shipowners and the Government - because they are both employers&#39; representatives - will be able to determine the future of this union. If fees are accepted from them and they are admitted to membership, they must be given the full rights of membership. </para>
        <para>This clause provides for supplementary labour. It is a scab force - and the Minister himself admits that - which will be used on the waterfront whenever there is a hold-up or an accumulation of shipping, even if that accumulation should occur as the result of an industrial dispute. An invidious position would then be created. The Minister seems to think that as long as a man is a member of the union, he ought to be permitted to work, even if that is against the decision of the union. Because he is a member of the union, in the eyes of the Minister he does not become a scab worker. That is the Minister&#39;s opinion. </para>
        <para>What a ridiculous situation we are reaching! The Waterside Workers Federation could declare that certain work should not he performed because of some dispute arising on the waterfront, but one section of its members, which has been forced upon the union by the authority could go to work against the decision and the wishes of its own organization. It is an utterly ridiculous position. Therefore, I say to the Minister that, in preventing us from having a full discussion on the preceding clauses of the bill dealing with supplementary labour, he did not give the Opposition and other honorable members an opportunity to examine this clause thoroughly and to show exactly how vicious it is to provide for a supplementary labour force on the waterfront. The Minister knows full well that the reason the employers want a register of supplementary labour is because they want to hold that over the &#34;Waterside &#34;Workers Federation as a threat. In the event of the union striking or holding up shipping, because it has what it regards as a justifiable grievance that has not been rectified, this supplementary labour force will be ready to take over the work. That is the idea of the Government, of the Minister and of the authority. To show how much reliance can be placed on the word of the Government and the Minister in regard to protecting the interests of the waterside workers, why does not the Minister admit that, whilst there is a provision in the bill that for 28 days after the use of supplementary labour, the waterside, workers- </para>

            <para>- I was pointing out under clause 43, which we are now discussing, that where the supplementary labour is used on the waterfront, the Minister believes that the Government has done sufficient by giving to the waterside workers, whose employment may be affected by the use of this force, a guaranteed wage for the following 28 days. But what is the guaranteed wage? It is ten times the daily appearance money for four periods of seven days. That means that for four weeks after the use of supplementary labour, the waterside workers will be guaranteed &#163;12 a week. That is 13s. a week less than the prevailing basic wage. Does the Minister regard that as just and fair? Anybody who considered the idiotic proposals put forward by this Government could only come to the conclusion that it was doing so deliberately to cause a head-on collision with the waterside workers and the trade union movement. Anybody who has had any experience in industry would know that the supplementary labour force will never operate efficiently on the waterfront in this country nor will the trade union movement permit it to function. To suggest that the Government can put people on a register, and by putting them on a register the &#34;Waterside &#34;Workers Federation has to admit them to membership--- </para>

It is an outrageous proposal and the Labour party naturally, is strongly opposed to it. it will become law by the brutal majority of the shipowners&#39; representatives in this Parliament, but that does not mean it will become an effective law. The ships must still be worked and cargo will still have to be discharged from and loaded on to the ships. If the waterside workers and the trade union movement propose to take any action at all to defeat the will of the Government and the shipowners in this country, the Labour Opposition will support them in every possible way. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Ward)</inline> finds something outrageous in a provision that a union can be compelled to admit to membership some person that the union itself has not decided to accept as a member. I am interested to hear him say that, and I should be even more interested to learn that that was a point of view held generally by Opposition members, because, unless I am very much mistaken, what this hill provides is precisely what the Cahill Labour Government of New South Wales provided when it introduced the compulsory unionism legislation in that State. It forced unions to take into membership people who were subject to the compulsory unionism legislation. Therefore, whatever gloss honorable gentlemen opposite may care to put upon it, the principle has been established - and Opposition members have not merely accepted it; they have propounded it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honorable member for East Sydney has suggested that the men who are thus admitted to membership of a union might have a right to vote at union meetings, and might have the same rights as other union members, even though they are (usual employees, temporarily or even rarely engaged. Nothing that this Government has proposed would prevent the union from promulgating its own rules in relation to persons who came into the union as a result, of the provisions of the legislation covering the supplementary labour scheme. Such rules as might In- dmided upon specifically for supple mentary workers could be challenged before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission only on the ground that they were unreasonable, or on some similar ground. There is nothing to prevent the union accepting persons engaged as supplementary workers as members of the union and prescribing reasonable rules as to the rights, privileges, opportunities and responsibilities that the supplementary worker should enjoy or accept. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for East Sydney took the opportunity provided by his line of argument on this clause to make a general attack on the supplementary labour provisions. I have indicated earlier the reasons why -we believe such a scheme to be both practicable and desirable. I have already pointed out that this scheme is operating, without causing any upset to trade union thinking, in New Zealand, and in the United Kingdom. It operated here, under the blessing of a Labour government, during the war years, when it was felt necessary to supplement the work force on the waterfront. Quite apart from its merits, which need not be argued further at this stage, I have already proposed an amendment to the bill which has the effect of deferring the operation of the provisions until the 1st January, 1957, at the earliest, which will leave an interval during which the authority may consider fully any possible alternatives which may provide a solution to the problem that the supplementary labour scheme is designed to solve. </para>

          <para>. -  If the Government wished to see tho Australian Council of Trades Unions ranged behind the Waterside Workers Federation, it could not have done anything more calculated to achieve that, end than introduce a hill containing a clause such as the one that we are now debating. Tho Australian Council of Trades Unions represents every union in Australia, with the exception of the Australian Workers &#39;Union, to which I shall refer in a moment. If the Government expects the Australian Council of Trades Unions to disagree with the Waterside Workers Federation&#39;s opposition to the bill, it must expect the council to agree to- a proposal that will give the Government the right to force unions to accept tol membership people who are not fit to be in the unions. </para>

            <para>- The bill makes it perfectly clear that the union will have no say as to the people who will be admitted to its membership. In introducing this legislation, which will force unions to accept, as a member any person engaged by an employer in the industry, it is taking the first step towards introducing the genera&#93; principle that a union has no right to determine who shall be admitted to its membership and who shall not. It follows that it would have no right to expel a member for misconduct or for a breach of union discipline or union rules, or for working at rates of pay less than- those provided in the award. </para>

            <para>- 1  shall continue, and the Minister may call ii incitement, or do what he likes about it, but the Australian Council of Trades Unions Congress will not accept this kind of legislation. I shall repeat my remarks, and you can call it incitement to disobey the law if you want to. Rut let me tell you this: This is a law you cannot enforce. You will never enforce it, because the Australian Council of Trades Unions congress must support the Waterside Workers Federation in i&#62; nation-wide stoppage in protest against a law that allows a government to tell a union how much it can charge in subscription fees. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister going to tell the Australian Workers Union that because a shearer works for only three or four months of the year he cannot be charged the full annual subscription laid down by that union? There is no provision in the union rules for any subscription but an annual one. If the Australian Council of Trades Unions allows this kind of legislation to be accepted without demur, it will not be long before the meat workers union, some members of which are casual workers in a seasonal occupation, will be told by this Government, with the present legislation as a precedent, that it has no right to fix subscription rates which the Government believes are not reasonable. What right has the Government to tell a union what fees it shall charge? What right has it to say what persons a union will admit to membership? I say, therefore, that the congress of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, which will meet next week, should take heed of the threat to the whole structure of trade unionism in this country that lies behind this legislation, and should rally its members to the aid of the Waterside Workers Federation in order to prevent this kind of legislation being put on the statute-book. The very fact that when such a reference is made, the Minister, sitting at the other side of the table, attempts to intimidate me and to prevent me from saying what he knows is true is indicative of his intentions in relation to the Waterside Workers Federation. If he is prepared to come here and to attempt to intimidate an elected representative of the people of Australia, we have a fair idea of his real intentions towards the people outside the Parliament who have not the protection of parliamentary privilege. In conclusion, I say that, if ever there was a matter on which the Australian Council of Trades Unions Congress should rally wholeheartedly to support the federation in its fight against this iniquitous measure, it is the clause that we are now considering. </para>

We come to this place, having been chosen to support the institution to which we have been elected. The purpose of a parliament is to prescribe, by a majority decision, the laws that shall govern a democratic society. Of course, not every decision will be acceptable to every member of that parliament, but it will be acceptable to a majority of members. Those members who do not like a certain decision may avail themselves of democratic methods of reversing it, if it is the popular will that it should be reversed. They may campaign against the decision and seek a vote of the people so that they in turn may be in a position of authority and may repeal or amend the legislation in the manner that seems to them to be proper under the circumstances. But if a parliament passes certain legislation, it is a bad thing for one of its members to go out and to incite and inflame people who live in that democracy and encourage them wilfully to disobey what the parliament has, by majority decision, determined. </para>

            <para>- I represent the people who have elected me. When <inline font-style="italic">I cease to</inline> do that they will remove me from this place, and there are not that many shipowners. Irrespective of the degree to which the shipowners might have found the existing legislation to be objectionable, they have obeyed the law and we have not discouraged them from doing so. We have not incited them to disobey the law, and I do not see those honorable members whom I regard as being the more responsible members of the Opposition encouraging people outside the Parliament to disobey the law. Let Opposition members state their case as vigorously and powerfully as they can in the Parliament, but once the Parliament has made a decision, we all have a responsibility to see that the law is obeyed. I have rarely heard a more irresponsible statement than that which has been made to-night by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, who has gone out of his way to incite responsible members of the Australian Council of Trades Unions to cast aside the decision of the Parliament when they meet in congress next week. When I said that the honorable member must accept responsibility for his action, I was referring, not to some penalty imposed by this legislation, but to the responsibility that he: as an elected member of the Parliament, has towards those persons whose trust he has wilfully disregarded. </para>

            <para>- That is the kind of approach that one might expect. What the honorable member said was that this clause represented an intru sion into the management of trade union affairs. Let me tell the committee that this clause just will not work. The honorAble member for Hindmarsh said that the first thing that this clause will do will be to inflame the delegates to the Australian Council of Trades Unions Congress to be held next week - and I shall he one of them - because it cuts across the principles upon which the trade unions first established their organizations. </para>

            <para>- Let me deal with them one at a time. I have only ten minutes in which to speak, and if I chase the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> and others, I shall be wasting my time. The honorable member for Hindmarsh said that the Australian Council of Trades Unions will fight this clause. Legislation which the Minister introduced after this Government assumed office, and which the Australian Labour party opposed, provided that the rules of every union should include a provision for the amount of contribution to he paid by members. Those rules must be accepted by the Registrar of the court. Now the Minister introduces legislation in relation to this industry, in which in the future there will be casual employment, to provide that the </para>

        </continue>
        <para class="block">Stevedoring Industry Authority shall have the right to go to the court to seek a determination in relation to the contribution that shall be paid by casual workers. That was the very thing that the honorable member for Hindmarsh attacked. If the Minister regards as incitement the action of a trade unionist who is a member of this Parliament in urging the members of his union to fight for the things in which, as trade unionists, they believe, there will be a lot of incitement in this Parliament. It is useless for the Minister to use the word. </para>
        <para>These provisions of the hill will not be able to operate unless the present industrial arbitration legislation is amended. At present, a trade union decides, in its own way, under its own rules and in accordance with the law of the land, what the contributions of its members shall be. That rule is submitted to the registrar of the court. If there is anything wrong with the rule, it is returned for revision. The South Australian branch of my union had a rule referred back to it by the registrar within the last six weeks because it infringed a law passed by this Parliament relating to what a union may or may not do in relation to its own affairs. When those of us who have had long years of experience of trade union leadership find a provision of this kind in the bill, it is understandable that we should object to it strongly. The union that I represent had to spend &#163;600 on a special convention called to amend its rules in order to give effect to a measure brought down by this Government. The Waterside Workers Federation was in a similar position. Now it is proposed that if the rules of a union do not make provision for the emergency envisaged by this legislation, the new authority shall have power to request the court to draw up new rules for contributions by members of the union. When trade unionists on this side of the chamber attack provisions such as this, I hope the Minister will nor. use the word &#34;incitement&#34; so freely. </para>

          <para>.- The Opposition opposes this clause for somewhat similar reasons to those on which it based its opposition to clause 43. This clause covers the boycott of waterside workers, and makes prohibitions in respect of certain matters, and also makes it an offence for any person to prevent, hinder, or dissuade persons from doing things which are specified in the clause in paragraphs (a) to <inline font-style="italic">(h).</inline> Sub-clause (2.) provides : - </para>

        <para class="block">Therein we have, unmistakably and clearly, a proposed application of the averment clause to persons who are accused of doing any of the things which the cif use prohibits. The  Opposition  says, first, that the clause is intimidatory and coercive in character. The committee has accepted the provisions contained in clause 40 for the creation of a. supplementary labour force. It was obvious to those  persons  who drafted the bill that, clause 40 was bound to cause the era vest  discontent  on the waterfront and that it would bo strongly resisted by  the waterfront  un;ons. particularly the &#34;Waterside Workers Federation. So, in order tn overcome the expected strong opposition of the Waterside Workers Federation, two clauses have been inserted with the object of coercing and forcing the federation into accepting the supplementary labour force. </para>
        <para>The first such provision is contained in clause 43, the object of which is to compel the union to accept persons as members at a lower fee than would be ordinarily charged to a member. An attempt having been made to tie up the matter of compulsory membership of the union, nomatter how the union may object, the next step is to prevent any action being taken by the union or any of its members to defeat the organization and employment of a supplementary labour forceFinally, there is to be placed upon the person who is charged with an offence arising under the provisions of the clause the onus of proving reasonable cause or excuse. So, there is to be brought into operation a species of law that one finds generally being applied to workers under conditions that are operating todaySuch a provision is contained in theCrimes Act and elsewhere. Where there is expected to be difficulty in proving a charge against a person, the easy way of overcoming the difficulty and ensuring the greatest possible measure of either persecution or prosecution, is to bring into operation an averment provision, which throws upon the accused the responsibility of proving himself innocent of the charge. </para>
        <para>The honorable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Leslie)</inline> this afternoon made a very impassioned speech on liberty and protection of a person&#39;s rights to British justice.  It will be interesting to see how the honorable member reacts to this proposal that persons, who are charged under clause 44, will have to prove their innocence instead of the persons charging them having to prove their guilt. To introduce such a provision into legislation of this description is only to add to the provocation which the legislation is bound to cause. Obviously if the Waterside Workers Federation considers that the creation of a supplementary labour force is detrimental to its economic interest and the maintenance of the living standards and livelihood of its members, it will resist the creation of that force. Because of its resistance it will be prosecuted under clause 44, which provides a penalty, for a body corporate, of &#163;500 - which presumably would be the penalty imposed on the union - and &#163;50 for individual workers. If anything is more likely to create complete disruption of work on the waterfront, I should like to know of it. Clauses of this description  &#171;re designed to coerce, blackmail or force the Waterside Workers Federation into accepting legislation which is inimical to the federation&#39;s interests. Had the gag not been applied to the discussion on clause  40,  we could have said further things on this matter. If one had the opportunity, one could explain very fully how the operation of this clause will disrupt the waterfront. This clause is designed to coerce a worker into a position where anything he does to protect his livelihood and the interests of his organization places him in danger of being charged with an offence, which need not be proved against him. He must prove his innocence. If that sort of condition is to be imposed upon a very difficult and turbulent industry it will result, not in a greater amount of work being done, but in a stoppage at the port where it is applied, and if it is applied at more than one port, a general stoppage throughout Australia. Once again, I feel obliged to remind the committee that coercive legislation cannot produce harmony between employer and employee. Coercion on the part of either the employer or the employee has never improved industrial relations. To use the law to penalize those who resist something that they believe to be an economic evil, and likely to affect their livelihood, merely brings about a condition of affairs that will become more and more inflammatory and, in the end, result not in more expeditious handling of shipping, and a better feeling on the waterfront, but in no ships being handled at all.  1  conclude by warning the committee of the consequences that are bound to flow from the application of clause  44&#39;  to the waterside industry. As a trade union official, I would urge my members to fight against such a clause if it were directed at my organization, and therefore I oppose the clause. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clarey),</inline> indeed almost every Opposition member who has spoken, has said that the bill is likely to foment trouble on the waterfront. As clause after clause is discussed we hear exactly the same thing. Honorable members opposite insist upon forgetting that this country is plagued with the worst waterfront industry in the world, and it is high time that it had a better one. That is why the Government has taken this action. We have plenty of time in which to see whether the proposal will work. It is important that it should work satisfactorily, because every home in this country is affected by conditions on the waterfront - and  95  per cent, of homes are those of workers. </para>

        <para>The Australian waterfront has held us to ransom for  50  years, but not once have Opposition members had a word to say about the unfortunate individual who owns the goods that are being shipped from this country. Their whole interest is centred on the union, but I remind them that the union is not above the law. We have been cursed by a bad waterfront performance from both sides of the industry. For heavens&#39; sake, let us look at the matter in a new light. Surely the unfortunate individual who sends goods overseas, or imports them, has some rights in this matter. It is time that they were protected in this Parliament. We do noi know what will happen when the bill becomes law, but we should try to achieve some form of control because so far not one government has succeeded in giving us an efficient waterfront industry. </para>

          <para>.- Every paragraph of this clause is designed to force men to refrain from taking action to protect their working conditions. Many people believe that waterside work is confined to that which one sees on the surface, but I remind honorable members that those who work below need years of training, because their work involves a great deal of danger. For that reason, if the men on the job believe that the equipment should be repaired before they use it, they should be able to insist upon it. Under the bill, they would be liable to a penalty for doing so. All honorable members are aware that a number of old ships, which were used during the two wars, and have been registered in Panama by American and British companies, have such rotten rigging that its use would endanger the lives of waterside workers. In a case which I recall recently the men said that they would not begin work until repairs were effected. Under this clause such action would bring forth a penalty. The clause mentions &#34; a person &#34; so that the individual waterside worker is to be affected. On the other hand, there is not a word about the shortcomings of the shipping companies. </para>

        <para>One cannot blame the Minister, who was too young at the time, for not remembering what happened in the great maritime strike earlier in our history. However, one can blame the Minister for not studying, before bringing forward this legislation, what has happened in the past. The maritime strike was brought about because the employers of the day tried to impose on the waterside workers the conditions that this bill tries to impose upon them now. The whole of the Australian maritime industry was thrown into idleness, because the men would not stand for that sort of thing. I thought that we had become better educated, and more broadminded, than we were in those days. I did not expect that any government would introduce  a  clause such as this which will render every waterside worker who stands up for his rights liable to a penalty. After all, a man who is not game to stand up for his rights is not worthy of his name. Like the French kings, the Government has never learned the lessons of history. </para>
        <para>Among Government supporters are  a  great many whose ancestors landed in this country in the early days and &#34; squatted &#34; so that they might get a title to land. Subsequently they were granted a licence for about 6s. 8d. and eventually founded a wealthy aristocracy, which believed that the workers should have no rights at all. Many first-class citizens were sent out here as convicts because of the surplus population in Great Britain. Later, free men came out to this country to work under the new conditions and get away from those that existed in the Old Country. Employers of the same type also came here. Those people developed and opened up our country, and the ruling class that emerged then is still with us. I have in mind the old school-tie type, who think that the workers have no rights at all. </para>
        <para class="block">Good  heavens, I have lived amongst them! They are, in  the main, men of  excellent character. Many of  them have  families and, because of the  interest that  they have displayed in their  children&#39;s  education, many of their  children have  entered the professions. This  legislation,  will cause people outside the  WatersideWorkers  Federation to think  that the  members of that organization  belong to  the criminal class. The  restrictions  placed on them by this clause  will, if  they stand up for their rights,  make them  criminals. </para>

        <para class="block">Harold Holt) cannot say has appeared in earlier legislation. It is an entirely new provision. It is an escape clause which permits the authority to avoid all of the responsibilities that it. has in the terms of the earlier sections of the legislation. If this clause were carried, even in its amended form, it would still mean that the authority need not consult the parties. It could make orders without consultation and those whom the orders would affect could be heavily penalized without their having any consultations with the authority at all. </para>
        <para>I do not know how the Minister can argue that this is a reasonable provision to put into the legislation. The bill is bad enough, surely, as it is. The bill, in the preceding . clauses, provides for at least some consultation - limited to people whom the authority thinks fit. I take it that the purpose of the amendment is at. least to give the union an opportunity of nominating a representative with whom the authority may confer. Of course, the authority may not deem it necessary to confer. Therefore, it could avoid the provision for consultation. </para>
        <para>When I refer to this as an escape clause I mean that all the earlier provisions of the bill which have been represented by the Minister as protections for the trade unions viewpoint, being designed to ensure that the union will be consulted, can be torn up as far as the authority itself is concerned. The Opposition can see no merit in this provision at all. As &#91; have said, we think that this is an entirely bad piece of legislation from cover to cover, and this particular provision makes a bad bill even worse because the trade union representatives, if given the right to consult or confer with the authority, may have been able to influence the authority on occasion. The union representatives may have been able to  3how  the authority that some of its orders were ridiculous. But now the authority need not worry about the viewpiont of the organization at all. </para>
        <para>The members of the Waterside Workers Federation are the men who will have to work under this legislation. At least, that is the intention of the Government but, in my opinion, there will be a cessation of work should the Government attempt to apply this legislation. The aim of the Government is to compel the waterside workers to work under this legislation. All of its provisions refer to waterside workers, yet their organization or their officials who are elected to represent them can be completely disregarded by the authority. </para>
        <para>I think that this is an entirely bad provision. It is a new provision, which has been introduced by this Government and it does not appear in any earlier legislation. Therefore, I believe that the Opposition is adopting the right attitude in opposing the clause entirely, even with the amendment submitted by the Minister. There is no doubt that the amendment, that the Minister has put forward represents a sort of sugar-coating for the pill. It might appear that the union had some rights - that it could select representatives to confer with the authority. The union can select its representatives in accordance with the amendment carried by the committee but that amendment will only give the union the right to select representatives. The amendment will not give the union the right to see that it is consulted on any orders made by theauthority. I support the attitude of the Opposition in strongly opposing the provision. </para>

The Minister has taken what we have offered from this side of the chamber in a very commendable spirit, considering the position in which he has been placed by the drafting of this legislation and the little support that he has received from his cohorts on the back benches. I listened to the view that he put, and it sounded reasonable. But I should again like to make the point that I made yesterday, which is that the Minister cannot expect always to be the Minister for Labour and National Service. At some time, certain of the other people who have expressed sentiments such as those expressed last night by honorable members during the adjournment debate last night and by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anderson),</inline> to-night about the waterside workers may be in a position to enforce this legislation. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Here, at the tail end of the bill, we see, finally, the duties and responsibilities that lie on the  26,000  waterside workers who have to face up to their duties to the country by continuing to work on all and every occasion demanded of them; whose union&#39;s rights are to be taken away on all and every possible occasion; who will be expected to sacrifice themselves to the community; who will be paid attendance money only when there is a surplus pf labour and there is no work for them to do ; to whom the community as a whole accepts no responsibility; and to whom, finally, the authority to control their destiny accepts no responsibility. I heard the Minister address to the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline> a criticism that he was being irresponsible in putting the viewpoint of the Labour movement. We on this side of the House  will  continue to put that point of view ; and if the Government continues to produce pieces of legislation like this measure, which contains  34 page3,  of challenge to the trade union movement - the movement which has a record of  60  years of comradeship and constructive developments of the nation - it will be looking for real trouble. </para>

Even if the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> does not approve, I assure him that responsible trade unionists outside tho Parliament have indicated their appreciation of the way in which the Government has permitted this free expression of opinion. </para>

            <para>- I know the sort of use the honorable gentleman would make of that information. All I want to say in respect of this particular provision is that it is what the draftsman would call a saving provision. It is utter nonsense to imagine that any responsible authority would wilfully refuse or omit to carry out the obligations imposed upon it by the rest of the statute and then rely upon this saving provision, in order to validate the action it has taken. This is a saving provision to cover the unforeseeable decision which, by no lack of good faith, but by some unavoidable omission or, perhaps, by some omission which was not brought to notice at the time, has occurred in relation to a particular action of the authority, and under which without a saving provision of this kind the action of the authority might not merely be invalidated and cause inconvenience to the authority itself but might also have the effect of causing inconvenience or loss to people affected by earlier decisions of the authority. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The real safeguard that honorable gentlemen opposite have in this matter, I put to them, is that in the composition of this authority the Government hopes to include a responsbile member of the trade union movement. That has been prescribed in the legislation. I am quite conscious of the fact, along with my colleagues, that it is not going to meet our requirements or the very weighty responsibilities which this legislation creates, if the person whom we appoint as representative of the trade union movement carries no respect and no authority so far as the trade union movement itself is concerned. If that were the case and such a. person were included in the membership of this authority is it to be sensibly assumed that he is going to be a party to wilful acts of omission so as to enable this saving provision to take effect? This is the sort of sensible and reasonable provision made in a bill to avoid any omission made in good faith from invalidating orders which might have important consequences for persons affected by the legislation. It is also designed to meet the situation which, as &#91; said earlier, could arise if one party or the other refused to consult, or deliberately withheld himself from a position of consultation with the authority. That could make the work of the authority completely impracticable. </para>

            <para>- I imagine that in those circumstances the authority would take that into account as one of the important factors bearing on the course it should follow. If it came to the conclusion that had -it gone through the process of consultation  it  would  not  have made the order which led  to a  penalty, then it might very well withdraw the prosecution or remit the penalty,  as  the case might be. If it found  on  examination that that was not really relevant to the course which  it had  followed or had no material bearing  on  it, then I imagine it would allow  tieposition  to remain unchanged. This provision was not one that I had sought deliberately to insert into the legislations I consulted the draftsman in relation to it and after hearing his explanation  I  came to the conclusion that  it  was desirable to have a saving provision  of  this kind in the bill. For that reason  I  am not prepared to accept the request that has been put forward by the Opposition that the clause be deleted. </para>

            <para>- But we are dealing with this Government&#39;s action in connexion with this measure. Now, let us turn to what the Minister referred to as a protection for trade unionists. He said that if one of the parties will not confer, or if one of the persons who are nominated as a representative will not confer, this clause gives the authority the opportunity to proceed. But does not the Minister recognize that no trade union whose members are affected, or are likely to be affected, by an order of the authority, would refuse to confer? That is a ridiculous argument to advance. No responsible trade union would refuse to confer on the making of an order that is going to affect its own members. Therefore, it must be obvious that the intention of the particular clause is not for the purpose of meeting a situation such as that outlined by the Minister, but to give an opportunity to the authority to refuse to confer with the trade union representatives whenever it might desire to do so. Now, the Minister says that there is no danger to the trade union movement because it will have a representative on the authority. He has not told us who has been selected. I understand from my reading of the reports that the Government does not propose to  give  the Waterside Workers Federation the opportunity to select a representative  on  the authority, although they are the men who will be directly affected. Why was that decision made by the Government? Has the Government already selected somebody who is ready to move in as the employees&#39; representative on the authority? Surely the trade union concerned ought to be consulted on the matter of who the representative of the waterside workers on the authority is to be! </para>

            <para>- Because the gentleman appointed to the authority is supposed to protect the interests of the workers. According to the Minister that is the reason for having him there - so that he can protect the interests of the employees. If it is the real intention of the Govern ment that this representative is torepresent the employees and to protect their interests, then the trade union movement is the right body to make theselection, especially the trade union whose members are affected. But theGovernment has no intention of consulting the trade unions. It wants to disregard the trade union movement completely. How will the Minister proceed to make the selection of the gentleman to represent the trade union concerned, with the knowledge that he has in a very limited field ? How will heselect a man, outside the union, who will be qualified to occupy the position of representative of the employees? The men able to judge matters that affect the employees are the men who actually work in the industry, who know conditions in the industry. These men know who isqualified to represent them. </para>

        <para>Why does the Government specifically exclude from membership of theauthority, as the representative of theemployees, any member of the Waterside Workers Federation? It is obvious that the Government has already selected, the members of the authority, and that it i3 waiting for this legislation to be passed, when it will let us know whom it has selected. The Minister should get right out of his head any idea that the trade union movement will be satisfied that because some person has held a position in the trade union movement, or has had some association with the movement, and may be personally approved of by the Minister, he will be acceptable to thetrade union movement. So I say, even at this late stage, that the Government has shown clearly that its intention is not to do anything for the protection of theworkers in the industry. The Minister said, referring to this clause - &#34; This is not the provision I wanted in the legislation.&#34; But he is the Minister who introduced the legislation ! When we were in office we went through every clause of bills that were to be brought before theParliament, and we did not have provisions forced on us, as this provision hasobviously been forced on the Minister.. If he did not want clause 55 in the legislation, who wants it included? I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haddy</inline> and&#39; the shipowners want it in. and because the shipowners want it in the Minister has had to accept it. He has no alternative. Therefore, on the Minister&#39;s own line of argument, it is obvious why every Labour man has to oppose this provision. </para>

            <para>. - I oppose the motion for the third reading of this bill because Parliament has not been afforded an ample opportunity to discuss its provisions. Owing to the ruthless use of the gag, numbers of members of the Opposition have not been given the opportunity to express their profound opposition to this antiLabour and anti-working class piece of legislation. For that reason, this bill should not be read a third time. During the discussion of this measure, many members of the Opposition have been waiting for the opportunity to speak, but they have been unable , to get the call, because when one of them rose the Minister for Labour <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> who, in your absence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> talked about a democratic Parliament, resorted to dictatorial and totalitarian methods to prevent proper discussion of this bill.

I suspect that, in the past, some things have been done that should not have been done, and that the Government is putting them right.

            <para>.This measure is designed to give further assistance to the cellulose acetate flake industry. This industry was established in Australia very largely as a result of the encouragement given to the company concerned by the Chifley Labour Administration, which helped very considerably in the initial stages of the establishment of the industry. The company has been helped substantially since by acts of the Parliament. Honorable members on both sides of the Parliament support the payment of a bounty to enable this product to be produced in Australia at a price that will allow it to compete with similar products sold in this country and produced by big combinations of capital in other parts of the world. Cellulose acetate flake is the material from which another company manufactures rayon yarn. Both the rayon yarn manufacturing company, which depends on the Australian-made cellulose acetate flake, if its price is less than that of the imported product, and the company which manufactures the flake, naturally favour the payment of the bounty. Both companies approached the Tariff Board with a request for assistance to their industries. They have received it in the past. They have now made a further request for help, and the Tariff Board has recommended that it be given by means of bounties. The Opposition supports the measure. Nevertheless,I think we should criticize the frequency with which very large Australian industries seek, through the Parliament, the bounty of the Australian people in the form of financial assistance. In other words, they say to the Australian taxpayers, <inline font-style="italic">en masse, &#34;</inline> Every one of you is expected to pay us something to ensure that our industry will show a profit at the end of the year &#34;. </para>

              <para>- It is quite true, as the honorable member says, that we have a Tariff Board to investigate all these applications. I may say that I am an admirer of the  chairman  of the board, who has great capacity and great industry. We are lucky to have a man of such outstanding qualities as  chairman  of the board. We are fortunate, also, that we have a reasonably good board under such a  chairman.  But, just because we have a very capable Tariff Board to which the captains of very large aggregations of capital can come and state the reasons why the people of Australia should pay them a bounty, it does not necessarily follow that this Parliament should always, meekly and without criticism, either acquiesce in the recommendations of the Tariff Board or accept, willy-nilly, the blandishments and the requests of these concerns. I know that, if Australian industry is to be adequately protected and enabled to help build this great Commonwealth into the powerful nation it is capable of becoming, bounties and duties are, in many instances, inevitable, as they have been in the past. No party has been more generous in providing that assistance than has the Labour party. However, I utter a word of caution and point out that there are in this country many small people who from time to time enter industry and take up all sorts of businesses, but, because in the initial stages of their enterprises they cannot make profits and because the banking institutions controlled by the States and the Commonwealth, as well as private banks, do not see fit to give them the essential financial assistance in the early years of their existence, they topple over by the hundred. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Every year hundreds of them go out of business, but their passing is hardly noticed. Yet those who occupy the treasury bench in this House are continually prating about the success of private enterprise. If they were to make an assessment of the number of small people who go into business every year and fail, thereby losing their life&#39;s savings, they would be staggered at the result. Such people have no means of obtaining assistance, financial or otherwise. They take risks in entering business and fail. They have faith in their own capacity and they give of their best; but because of the unplanned economy which is part of our system of society, they are forced out of business. They do not go insolvent or bankrupt, but they lose their life&#39;s savings, and they generally lose the savings of some of their friends who have advanced money to them without security. </para>
          <para>No assessment of such people is ever made by Ministers, and yet they continually prate about the failure of socialism and so forth. </para>

              <para>- No, certainly not. I believe that at present I am making a very pertinent point in this debate. There are not only thousands of individuals who have the experience of having to relinquish their enterprises every year and go right to the wall; there are also thousands of small concerns which, over long periods of years, operate with no margin of profit at ali and their net income in many cases is substantially less than that of basic-wage earners. They live in the expectation that some day the fairies will be good to them and they will become financially successful. Great companies, such as the company concerned in this measure, which I believe is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, have plenty of assets and can raise capital on the security of those assets. In such circumstances a company could sell, for example, cellulose acetate flakein Australia at a loss for perhaps ten years, and even then ultimately make a success of its business. However, because of their political power, because they employ great numbers of men, because their product is in demand and is important for the defence purposes of this country, and because they are extremely articulate, they get financial assistance. Their circumstances are completely different from those of the small individuals and concerns that I previously mentioned. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I was doing that, but the people about whom I have been speaking - the small traders - never have an opportunity of going before the Tariff Board, because provision has not been made for them to do so. A man running a small furniture factory, for example, and employing himself and two or three other men, might go to the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> and say, &#34; Look here, my boy, I am having a tough run. I would like you, as a Minister, to help me &#34;. Then the Minister would most certainly say to him, &#34; I am very sorry for you, but there is no chance of my being able to put your case to the Tariff Board because your industry is so insignificant. I, as a Minister, deal only with concerns that employ thousands of workers, have millions of pounds of capital and are likely to become national assets &#34;. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>No consideration is given to the fact that those thousands of people need help and consideration by the Government. I say that too little consideration has been given to them in the past by any government, and no consideration at all has been given to them by the present Government. In those circumstances, my warning is issued for the reason that I think that not only the Tariff Board but also the Government should take notice of this particular phase of our economic life. Before the Government refers these matters to the Tariff Board, it might make inquiries on its own account to ascertain whether some of these big concerns can stand on their own feet a little longer without approaching the national Treasury to take a dip out of the revenue provided by the smaller people in the community. </para>
          <para>I want to be generous even to those who desire to be facetious about this matter. If honorable members are anxious to go home to bed, I say to them that it is regrettable that in regard to tariff problems sufficient time for debate is never allowed to the honorable members in this House. </para>
