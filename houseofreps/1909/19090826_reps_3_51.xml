            <para>.- Apparently, the desire of the mover of the motion is, not to abolish monopolies, but to place them under the control of the Federal Parliament, giving their ownership to- the Commonwealth. In my opinion, State-owned and controlled monopolies would be worse for the public than privatelyowned and controlled monopolies. The latter are almost invariably wellmanaged, being the creation of men of brains and ability. If it were otherwise, they would soon fail, for want of support and because of the competition of better managed concerns. State-owned monopolies, on the other hand, can be kept going at the expense of ihe public, however inefficient the service which they may provide. If the time is to come when the Commonwealth will own and control huge industrial concerns, I say, &#34; God help the people of Australia.&#34; </para>

              <para>- That is what I claim, though not in the sense in which the honorable member uses the words. Private persons can manage their affairs better than Parliament can manage them, and with &#34;greater advantage to the public. The community will, regret it, if ever the ownership and control of monopolies is given to the Commonwealth. In support of this assertion, let me mention my own experiences in Western Australia. Some years ago we had in that State  numerous timber companies, such as the Canning; the Gill-McDonald; the Jarradale; Millar&#39;s Jarrah Karri Company; the Imperial Jarrah Company; the Jarrah Wood Saw Mill Company; the M. C. Davis Karridale Company, and the J. C. Ports Collie Company, which were all competing with each other, and not one of them making substantial progress. Until the so-called timber combine was created, continuous employment was not available in the industry ; but, as the result of its formation, these companies have all been conducted on similar lines by Millar&#39;s Jarrah Karri Company, and the men have received better treatment than was possible before. Instead of being a curse, the co-called monopoly has been beneficial to the very members of the community who are supposed to be represented by the Opposition. The fact that few dividends, if any, have been paid, proves that the men* have been securing most of the returns from the enterprise. Yet it is one of the alleged wicked monopolies to which objection is taken. Like, many others, it is, as a matter of fact, really in the interests of the men. </para>

It is difficult to understand how an honorable member of his training and intelligence could expect the House to believe the assertions that he made. They were absolutely ridiculous. One statement made by him was that, as the result of the Beef Trust in Western Australia, certain butchers there had been refused a supply of meat. I interjected at the time that in Western Australia beef was as cheap as in any other part of the Commonwealth. The honorable member replied that if meat were cheap in Western Australia, it was shameful that it should be so dear in Victoria and New South Wales. I do not hesitate to say that, at the very time he made that statement,- meat in -Victoria and New South Wales was cheaper than it had. been for five or six years. I have seen, this morning, mutton exposed for sale in butchers&#39; shops at id. and 2d. per lb., and legs offered for sale at 3d. per lb. As a matter of fact, mutton can be obtained from the cool stores to-day for less than the cost of storing it. When the honorable member declared that meat was dear in Aus tralia, sheep were being sold in the Flemington yards for the price of their skins, and their carcases to-day can be bought for id. per lb. at the cool stores. Since no importance can be attached to the honorable member&#39;s statement as to the price of meat in this State, I invite honorable members to place no greater value on his general statement that monopolies are a curse. </para>

              <para>- I have before me a report of the speech made by the honorable member. On the day on which he said that meat was dear in Victoria and New South Wales, I and another honorable member went out to Prahran in order to see for ourselves the prices at which it was being offered there, and we found that it was cheaper than anywhere else in the world. One honorable member interjected while I was speaking, &#39; &#39; What about the Metropolitan Gas Company, Melbourne?&#34; I should like to know what honorable members have to say about it. Such enterprises are often controlled by municipal councils the members of which in many cases have proved themselves to be shrewd business men. These men are prepared to devote much of their time to the municipal works, and can supervise such concerns much better than a State monopoly could be controlled. It is for that reason that they are so successful. Would any one object to a municipality owning gas-works? Even if a profit be made by a municipality from such an undertaking it is for the benefit of the ratepayers, and it is preferable to allow a monopoly to secure a good profit provided that it sells its products at a reasonable rate than &#34;for  the people to have to pay high prices as the result of bad State management. Indifferent management often leads to high prices, and a well-managed monopoly which treats the consumer fairly is certainly not injurious. I propose to substantiate my statements in regard to monopolies by making a few quotations. On the title page of a book written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Flinders Petrie, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., and F.B.A., the statement appears : &#34; Fools only learn by their own experience ; wise men learn by, the experience of others.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Petrie</inline> points out that we may see in France how centralized management by the State accompanies a lack of private enterprise. That surely is clear enough; and the writer, referring to the railways of France, says - </para>

            <para>The enormous monopolies of railways in England are, on the whole, far more beneficial to the public than the State railways of other countries. The evils of corporate monopoly, checked by law and supervision of the Board of Trade, are less than the evil of stagnation by official atrophy. In the Republic of France the principal line runs its best trains slower than, and at three times the cost of, the best trains on great English lines. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This shows unmistakably that private monopolies are often less harmful than State monopolies. If a man spends the best part of his life as an employe in a State monopoly, and he happens to offend some official of the State, he has no other chance of obtaining employment, whereas, in the case of private firms, no questions are asked, and he can get employment elsewhere. </para>

              <para>- There may be &#34;black lists&#34; in Queensland, but I do not know of any in Western Australia. Such a workman as I have indicated may find himself dismissed at an age when it is very hard to find employment in another sphere of life. I contend that it is the splendid system of private enterprise, with its individual and interested supervision, that has, in many cases, created the so-called monopolies to which objection is now raised. We never hear of any proposal to take over a monopoly that does not pay, though the shareholders may have lost heavily in the venture. Perhaps one in twenty of the investors &#34;come out on top&#34;; but, in any case, the workmen are paid even if the money has to come out of the pockets of those who are losing their capital. If the motion be carried and a successful monopoly is taken over by the State, that monopoly will undoubtedly cease to pay. I would rather, live in a country where there is successful private business than where the people, as a whole, are trying to do something that.they have not the ability to do. I prefer a country where there are good healthy business concerns, managed by the brains of individuals of the community, because there we find the workmen treated well and always sure of their wages, whether the enterprises are monopolies or otherwise. </para>

              <para>- The Post and Telegraph Department is, perhaps, the biggest of State monopolies, and, in order to see how it is managed, we have only to read the report which was presented to us last session. That report is supposed to be a sort of balance-sheet showing the cost of each Post Office of each State, and, though it was presumably for our guidance, if the object had been to completely &#34; fog &#34; us, it could not have been better prepared. Such a report would not have been accepted by. the board of directors of any private company. Just imagine a balance-sheet of the kind being made out for each State ! This again is an illustration of how- the State would conduct the monopolies which were mentioned by the mover of this motion. We never hear of a private monopoly appointing a Commission to inquire into its affairs ; but, in the case of the only monopoly we have, there is a Royal Commission which only harasses the employes, and, in the end, will possibly cause dissension and trouble to the officers who are endeavouring to conduct the business in the light of their past experience. In my opinion this Commission can do no good, and will certainly do harm. </para>

              <para>- Before we consider the taking over of other monopolies we should try to conduct the one we have in a perfect manner. As an instance of the inefficient management of the Post and Telegraph Department, I may point out that even the telegraph forms are different in the various States, and that the rules for filling in the forms are not all the same. If honorable members could come to the House with complaints of private monopolies, similar to those which we hear about our own monopoly, more consideration  might be given to the proposition now before us, but the fact that the only monopoly which, we have is not run to the satisfaction of the country does not seem to carry any weight with those honorable members who are now in Opposition. What they really want is to take over the business of the country and run it themselves. The Opposition, being a monopoly itself, and wishing to extend its operations, desires to monopolize not only the Government, but the business of Australia. That is shown by the motion now before the House. If we were to place all these business propositions under State management, we should be placing all the employes in the different industries directly under State officialism, and under the laws of unionism. The small tradesmen would then be simply wiped out, and they represent, in a sense, the backbone of the country. If such a thing were brought about, where should we get people from for our townships?&#39; They would be all put in Government institutions, and the natural corollary would be that large institutions would be needed in which to keep them and feed them. This sort of thing is not new. Unionism tried this game centuries ago and failed, and will fail again.

          <para class="block">A healthy business concern, directed by men of capacity and experience, is something to be admired. By it there is transmitted to the succeeding generation a system of administration, management, and commercial method, of which the community should feel proud, because it is these things that tend to success, and unsuccessful enterprise is all too common. The methods of unionism do not make for success. Yet they are advocated by the members of the Labour party, who, by trying to apply them universally, are injuring the industries of this great country. As I said on another occasion, unionism would be a good thing if it made for competence. But injury must be done to both private and State-owned concerns if the same treatment and wages are demanded for the incompetent as are earned by the competent. Australia would suffer a crushing blow if the Commonwealth were empowered to take over and controlher successful industries. </para>
          <para>Mr.CHANTER (Riverina)  &#91;3.18&#93;.-  The House has just been treated to a most extraordinary address by the honorable member for Fremantle, who has posed as the champion of monopolies. During his speech he was careful to refrain from replying to interjections, although I and others very pertinently asked him, when he said that State-owned concerns cannot be as successfully managed as private concerns, &#34; What about the railways?&#34; He read to us the statements of a Professor Petrie. Who that gentleman is I do not know. Whoeverhe may be, we should not be wise in accepting his advice in opposition to our experience. The honorable member for Fremantle has used the motion as a vehicle for an attack upon the Labour party and unionism, though what it is intended to provide for is the nationalization of injurious monopolies, should that be necessary. No sane man would imagine that Parliament would dream of interfering with a business concern which was being properly conducted, and by which the public was being well served. Where monopolies are injurious to the community, Parliament should have the right to interfere, in the interests of the public. </para>

              <para>- That is not the point. The contention raised by the honorable member for Fremantle is that privately controlled enterprises are more advantageous to the public than are those conducted by the State. The tram service of Sydney is owned by the people, and one may travel upon it anywhere within the city for a penny. So great are the advantages of that service to the people of Sydney, that I venture to say that it carries three times as many passengers as does the Melbourne Tramway Company. </para>

In every State there are Government monopolies, in the shape of railways, owned and controlled by the States in the interests of the people. In some partsof the Commonwealth there are also privately-controlled railway lines which offer us an object lesson in this regard. There is, for instance, a privately-owned railway line running from Moama, oh the Victorian border, some 50 miles inland to Deniliquin, which has been in existence for over thirty years; and a comparison will show that the fares and rates charged by the company are 50 per cent. higher than those charged for a like mileage on any of the State-owned railways. Then there is the Silverton tramway, which runs from the South Australian border into New South Wales. It is, as I have said, in reality a railway line, and the freights charged in connexion with it are higher than are those charged on the State-owned railways. There is also a privately-owned railway line in Western Australia, and the honorable member for Fremantle must admit that the service it provides is neither as comfortable nor as cheap as that supplied by the State. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member cannot refute my statements. The same state of affairs prevails in connexion with the privately-owned railways of Tasmania. The reason for this difference in fares and freights is that in the case of the State the railways are only expected to pay, working expenses, interest on capital, and the necessary contribution to a sinking fund, and nothing more has to be added to the charges, whereas aprivately-owned railway has to provide dividends for shareholders. </para>

              <para>- That is an irrelevant interjection. We were told by the honorable member for Fremantle that the people were better served by privately-controlled enterprises than by State-owned undertakings. In answer to the honorable member, I am pointing out that in a time of great emergency the State-owned railways of New South Wales proved to be in the interesfs of the people, and did much to save the stock and trade and commerce of the State. Not only was fodder carried over them for practically nothing, but starving stock were carried free to districts where food supplies were available. </para>

I anc putting certain broad facts before the House as illustrating the advantages derived from the State control of our railways. Whilst the State services were helping stock-owners and others who suffered by reason of the drought, the privatelyowned railways in the State would not reduce their freights on stock or fodder. </para>

              <para>- The directors had reserve funds at their disposal, and might well have said : &#34;If, as the result of our failure to reduce freights, thousands of stock die, our returns later on will be materially reduced. In the circumstances, therefore, it will be well for us to reduce our freights, even if we have to entrench upon our reserve funds, because later on the bread thus cast upon the waters will return to us.&#34; As long as the Government railways pay, the State is satisfied; but privately-owned railways have not only to provide a service, but to earn good dividends. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member ought to know better than that. He knows that I did my best to meet the special conditions that had arisen, but that the Government had to keep in mind the requirements of the Constitution. &#39; A comparison of the State-owned railways of Australia with those controlled by private companies is altogether in favour of the Government monopoly. The honorable mem ber for Fremantle referred to the privatelyowned railways in England and France, but forgot to point out that there is no monopoly in Great Britain. There a number of private companies are competing with each other, and that competition acts as a check against high freights. It is only when a monopoly is created - when all those engaged in a certain industry are brought under one central control - that danger arises. </para>

              <para>- If I found that there was in Australia an industry so controlled by a combine as to destroy competition, and unduly to inflate prices, I should not have the slightest hesitation in giving my vote for State control in the interests of a better service, because that is what I call an injurious monopoly. I have no objection to two, three, or more traders combining in the interests of their trade, so long as, in the absence of competition, they do not endeavour to bleed the public. </para>

          <para class="block">Telegraph Department as an injurious monopoly. The honorable member girded at the members of the Postal Commission, and took it for granted that the fact that such a body was in existence proved that State control had been a failure, and that the best thing would &#39;be to allow private capitalists to provide the services. Before Federation, it cost 3s. and 4s. to send a telegram from New South Wales to Western Australia, and in Sydney the charge was 6d. within a certain radius, and is. beyond. Similar conditions prevailed in Victoria ; but now it is possible to send a telegram anywhere within the Commonwealth for is. The former high charges were caused by the fact that each State through which the message was conveyed required payment; and the change since Federation has undoubtedly been to the benefit of the people. There could be no greater proof that under proper control by the State many advantages are gained by the community. I am sure that the PostmasterGeneral and the late PostmasterGeneral will agree with&#39; me that if the telephone system had been under private control, we should not have had one-tenth of the mileage that now exists in the Cornman wealth. </para>

              <para>- That is another fact which should carry a great deal of weight. Privately-owned enterprises are moneymaking from their initiation, and the moment they fail to return profits they die. In the case of the State, however, it is not the desire to observe strictly commercial lines ; the work is regarded as national and in the interests of the people; and, so long as it pays, and provides for the redemption of loan moneys, and so forth, nothing further is demanded. All country members know how difficult it is to get the telephone service extended; but, at the same time, numbers of connexions are being made which have no prospect of paying interest for years to come. It is recognised, however, that the telephone system is a national service for the purpose of developing the country, and it could not possibly be adequately provided by a combination of capital. In the Old Country the post and telegraph services were originally in the hands of private individuals, but even there the trouble, inconvenience, and cost were so excessive that it was found necessary to resort to&#39; nationalization. </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly. What reasonable man can object to the motion, which simply asks the people of Australia to give this Parliament certain powers? We know that if a power be given it need not be exercised, unless the evil is present; but the mere fact that there is such a power prevents the injury which it is the object of this motion to prevent. We may look, on control by the States, as compared with Federal control, as a kind of private enterprise, and the honorable member for Wilmot .and others who are interested in the question of the potato blight have seen how easy it is for the States to utilize their laws to prevent the importation of products under a system of inspection. If there were one central control, the introduction of produce or stock would be permitted to any part of Australia under certain conditions - that is, not a whole State, but only certain districts, would be quarantined as the necessity arose. My experience teaches me that every service that the Commonwealth has undertaken has been vastly to the benefit of the community, as compared with the results under the control of the States, and vastly more than could possibly be hoped for under private enterprise. The honorable member for Fremantle denies that there is any combination in the meat trade, and asserts that mutton can be bought for id. and 2d. per pound. 1 should like the honorable member to tell us where meat can be purchased at that price, because I know that, for months past, in Victoria and New South Wales, the butchers have been charging up to lod. and is. per pound for very ordinary meat. I do not assert that the  stock-owners  have reaped the benefit of the high prices, and I do not deny that possibly sheep or cattle may have recently been sold in the yards at lower prices than previously ; but I do know that the housewife, who has to foot the butcher&#39;s bill, is not getting her supplies at anything like the prices quoted by the honorable member. I do not know whether there is a combination amongst those engaged in the meat supply business, but, if there is, and it has the effect of placing a burden on the people, it would be better to have State intervention than to allow the people to be crushed. If the  power asked for were given to this Parliament, I should never be found attempting such, silly action as that suggested by the honorable member for Fremantle, when be said that, under nationalization, every little shop would be taken over by the State. When we find the Government failing to get sufficient evidence to make our industrial laws effective in the matter of monopolies which are known to exist, it is quite time that this Parliament had more power. In the one or two test cases which have been tried by the Courts, we have been told that our legislation is not constitutional. We can make it constitutional only by asking the people to give us the necessary power. &#39;If the people, who are the controllers of their own destinies, say that they want that done, it -ought to be done. If they do give the Federal Parliament that power, it will be the duty of the Parliament, whenever an injurious monopoly is found, to take it over and control it for the benefit of the people and the commerce of Australia. </para>

              <para>- It may be possible at any given moment to decide that a. person or corporation is the only one dealing in a certain article within the confines of Australia; but there is nothing in the constitution of the particular corporation referred to which will enable it absolutely to control the market in Australia and exclude from it any competitor who chooses to enter the lists. Only a short time ago, there was a large competing firm of sugarrefiners in Melbourne which was also putting up works in Sydney. I believe it has since been bought out by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, but still that incident shows the possibility of competition. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friends are now trying to show that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which .has been referred to as an octopus, is really a philanthropic institution, which is prepared to buy out firms that it could choke out ! The present target of honorable members opposite is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. A year or two ago, it used to be the Tobacco Monopoly, which was held up to universal execration. We do not hear so much of that now since my honorable friends have discovered that it is really a beneficent institution. In those days, when, like the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> they thought the Tobacco Trust was an obnoxious institution, they instituted a Commission to inquire into its operations. That body, whose report was signed by Labour members, decided that the Tobacco Monopoly was not a complete, but a &#34; partial monopoly.&#34; Are we to understand from the motion now before the House that honorable members opposite wish to take power to nationalize &#34; partial monopolies,&#34; for it is made clear by the report of their own Commission that we cannot find a complete monopoly in Australia ? If they propose to take power to nationalize partial monopolies, they will be able to nationalize any of the successful business institutions that are the very proper subjects for greed and envy. I take it that my honorable friends are honest men. They are certainly honest in all their private dealings, and I presume they are going to be honest in their public enterprises. Being honorable men, therefore, I presume that they are going to pay for whatever industries they nationalize. Am I right in that assumption of their honesty ? </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member intends to realize on the assets, he will put them again into private circulation; but surely he wants to nationalize those industries, not to provide billets for friends, but in order to run them for the national benefit? If so, he must hold those assets, and, although they are realizable, he must raise money to purchase them, and that will mean in the first year the raising of between twenty and thirty million pounds for a start. Now, my honest and honorable friends opposite have recently declared themselves before the people of Australia as being prepared to die in the last ditch rather than borrow a cent on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is only fair, therefore, that we should analyse their platform pledges. </para>

There is no borrowing by the Commonwealth at present, and they propose to initiate borrowing, and in doing so they say they are honouring their pledge &#34; to restrict public borrowing.&#34; My honorable friends&#39; methods are rather casuistical. They have a singular contempt for the intelligence of the Australian electors if they think that that sort of thing will go. down. They suggest that there is an excuse for borrowing to nationalize - industries, and their platform says that there must be restriction of public borrowing. They will therefore see that the sooner they are quite honest and open with the public the better for themselves as well as for the representative character of a House of this kind. </para>

              <para>- I understand that there are certain considerations which prevent my honorable friends from supporting anything of an Imperial nature like the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> gift, and compel them to subscribe more particularly to subjects of a &#34;national&#34; brand, in the sense of the &#34;nationalist&#34; brand that is disturbing the public peace in another part of the world. My honorable friends opposite, with all their manifest qualities and virtues, apparently do not possess the business instincts which would enable them to run great enterprises like the various large combines and trading combinations that have been referred to. The only time I ever heard them really anxious and excited about the value of private enterprise was when a suggestion was put before the House some time ago to nationalize in an indirect way the business of a union secretary. The honorable member for North Sydney proposed on that occasion that, as the cost for arbitration to the employ^ through his union, varied from <inline font-style="italic">66. to</inline> is. 6d. per week, while the actual cost of the Arbitration Court to the community generally, was something like a farthing or a half-penny a week, we might do a beneficent action to the poor worker by starting a bureau before which any man whose wage receipts were stamped every week would have the right to appear and have his grievance heard. When we proposed thus &#39; indirectly to nationalize the monopoly of the union secretary, honorable members opposite pointed out, as we might very easily point out now, that no Government Department could ever hope to carry out an agency that was so intricate, that had such ramifications, and that required such a high order of intelligence and business capacity as that of a union secretary ! I listened to my honorable friends opposite with great respect upon that occasion, and I hope they will hold the same views now that somebody else&#39;s job is proposed to be nationalized. As I was saying, they are hardly business men. 1 hold in my hand a proposition, signed by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, who was one of the Ministers in the late Labour Administration, on a very excellent subject. With alarge portion of the report I am completely in accord ;but I wish to draw attention to the particular part of it which is Socialistic, in order to show what business men we have among my honorable and distinguished friends opposite. The proposition was for the acquisition by the Commonwealth of horses for military purposes. The Commonwealth was to buy horses, according to the honorable member&#39;s proposal, and let them out from week to week to people who cared to use them, at 7s. 6d. per week each. From the point of view of the horses, I do not think that proposition will meet with much indorsement. In his report the honorable member for Hindmarsh says : &#34; There will beavailable for hire 1,011 horses, whose total earnings, at 7s. 6d. per week, would be&#163;19,000.&#34; </para>

Honorable members opposite may well be allowed to win whatever applause they may by bringing forward suggestions of this kind, where such clap-trap will go down without contradiction, and where approbation may be secured from those who have not the time or ability to properly study these questions for themselves. </para>

            <para>.- The speeches of the honorable members for Fremantle and Wentworth contain large admissions of the strength of the case of the honorable member for Werriwa. If nothing more can be said against the motion than they have said, the House must carry it by an enormous majority. Many of the remarks of the honorable member for Fremantle seemed to have no connexion with the subject. Had he studied the history of the Roman Empire more closely, he would know that, in its most brilliant period, its business affairs were conducted by unions, which were held responsible for the laches of their members. Still, these facts are only remotely connected with modern social conditions, and have no bearing on the proposal for the nationalization of monopolies. The shareholders and directors of our combines, trusts, and monopolies, will read with great amusement the statements of their champions. They will laugh when they hear that it has been said that their great aim is to increase employment and to better the conditions of labour, and will think the members of the House very silly persons for listening to such remarks. Every one knows that the chief object of combination is the increasing of profits by the perfection of organization. When the whisky mills of the United States fell into the hands of a combination, only twelve of the forty-nine were kept open, the industry being centralized where the largest returns could be obtained, the number of its employes being consequently lessened. We, who favour, the nationalization of monopolies, recognise that their success is due to superior organization, but if they were State-owned, they would be managed by brains similar to those which now manage them, which would be a guarantee of future success. The honorable member for Wentworth spoke flippantly, because be knows that the facts are against him. He suggested that we, on this side of the House, should personally supervise and control all State-owned industries, and he asked what business knowledge we have. Honorable members opposite associate business enterprise wholly with profit-making. </para>

Co-operative concerns in Belgium and England have a turnover of ^125,000.000 per annum, and a profit of over ^10,000,000. They were commenced with very little capital, and I claim that it would not be necessary foi the Commonwealth to borrow largely to secure the ownership of such monopolies as it might wish to acquire. There is not yet a majority in favour of putting  under  Commonwealth control such monopolies as may be deemed injurious to the public, but when there is, we, on this side, will be prepared to show how it can best be done. The honorable member for Wentworth  condemned  the proposal on the strength of some regulations apparently drawn up bytwo military officers. The honorable member for Fremantle, having heard the honorable member for Werriwa mention the word &#34;beef&#34; in his speech, rushed round Melbourne to ascertain its local price, and then told us exactly what it can be bought for. He failed to understand that the honorable member foi Werriwa was referring; to the Beef Trust of the United States.. That Trust is getting a grip of Australia,, and 1 can say from absolute knowledge that, but for the existence of the socialistic abattoirs of the municipalities of Melbourne and Richmond, the meat supplies of the metropolis would be controlled by a combination. That is now prevented by the fact that butchers can get animals killed at the public abattoirs. The honorable member for Wentworth admitted that trustshave not been able to grow up quickly in Australia because the States own most of the means of transit. Where State-owned lines can be compared with privately-owned lines, the comparison, from the point of view of the public interest, is always in their favour. For instance, the second class fare from Deniliquin to Echuca, a privately-owned railway is 9s., while for the same distance - 45 miles - on the Victorian  railways a passenger is charged only 4s. 4d. In Tasmania, &#39; the passenger rate &#39; on the State-owned lines is 7s. 2d., as against 22s. on a private line. A similar comparison could be made in Queensland, and like remarks apply to goods rates. Furthermore, the rates on the State-owned lines are low, notwithstanding the almost entire absence of competition. If State management is a good thing in connexion with railway control, why should it not be a good thing in other matters, and especially in regard to sea transit? At present, the public is being overcharged by a ring of ship-owners. </para>

              <para>-  Water carriage is always cheaper than land carriage, though on the Australian coast it is not as cheap as it should be. If the people of the States owned the steam-ships as they ought to do, the public would be advantaged. When interrupted, I was about to mention that the carriage of stock and fodder /over our railways is of the utmost importance to stock-owners, and the people generally of New South Wales and other parts of the Commonwealth. During the last great drought, we lost 50,000,000 stock, representing a value of &#163;25,000,000, to say nothing of the. loss of their progeny and the annual value of the wool, of which we were thus deprived, tin times of drought, the lives of thousands of stock are saved by their removal from one district to another, and the State-owned railways materially assist in that work by a substantial reduction in freights. Then again, in the Cobar district, which is within my electorate, during the drought people were supplied with water carried over the railways for a distance of 1 20 miles. That water was conveyed almost free of charge, in order that the people might be kept there. Would such a thing have been done by a private railway company? I think not. Private enterprises take advantage of the difficulties of the people, and when they are cornered, make them pay for it. If they did not do so, they would not know how to manage their business. The honorable member for Wentworth says that the Labour party are not business men ; and we are glad to say that in that sense we are not. We desire to introduce an entirely new system of conducting business enterprise, and Labour has shown, in the management of friendly societies and great co-operative enterprises, that it is far more successful in business than is the capitalist. Capitalists can manage to pull along when they talk in millions, but their enterprises are often absolute failures. The whole system of private enterprise is wrong. I recognise that isolated cases are not to be cited as substantial evidence one way or the other, but I would remind the honorable member for Fremantle that in dealing with this question he overlooked certain illustrations which might well have been drawn from the experiences of his own State. He did not mention that the people on the goldfields there had to pay 25s. per 100 gallons for their water until the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was the leader, carried out the great Coolgardie water supply scheme. With the completion of that scheme, the price of water on the gold-fields was at once materially reduced. </para>

I learn from tea blenders that by means of judicious blending they can secure is. 6d. per lb. for a certain tea, just as easily as they could obtain is. pei lb. for it.

              <para>- That interjection is neither relevant nor personal. The removal of the duty on hats would not affect me in the least degree. A duty on kerosene might prove burdensome, but it is certainly open to discussion. As the honorable member for Melbourne has suggested there are in the Tariff a large number of revenue-produc- ing items, which ought not to be revenue - producing. Take, for instance, the duty on cotton goods. I have yet to learn that one person has benefited by the reduction of the duty on that line to 5 per cent. </para>

              <para>- They dare do anything that becomes a man, or else I shall not support them. During the last fifty years there have been no less than five important revisions of the Tariff in America. In 1861. as the result of the first Tariff, only about &#163;8,000,000 was derived from Customs duties. In 1866, however, a year after the close of the Civil War, the revenue from that source amounted to no less than &#163;35,000,000. I am well aware that special revenue duties were imposed for war purposes, but it was ascertained that man)&#39;- of those duties were legitimate, that they imposed no &#39;burden on any section of the community, that they were easily collected, and that while they were not protective in their incidence, they did no injury to the consumer. The same argument will apply to items to which I have referred. There are on the free list many items which might well be made revenue-producing, without doing injury to any one. </para>

              <para>- I shall show that I am ns&#34; much in favour of Protection as any honorable member on the other side. I do not think that my position as a Protectionist can be challenged ; and what I am suggesting is quite compatible with absolute Protection. When the Victorian Tariff was the most scientific and the most highly protective, it produced more revenue <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> than it did under other conditions; and revenue-raising duties are quite in consonance with even prohibitive duties. Then followed in the United States the Tariff Commission Law of 1883. American experience appears to have been very like Federal experience. There was a Tariff Commission which visited &#34;a~ great number of the States, and called some thousands of witnesses ; and in the main it proposed considerable reductions. The Government; however, completely ignored the report&#34; and recommendations of the Commission, and put on all-round duties something like 20 per cent, higher than was suggested. This was done with the assistance of many Democratic votes. Then followed the McKinley Tariff of 1890, the Wilson Tariff of 1894, the Dingley Tariff of 1897, and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff of this year. The last mentioned is one of the most farreaching, powerful, and scientific Acts that, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> New York correspondent, has ever been considered by the American Legislature. </para>

              <para>- I do not think the honorable member would say &#34; Hear, hear!&#34; if that Act applied to Australia. However, the Act does not discriminate against countries which are dependencies or part of an Empire ; and so long as we make our preferential duties apply only to Great Britain, the extra duties will not be imposed on Australian products. But if, in our preference, we go beyond Canada, New Zealand, or the Empire generally, we shall be subject to. the discrimination. The most drastic provision in the new law, and one of great interest to Australia, is that relating to invoices, methods of valuation, and the increased powers of the Board of General Appraisers. The amendments on these points occupy about fifty pages of the Act ; and the duty of the nine appraisers will be to constitute themselves a Court of Appeal in regard to disputes. From their decision there will be no further appeal. </para>

              <para>- The  President  is empowered to appoint them immediately on the passing of the Act. Another interesting innovation is what is called a new method of direct taxation in the form of a graduated income tax on all the profits of industries over &#163;1,000. In other words, the large monopolists and manufacturers of America will be called upon to pay a very considerable tax on the whole of their profits over that amount. This is said to be a most remarkable measure for using the Customs revenue machinery, for the purpose of direct taxation. The amount to bc raised is, of course, largely conjecture ; but it is said will run into millions of pounds per year, and that no one will be injured; while the revenue of the United States will be largely benefited. This is a matter thai is worthy of very serious consideration. U we could get for the public, by means of taxation, a part of the handsome profits that accrue in some lines of manufacture, it would be one means of raising revenue for defence or old-age pensions that should commend itself, at any rate, to the earnest thought of the Government. </para>

              <para>- No; only to the profits of manufacturers. This provision was inserted in the Tariff Act, but at the request of the  President  it was withdrawn,, and embodied in a separate measure. Another fact that experience evidences is that in the United States the people are beginning to realize what national protection means. We in Australia have not realized its meaning yet. The Tariff debates in this House - the haphazard decisions that were arrived at, and the State jealousies that crept in - indicate clearly that we have not the faintest idea of what national protection is. </para>

              <para>- Or nationality. This idea has been put very excellently by General Wm. F. Draper,  president  of the largest textile machine manufacturing establishment in America. General Draper is said to employ some 7,000 high-class mechanics, and to be one of the best employers in the iron industry of the United States. This gentleman has conceived an idea of national protection, which we have not anything like attained as yet. When we were discussing the timber duties, for instance, a large number of votes were given against, simply because the timber was grown in far-off Queensland, or because the duties hit some of the Melbourne manufacturers who refused to use Australian timber. The absence of a national spirit or national idea was evidenced in quite a number of ways, of which this is just an illustration. General Draper, speaking on the question to his constituents, said - </para>

            <para>Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is evident that if Protection is to stand as a principle, it must be fairly and impartially applied. If Massachusetts asks Protection for her products consumed by other States, it is no more than fair that she should agree to Protection on the products of other States that she consumes. If woollens made in Massachusetts demand Protection the wool of Ohio and the far West is also entitled to it, and if the machines which manufacture it are protected I see no reason why the iron of Pennsylvania and Alabama which we consume should not be also - if it needs Protection to insure the profitable continuance of the business of making iron and the payment of American wages in that industry. More than this, the senators and representatives from other States will never agree that the products of Massachusetts shall be protected and theirs open to free foreign competition. They would rather have free-trade all round, and they would be perfectly right in taking this position. </para>

          <para class="block">I am quite convinced that a great many of the duties in our own Tariff were opposed from want of knowledge. Had we had expert opinion on the nature and capabilities of the various Australian woods, duties would have been imposed in many instances where we failed to secure protection. For instance, we were applied to time and again to impose a duty on spokes and rims used in the manufacture of vehicles; but it was urged by local manufacturers that, if that industry were protected - an industry which employed hundreds of men, and under the old Victorian Tariff enjoyed a fair duty - the carriage trade would be killed. One side affirmed and the other denied ; and, in the absence of expert evidence or practical demonstration, the duties were removed, with the result that the works are now absolutelyclosed. I am informed on the best authority that the very wood from which these spokes and rims were manufactured in Australia is. being cultivated in California. In nearly all the American magazines there ^ are advertisements offering land, said to * be specially adapted for the growing of this particular . kind of wood, and a large number of vehicles, exported from the United States, are made of the wood that we disdained and refused to protect. </para>

              <para>- It is also an anomaly for the reason that, in particular instances, we imposed a duty on articles that are not being manufactured here, and we have not yet protected articles that are being manufactured here. That is so in quite a number of cases. This particular proposal was sprung on the House ; and neither Ministers nor members had any information in regard to it. The voting, was entirely haphazard, and the result is an anomaly and an unscientific Tariff. The same remark applies to dozens of cases which arose during the passage of the Tariff, when the want of knowledge on the part of every one of us was most lamentable. </para>

              <para>- The Tariff Commission demonstrated clearly the need for a body constituted as I propose. What should we have done without the Tariff Commission? We did not altogether follow their proposals, but they certainly gave us an amount of information and guiding without which we should have been in a sorry plight. My contention is that the principle underlying the investigations and reports of the Tariff Commission should be permanent - that we should have somebody continuously at work ascertaining the benefits of the Tariff, anomalies in the Tariff, and the possibilities of establishing and encourag ing new industries. Take the vexed question of the relationship of rawmaterial to the manufactured article, which brings me to the anomaly mentioned by the honorable member for Melbourne. There hasbeen a great agitation in reference to the duties which we put upon piece goods. Our decisions were of a drag-net character. We put duties not only upon woollen piece goods used by men, and manufactured in our own factories, but on dress piece goodsthat we thought came into competition with woollen piece goods. That is said to behaving, and I believe is having, a very detrimental effect upon a number of our manufacturers. </para>

              <para>- At a deputation which waited upon the Minister of Customs recently, it was urged that the effect of the duty has been really, as the honorable member for Melbourne says, to prevent the better class of piece goods being used by the average working woman, and not in any way to protect the Australian manufacturer. The woollen mills declare that if there can be secured to them the manufacture of tweeds - woollen piece goods wornby men - they will have a market that they will not be likely to overtake for a considerable time unless new factories arestarted, and I believe that they offer no opposition to women&#39;s piece goods being considerably reduced in duty, if not made free altogether. But the difficulty is in discriminating. Even the cotton piece goods are manufacturedin pattern, and style, and thickness, in such a way that it is extremely difficult to discriminate between them and the lower classes of woollen goods manufactured not only in Australia  but in other parts of the world. It is a matter for expert advice, decision, and vigilance, because there is no doubt that as the result of this anomaly a very great amount of woollen goods come into  Australia  designated as cotton goods. The Minister of Trade and Customs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Robert</inline> Best, said, in reply to the deputation that waited on him - </para>

            <para>I must confess I am very sorry to hear the rather gloomy tale told in connexion with this industry. Of course, the representations that are made are entitled to the most serious consideration. As to the statements regarding dumping, I know, from what you have said and from other inquiries I have made, that there is much room for complaint in this direction. I am sorry, indeed, if the provisions of our law at present are not sufficient to deal with the cases that have been made out. </para>

            <para>It will be my duty to further take into consideration this question of dumping, wilh the object, if possible, of granting some relief. Stress has been laid on the very low prices at which the goods are invoiced, but X would point out that the duties are not necessarily charged on the prices set out in the invoices, but on what would be the real value of the goods at the port of export. </para>

          <para>The mode of  arriving  at the value of goods in Australia under  our  Customs  Act  has proved inoperative and ineffective  in  America, where a very radical and farreaching change has just been made. These goods are exported, say, from Berlin,  at the&#39;  end of the season, when their value in  Berlin  is nothing like their real market value.  It  is on their value at the time  they  are exported that our Customs House  has  the right to base the duty. In America, as I say, a  radical  change has now been made, and a description of it is  given in  the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 20th  July, which  contains a special supplement devoted entirely  to  the new American Tariff and its incidence and effects. The new provision  in  the American Tariff Act is as follows :- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The actual market value or wholesale price, as defined by law, qf any imported merchandise which is consigned for sale in the United States, or which is sold for exportation to the United States, and which is not actually sold or freely offered for sale in usual wholesale quantities in the open market of the country of exportation to all purchasers, shall not in any case be appraised at less than the wholesale price at which such or similar imported merchandise is actually sold or freely offered for sale in usual wholesale quantities in the United States in the open market, due allowance by deduction being made for estimated duties thereon, cost of transportation, insurance, and other necessary expenses from the place of shipment to the place of delivery, and a commission not exceeding 6 per centum, if any tas been paid or contracted to be paid. </para>

            <para>The  President  is authorized to appoint a Board of nine general appraisers of merchandise, the salary of each to be $9,000 (&#163;1,800)  per annum, who shall possess all the powers of a Circuit Court of the United States. To these genera&#93; appraisers all cases of dissatisfaction with the amount and rates of duties levied by the appraisers and assistant appraisers at the various ports will be referred. This Board will exercise both judicial and inquisitorial functions. Appeal must be made by the importers to this Board within 15 days, or the original duties and charges will stand. </para>

          <para>The article goes on to show that the marked difference between the new and the old practice is that, instead of taking the article at its supposed value in the market from which it is exported, the value must be taken in the wholesale warehouse in the country in which it is being distributed. A large importing house, some three or four years ago, imported a big line of mantles from Berlin, that were invoiced at something like 9s. 9d. each. That was ascertained to be their selling value at the time they were exported from Berlin, but when they reached Australia they were soli! at no less than 25s. 6d. apiece. There were hundreds of dozens of them, so that a very handsome profit was realized by the importer. Under the Australian Act all that the Minister of Customs could do was to see that the duty was appraised on the value in Berlin at the time they were exported, which was 9s. 9d. each. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Hume was not personally informed in regard to one-twentieth of the proposals submitted in the last Tariff, and had to admit his want of knowledge times without number. That statement is not a reflection tion upon him. It would be impossible for any man to grasp the thousand and one issues involved in a Tariff, but the experience of Canada, America, and Germany, shows that careful investigation is needed. Dumping can be properly dealt with only on the lines I have indicated. I suggest the need of watching for possibilities for encouraging new industries. No doubt, the honorable member for Hume was as desirous as any other honorable member of protecting existing industries and of encouraging the development of new ones, but an industry at Warburton, in which thousands of pounds have been invested for the utilization of wood, which is now wasted, was unable to obtain encouragement or protection, because there were no means for laying its claims before Parliament, and party and personal interests triumphed. </para>

              <para>- The merits of the proposal are not to be judged by the opinions held regarding the present Administration. Honorable members must ask themselves this question : vis our present mode of dealing with Tariffs adequate or complete ? The best-informed Minister must be ignorant of the far-reaching character of many of the proposals contained in a Tariff, and we should try to profit by the experience of Canada, Germany, and America. Should this, or any other Government, refuse to comply with the will of the House, it could be dealt with. </para>

              <para>- lt might be well to refer important measures to a Select Committee of experts for analysis and report. The members of the Labour party are always talking about progress, but when anything out of the ordinary course is proposed, they object that no good will come of it. Parliamentary methods, like the methods of all human institutions, are susceptible of improvement. Although we occupied months in dealing with the last Tariff, anomalies have already appeared, and that despite the fact that a Royal Commission&#39;s investigations preceded its introduction. </para>

            <para>.- I should not have risen at this stage but for one or two observations made by members of the Opposition, and made, I think, without sufficient, if . any, consideration. They seemed to me to be based upon the assumption that no one could support this motion who was not in favour of protective duties. I have- no hesitation in saying that it is a motion of which every thoughtful Free Trader and Protectionist can well approve. I remarked jocularly in the course of the honorable member for Maribyrnong&#39; s speech that he was &#34; stealing my thunder.&#34; I have no objection to the theft. </para>

              <para>- I am sure that the honorable member is quite innocent of any such intention, &#39; and am glad that he has taken up this matter. I suggested more than once during the consideration of the Tariff that such a body as he proposes should be created, and I did so because of the example we had of the difficulty of having fiscal questions brought frequently before the Parliament upon insufficient consideration. We all remember that as the basis of the last Tariff struggle in this House a Commission was appointed, very fairly and, I think, well balanced. It comprised men eminently qualified to deal impartially with the questions submitted to it. They were equally balanced in their fiscal views, and it was hoped that, as a result of the Commission,  this House, which is supposed to legislate, would be saved the perusal of barrowsful of printed or written documents sent to them by interested parties, and containing statements which were, in many cases, not only biased, but untrue. I have always seen great difficulty in dealing with <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements made by manufacturers on the one side and by importers on the other, the manufacturer crying &#34;havoc&#34; as regards the importer, and the importer crying &#34;havoc&#34; as regards the manufacturer. When the Tariff Commission was being appointed I requested the then Prime Minister, the right honorable member for East Sydney, to take care that the innocent consumer was represented upon it. It seemed to be assumed that all that was necessary was to ascertain what the manufacturers of the States wanted, and, with a reasonable check upon their aspirations, to introduce a new Tariff without remembering&#39; that, after all, the consumer had to pay, and that it was our duty as representatives of the people to consider what effect any new Tarin5 might have upon them. That Commission was appointed. Its <inline font-style="italic">personnel,</inline> and the circumstances under which it was created, were in every way satisfactory ; but what was the result? The Commission spent months in investigating the circumstances surrounding the different industries with which we were going to deal ; yet we were inundated with all sorts of statements as to the merits of particular industries - an inundation from which we ought to have been saved. I placed almost the whole of those documents in the waste-paper basket, because I found that many were full of misrepresentations, and I hardly knew which to believe and which to distrust The honorable member who was then Minister of Trade and Customs, and who had the charge of the Tariff Bill in this House, instead of using the reports of the Commission for the purpose of throwing an impartial and judicial light upon the problems that we had to determine, in many, cases ignored its findings. In others he adopted the findings of only the Protectionist section of the Commission, but insisted, from time to time, in speaking of them as being those of &#34; the Commission.&#34; That was of little consequence, so far as we were concerned, because we knew what were the findings of the Protectionist wing of the Commission and what were those of the Commission as a whole. The recommendations of the whole Commission were very often a compromise between the two extremes ; and should have been used as aguide; but the Ministers&#39; statements, so far as they were published in the press, went forth to the public as if that Commission, consisting of Free Traders and Protectionists, had actually recommended the <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> proposals that he was putting before the House. I regret that many Protectionists in this House too willingly allowed1 themselves to be persuaded to adopt such proposals as if they were recommendations of the Commission, although only the findings of the Protectionist section of it. That was my reason for proposing that we should have a permanent body of unbiased men to watch the operations of the Tariff in the various aspects that have been dealt with by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, so that Parliament could be informed from time to time whether it was necessary to make alterations. </para>

              <para>- I do not propose anything of the kind. We all remember - and this is only one instance of what may occur unless this Commission is appointed - the case of the &#39;Panama hats. Some years ago the firm of Henty and Company, one of the most respectable ir&#62; this city, imported certain hats from the Island of Formosa. That importation was: held up by the Department of Trade and Customs, and the firm was subjected to the humiliation of having it forfeited and sold in the public market. This House has never been able to ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the statement of Messrs. Henty and Company that the Customs authorities had exercised an arbitrary and biased opinion in forfeiting those hats. without taking the trouble of ascertaining whether their statement was correct or not. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. An investigation was demanded, but could not be obtained. If such a body as is now proposed had been in existence all the facts would have been placed before us, and we should have known whether or not the Minister had merely persisted in his contention because, being wrong in the first place, he did not wish to undergo the humiliation of confessing his error when the truth came to light. Another reason why I think the proposed Board or Commission is necessary is that, as honorable members will have noticed, there is too much legislation, if I may so describe it, done to-day by regulation. It has become the habit of this Parliament to pass Bills in such a form as to give the Minister of Trade and Customs power to make regulations to do that which this Parliament itself ought to do. We are constantly being supplied with sheafs of regulations which prove on examination to be practically legislation with regard to our Customs. The Minister has been given great powers to alter the Tariff from time to time in relation to what he thinks are inconsistencies or anomalies. In the exercise of that power he has dealt with many matters which ought to have come before this House if we could have conveniently dealt with them without interfering with the ordinary routine of our business. In my opinion, no Minister ought to have such a power. Nothing should be done by a Minister which ought really to be dealt with by Parliament. I am sure that if some of the regulations which have been passed were inquired into it would be found that they depended very much on the fiscal belief of the Minister at the head of the Department at the time they were framed. The power to make regulations should be so limited as to make it immaterial what view the Minister of Trade and Customs held on the fiscal question. The appointment of the proposed Commission would obviate the present difficulty in that regard, for I take it that no regulation would be made having the effect of modifying exist ing Customs legislation except on Parliament&#39;s recommendation. The Commission will have to be of an unbiased character. It must consist of men disconnected with political affairs, and with the manufacturing and importing industries - of men sufficiently above suspicion as to be fit for the high altitude which they will occupy. </para>

              <para>- I do not know how the honorable member thinks many high positions are filled at the present time. I do not know whether he would suspect our Judges of taking bribes or suppose that heads of public Departments can be influenced by backsheesh or commissions ; but I have a much higher belief in human nature than to imagine anything of the kind. Just as we can obtain, for our Bench and our public Departments, men of unbiased character - men above suspicion cf selling their judgments or their official powers - so I think we can obtain men to form this Commission who would be quite above suspicion. I have no sympathy with any honorable member who is constantly insinuating that we cannot get men with honest, well-balanced minds to fill these positions, and sufficiently honorable to enable us to accept their recommendations with confidence. I can only say that those who make such suggestions must have a low estimate of human nature. </para>

              <para>- I was endeavouring to give reasons which seem to me capable of presentation in support of this motion ; and now I shall refer to the extraordinary interpretation which this House has puton the word &#34;anomalies.&#34; We know very well that prior to the appointment of the Tariff Commission, which led to ten or twelve months&#39; debate in the House, the complaint made by the honorable member for Hume and two or three others associated with him was that the Tariff was full of anomalies, which required to be amended. That was the spark which lighted the fire - the movement that led to a new Tariff and to the many months of discussion. The word &#34;anomalies,&#34; correctly speaking, has a very much more restricted meaning than that placed upon it in this House. But I venture to say that a Commission of the type of men which the honorable member has suggested would never by their recommendations stir up such a great fiscal struggle as was experienced two or three years ago. It occurred to me, in the course of the honorable member&#39;s speech, that his proposal borders very much on the proposal which the Government have already made to establish a body in the nature of a Board of Trade. Honorable members opposite, when the honorable member for Maribyrnong was speaking, insinuated that it was very unlikely r.hat a Fusion Government would ever bring in such a Bill. I should like to say, without desiring to specially champion the Government, that I think they have already made a suggestion of legislation which will cover the proposals submitted by. the honorable member for Maribyrnong. </para>

              <para>- The Government propose, in the first place, an InterState Commerce Commission to which the question of new Protection is to be referred, and which I think should be invested with a number of other functions. If I am not mistaken in my recollection, the proposals of the Government include a body, the functions of which are in the nature of those of a Board of Trade. Any one who knows anything of the history of the British Board of Trade must be aware that during the last twenty years that State Department, which began in a very small way, has developed a number of functions and duties which were hardly contemplated at the beginning. I have had occasion to study the history of the Board of Trade; and any one who does the same will fee astonished at the multiplicity of the State energies which it is exercising at the present time. Such work as has been indicated this afternoon would come quite properly within its jurisdiction ; and I hope that when the Minister addresses himself to the question he will be able to tell us that what is now suggested in a separate motion is part and parcel of the comprehensive proposals which the Government intend to make in some Bill in the near future for the appointment of an Inter-State Commerce Commission. The difficulty will be the choice of men, if a separate body for the purpose be appointed as suggested by the honorable member for Maribyrnong ; not because there are not men honest enough for the position, but because they must be men not directly engaged in commerce or industry. They will have to oc cupy the same impartial position in regard to commerce and industry that Judges occupy in regard to the interests of suitors. Every business man knows that frequently in a Court a Judge has said, &#34;I cannot deal with this case, because I happen to be a shareholder in such-and-such company.&#34; That is only one instance of the very great care which men who sit on the Bench exercise in order to keep their minds in- a proper state of balance, so that there shall be no possible suspicion of their judicial and impartial attitude on any question that comes before them for trial. Lately, in a very important matter in the High Court, two Judges expressed their disinclination to sit, because some years ago they had been interested in certain legal proceedings which intimately, touched the issues they were being called upon to try. I hope that honorable members, who are not as familiar as I am, perhaps, with the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of the different Benches of Australia, from that of the magistrates up to the High Court, will believe me when I say that I think there is no country in the world in which a finer, more impartial, and more judicial body of men sit on the Bench than in Australia. I quite believe that outside the legal profession, mercantile, or commercial people could be obtained who would apply the same impartial and judicial treatment to any question concerning the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- Quite so, not directly engaged; but they must be men with commercial knowledge. I possess commercial knowledge, having had many years experience as a ship-owner and merchant ; and if I were disposed to accept such a position - though I wish my suspicious fellow members to understand that I am not a candidate - I think  T  could hold the scales fairly. I commend the honorable member for Maribyrnong for submitting this motion, though I claim to be the godfather of it - if he will allow me to say so - seeing that it is exactly what I proposed when the Tariff was before us. The treatment of the recommendations of the last Tariff Commission by the honorable member for Hume was one of the chief causes why I made the proposal. I did not think that the honorable member dealt properly -or fairly with the Commis-  sion on the report of which the Tariff was founded. Whether the suggestion in the motion be carried out as part of a more comprehensive scheme to be introduced by the Government, or whether it be done on a separate proposal bv the honorable member for Maribyrnong, I wish it all success. I shall be very glad to help in passing it into law in order that we may have a permanent and impartial tribunal to deal with difficult questions and thus relieve the House of detail. Every day it is becoming more apparent in the Parliaments of the world, that legislative bodies must cease dealing with details and confine themselves to general principles of legislation^ delegating the  duty  of collecting information to Commissions and Boards, which need not, but may be, embodied in the laws of the  country </para>

            <para>.  - It is almost amusing to witness this newborn zeal displayed by the honorable member for Maribymong regarding the Tariff at the present time, and it is remarkable to find him and the honorable member for Parkes so much in agreement. I altogether disagree with the honorable member for Maribyrnong when he says&#39; that the Tariff is not in the satisfactory state it ought to be in because of the absence of information. There were hundreds of items on which we had all the information that was necessary. &#39;.Information had been collected from all parts of the world by the very best experts; but what was the result? The reason that the Tariff is unsatisfactory is,&#39; principally, the action of the Victorian friends of the honorable member for Maribyrnong. Members of this House who went before the country pledged to Protection came here, and, time after time, voted, at any rate, for revenue duties; and those honorable members would do precisely the same if there were- a. hundred Commissions. It will be admitted, I think, that on the Tariff Commission there were not only able men from inside Parliament, but at least two from outside, of the character described by the honorable member for Parkes - business men of wide knowledge and high character, on whom we could rely. Did their reports influence honorable members? Not a single whit. It seems to me that the moment this Fusion Government are faced with something that should be done, they seek to relegate it to a Board or Commission, and thus provide a few more billets for some of their supporters. There is a great analogy between the proposal before vs and the proposal of the Prime Minister ; and each covers so much that it would require about fifty years before much information could be got on any one subject. The motion of the honorable member for Maribyrnong proposes the appointment of men who are to continuously watch the operations of the Tariff, consider its relations to preference - that is, they are to get information from Great Britain and all other countries - and deal with all questions relating to manufacturing and agricultural industries in view of our commercial relations, throughout the whole civilized world. 1 could understand a proposal to have a Board to report on anomalies, so as to leave the House no excuse for doing nothing. The honorable member for Maribyrnong has persistently tried to misrepresent my views in regard to the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- It is one thing to quote, and another thing to give a wrong interpretation. I do not think that I voted for every duty proposed, because, in one or two cases, I thought the duty would be iniquitous; but there are very few duties that I did not support, and I am prepared to support higher ones. The honorable member for Maribyrnong, in reading a quotation from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> gave the House the impression that, when speaking for myself, I was also speaking for my colleagues. What I said is absolutely correct, for does the honorable member believe &#39;That any section of the House is going to deal with the Tariff - I do not say the anomalies - within three years? Nearly half of that time has expired now, and I am sure not- a single . honorable member is ready to open up the whole Tariff in the last session of this Parliament, unless it is the honorable member for Maribyrnong himself, and he will not be able to induce the Prime Minister to support him. But I do not think that even he is willing to open up trie whole Tariff within three years from the time of its passage. There is, however, no reason why we should not deal with anomalies now. Let me read from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> precisely what I did say - </para>

              <para>- We tried to do our work properly and  conscientiously,  but we had scarcely time to get in touch with our Departments. Several anomalies did come before the late Minister of Customs.  and  I saw some of them when 1 was acting in the Department, but they were not of  sufficient  importance to bring before Parliament at the moment. If it can be shown that there are anomalies working injury now to any of our manufacturing industries, why should we not deal with them? If the honorable member for Maribyrnong had produced any cases of that kind, instead of trying to obtain a good &#34;advertisement for use at the next election, he would have done some good. Let him come down with anomalies, and ascertain whether honorable members on this side will help him to rectify them, before he says that we do not want to touch the Tariff for three years. Although the honorable member for Yarra was Minister of Customs for only a few months, he proposed, in the most practical way, to deal with the subject embodied in this motion.  His  method was far more satisfactory than that proposed by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. It  was to ask the British Government to call an International Conference, in order to adopt a scheme that would protect the revenue, not only of Australia, but of the Old Country, and all other countries. </para>

              <para>- It is the duty of the Government and the House to do it. While it is quite true, as the honorable member for Parkes said, that, in dealing with the Tariff, we were supplied by manufacturers with a great deal of information which was not reliable, we were supplied also with a great deal that was reliable. I took considerable trouble in some cases to verify the information sent in, and when I found that an attempt had been made to mislead myself and the House, I threw it into the waste-paper basket. It does not matter what information we get in regard to different items, because some honorable members will vote for party purposes, and others will vote in a certain way because they have a foolish idea that if they do what is right, their constituents will not approve of it. They do not look at the justice of the thing at all ; but simply ask themselves how they will appear before their electors if they vote in a certain way. If that were not so, scores of the votes given on the Tariff by honorable members who then sat in the Opposition corner, would not have been given at all. I do not know how they are going to fare with their electors when they do go to the country. If they do not get a bad time, they ought to. If the Tariff is not what it ought to be. it is in the power of the Department to get all the information necessary. The honorable member for Hume may remember that, when it was introduced, I said to him in a casual conversation that the wisest course had not been adopted, as I should have liked to see all the raw materials that could not be obtained in Australia placed toy themselves. As a high Protectionist, I had no desire to see any duty imposed upon articles that are not grown or produced here, or are not likely to be in the near future. If we had known what raw materials could not be got in Australia at present, we should have known what measure of protection we were giving to certain industries. Instead of that, we had to take the whole thing haphazard, with the result that, while we appeared to be giving a high duty in some cases, we were really giving only a revenue duty, although that was not the fault of the House. The Customs Department, before the honorable member for Yarra left it, had begun to take note of the anomalies, and, if the honorable member for Maribyrnong will approach the present Minister of Customs, and see that that work is carried on, he will find that we can rectify the anomalies in about one-tenth of the time that would be taken if a Board such as he suggests were appointed. While it may be necessary later on to appoint a Board of that kind, it is not at all necessary now. The anomalies have been so few that even such a zealous member as the honorable member for Maribyrnong has not mentioned one of them in his speech today. Does he know of any anomalies? </para>

              <para>- Will the honorable member for Lang help him to abolish anomalies by making the Tariff higher than it is at present? This motion is a mere piece of advertising on the part of the honorable member for Maribyrnong, because the question for the Fusion party is how they are to act in regard to rectifying anomalies. Half of them would refuse to rectify them in the direction desired by the honorable member for Maribyrnong. They would vote for reducing duties, but the honorable member for Maribyrnong would not go with them in that. If he finds an anomaly where the duty is too low,, the honorable member for Parkes will not help him to raise the duty. Consequently, we are in such a position, and will be until the Fusion is ended, that we can do nothing practical to encourage and extend our great industries. There is so little in the motion that it is needless to occupy the time of the House any longer upon it, and there are on the notice-paper two other motions of considerable importance. As the honorable member for Maribyrnong has had his say, and has not asked us to do anything practical, can he tell me any anomalies that require to be rectified? If <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> cannot get a reply from him, I must take it for granted that this motion is a display for electioneering purposes. </para>

            <para>. - I take it that the object of the motion is not only to deal with anomalies, but to secure a Board, on the lines of the British Board of Trade, which will include, as the motion states, representatives of particular staple interests affected by Customs Tariff Acts. It . should also include &#39; representatives of the commercial and industrial interests of the Commonwealth generally, because, if it is to be permanent, it should have very large functions, extending a great deal beyond those outlined in the motion. The question of anomalies has occupied the attention of the House for a considerable time. We have heard of nothing but anomalies since the Tariff was passed. In my opinion, it is full, of anomalies, from first to last. In fact, the whole Tariff is an .anomaly. An industry cannot be protected, except at the expense of the community, and while Protection may benefit certain classes of producers, it places others at a disadvantage. Therefore anomalies are at once created simultaneously with Tariff restrictions upon trade. There is hardly an item in the Tariff&#39; which cannot be correctly described as an anomaly, and, therefore, the rectification of anomalies means the opening  of  the whole Tariff. A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into and report upon the anomalies of the first Commonwealth Tariff, and to make recommendations for their rectification. After many months of inquiry, it presented a number of progress reports, a further final report, and an immense mass of evidence. In most cases, the recommendations of the Free Trade members of the Commission were contrary to those of the Protectionist members, unanimity being secured in regard to only a few matters. </para>

              <para>- Members were forced to weigh the evidence for themselves, and drew different conclusions from the same premises, with the result that the whole Tariff was ripped open. I do not know whether that is proposed again, but there will be wide divergence of opinion when the rectification of anomalies is brought forward. Some honorable members will wish to raise duties, and others, of whom I am one, to reduce them. The greatest hardships inflicted under the present Tariff were inflicted by the Protectionist votes of Free Trade Labour members, and I can hope for no reduction in the process of rectification from this Parliament where the. reliableFree Traders are so few in number. My attention has been specially directed to the effect of Protection upon the clothing industry, and an employ&#233; in that business has written to me a letter in which he says - </para>

            <para>I have been in the trade for seventeen years, eight of which were prior to Federation, nine years of which were since the foundation of that State and under Protection. During the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> it was usual for trade to look up for the new season in August, and by September full steam might be said to be the term right on to Christmas. Work would then bc slow until the completion of stock-taking at the end of January. February would seea fresh start made in the factories&#39;, which would continue right on until the end of May. From August to Christmas it was common to work a considerable amount of overtime; indeed, I have known men to dispute with the employer for being asked to work on Saturday afternoon. After Federation, things, from the trade point of view, seem to have been reversed. For a couple of years there was absolutely nothing. Of course, there was the drought, which no doubt affected trade. But that unpleasant condition is at an end, but yet we have not recovered as far as clothing is concerned. Last year, October was on us before trade began to get way on, and even after that men did not get full time; also after Christmas it was well on to March before men were being sought for. All this time the factories have done practically no overtime. </para>

            <para>How would you describe the work conditions in factories of five years ago and to-day? - About ten years ago I came over from Melbourne. I put in ten months at Wallace&#39;s as a stock cutter; I left there and went to Finlayson&#39;s, and then went back to Melbourne. It was even better then than now. You could get more money, and you did not have to work so hard. </para>

            <para>Your view is that conditions have not changed for the better? - No, they have not. </para>
            <para>When the matter was before the Court some five years ago they granted a minimum wage of 50s. Could you give me any reason why a higher wage should be granted now than five years ago? - The purchasing power of money is less now. </para>
            <para>Put that aside - is  theTe  any reason you can suggest, supposing the Court was right then, they came to the conclusion that 50s. was a fair minimum, why it should be very much more now? - I cannot say. I was not here five years ago. Things were much better ten years ago. </para>
            <para>What money did you get then? - I got 55s. at Wallace&#39;s, and&#163;3 10s. at Finlayson&#39;s. I cut under agreement. </para>
            <para>You get &#163;3 now? - Yes. That is what I got when I was out of my apprenticeship. </para>

          <para>. - I  desire to call the attention of the House to a matter which certainly affects my own constituency, but is more substantial than are most grievances which are ordinarily dealt with on this motion. I refer to the delay that has taken place in the negotiations relative to the Federal Capital. The failure to make progress with them certainly does not lie at the door of either the present Government or its predecessors. We have had laid upon the table a copy of the communications that have passed between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales, and I propose to draw attention to the dates of the several letters in order to show that, whilst the negotiations on the part of the Commonwealth have proceeded with sufficient rapidity, . the Premier of New South Wales seems to be afflicted with the &#34;tired feeling,&#34; and to be quite unable to deal with this important and urgent question with that reasonable despatch that we might fairly expect. The first communication relative to the matter was addressed by the ex-Prime Minister to the Premier of New South Wales on 16th March last. In that letter the honorable member for Wide Bay pointed out that it was desired that there should be no further alienation of Crown lands, and no granting of long leasesof land within the area indicated by the surveyor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scriviner.</inline> No reply was made to that communication until 30th April. It is true that the Government of New South Wales took steps to comply with the Prime Minister&#39;s request, but, although on 31st March there was published in the State <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> an order reserving from sale generally and from lease any of the lands within the proposed Federal area, the Premier did not advise the Commonwealth Government of that action until a month later. On 2nd April the ex-Prime Minister addressed a further letter to the Premier of New South Wales intimating that his Government was anxious to enter into negotiations as early as possible on this important subject, and. would be pleased to have a map showing the unalienated Crown landsin the district and the nature of the occupation, if any, of them. Save for a mere acknowledgment of its receipt, no reply to that letter was sent until 18th May, so that there was a delay of over a month. </para>

            <para>- If the Premier of New South Wales had realized the urgency of the matter, the map could have been prepared within considerably less time than was actually occupied. On 20th July last, the present Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of New South Wales inviting attention to the correspondence to which i have already referred, and asking for certain information upon the subject. That letter was not answered until 5th August. The delay was considerable, having regard to the fact that we have, at our disposal, but a few months within which to deal with a mass of important business, and that if the next step in regard to the establishment of the Capital be not taken within two or three months, the whole subject may have to be re-opened by the next Parliament. I admit that the letter written by the Prime Minister involved some legal considerations, but I cannot help thinking that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> or any other lawyer, were requested by an important clientto furnish an opinion upon an equally difficult question, he would not ask. him to wait so long to obtain it. The reply from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> dated 5th August, reached Melbourne on Friday, 6th August, and on the succeeding Tuesday the Prime Minister, in answer to a question which I put, said that he had considered the communication, and that he had obtained from the Attorney-General a memorandum on the subject which would be sent to the Premier of New South Wales. In other words, the letter from the Premier of New South Wales did not reach the Prime Minister until Friday, 6th August, and on the following Tuesday a memorandum in reply was prepared and ready to be sent to him. Under the heading of &#34;An Unopened Letter&#34; there appears in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a statement in regard to that communication. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> apparently was so busy while in Melbourne that he allowed it to remain unopened for several days.

        <para class="block">We have a right to complain of the funereal slowness with which the Premier of New South Wales has carried on his part of the negotiations. In one of his communications he has indicated certain difficulties which, on the face of them, appear to be absurd. He points out that the Federal Parliament has not declared the precise boundaries of the territory that it desires to acquire, and expresses the fear that it may not accept the area- which the New South Wales Government surrenders, with the result that the State will be placed in a most invidious position. To use his own words - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>On the other hand, the State at present is in a most anomalous position. The procedure indicated by the Constitution is for the State to surrender by virtue of section in all lands which are Crown lands. The Constitution further provides (section in) that, on surrender, such part of the State becomes subject to  the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The State thus is irrevocably divested of proprietorial and territorial rights in respect of lands so surrendered, and the Constitution contemplates that that land must be within boundaries which have been determined by the Parliament to be the territory within which shall be established the seat of Government. </para>

        <para>His contention is that if New South Wales surrenders the land and we do not accept it, some shocking calamity may overtake New South Wales. If South Australia, which proposes to hand over the Northern </para>
        <para class="block">Territory to the Commonwealth, adopted the same attitude and said to the Commonwealth Parliament, &#34; You must show us the exact boundaries of the Northern Territory before we agree to hand it over to you,&#34; we should not be any further forward with the negotiations. Of course, such a difficulty does not arise. South Australia will pass the Act surrendering the Territory to the Commonwealth, and if we do not accept, it will not matter, because South Australia will not be in any worse position. The same might very well apply to the State Government of New South Wales. The time is very short now within which to enable this Parliament to take the next step ; and there are a number of legal difficulties that may present themselves when the step is taken. A question has been raised as to whether the New South Wales Government are prepared to grant the Commonwealth power to generate electricity from the waters of the Snowy River, should it be subsequently required. A question has also been raised as to the powers of the Federal Government in erecting certain works at Jervis Bay, and making certain improvements to the harbor ; and a difficulty may easily arise as to the working of the New South Wales railways through Yass, Queanbeyan, and other places that may be affected within the Federal area. Each and all of these may become substantial questions, calculated to cause delay. If there is to be such a great deal of time occupied in preliminary skirmishes as to who shall make the first move- </para>

            <para>- I am not proposing anything, nor am I blaming the present Government in connexion with the matter.  I  thought that when only  ,&#163;5,000  was proposed, it was too little; but, judging by the rate at which the negotiations are being carried on, I should say that <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> for postage stamps would have been sufficient. I can conceive of no way in which we can convey our . feelings to the New South Wales Premier ; but, unless an alteration is made, and the New South Wales Parliament is prepared to act promptly, this question will certainly be locked up for years to come. The late Government were prepared to carry out the behest of this Parliament, and indicated an area they were prepared to accept. The present Government have taken a similar step ; and if the Premier of New South Wales is going to stand off, and ask this Parliament to make the next move, he is taking a course which will inevitably re-open the whole question. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> has asked for certain other information, and he has indicated that at the back of his mind is the idea that if we do not take the first step, he may do so; and we may fairly hope that we shall hear no more of unopened letters, or have any further delay in answering correspondence. If we could see the same expedition on the part of New South Wales that has been shown by the Commonwealth, we could hope for a substantial advance towards the creation of a Federal Capital within the life of this Parliament; but, otherwise, I shall have to own with regret that the fault does not lie at the door of honorable members here. I have no doubt that there is a section of this Parliament which would be very glad to see this question postponed until after the next elections, and there is also a section of public opinion, as represented by the Melbourne newspapers, which would move heaven and earth to block the matter for a few months. The Premier of New South Wales, by his action, is playing into the hands of those people ; but I hope that our next news will be that the New South Wales Parliament has set itself to seriously consider the question. </para>

          <para>.- This question must be regarded as one entirely of a non-party character, and one in regard&#39; to which this Parliament, since it has expressed an opinion, has done its duty, and is now waiting with some impatience, I hope, and much dissatisfaction, to see what the other party to the contract intends to do. In the past New South Wales has, at intervals, delivered itself of many protests, which were entirely justified/ in regard to the delay, which had become almost intolerable, on the part of the Commonwealth, but now, although tardily, we have done our duty. I am really surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> should take up an attitude which might be entirely justifiable if he were acting for a client whose interests were threatened by some action of the other side, but which, in the leader and representative . of a great State, to which we are only anxious to do what we are pledged to do under the Constitution, seems to be altogether inexplicable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> says - and so far as I know, it is for him an entirely new discovery - that the proper procedure is for the Commonwealth to do something, after which, he, on his part, will do something - that if he takes any step which we ought to take, it will place him in an invidious and false position. I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> that if he has the interests of New South Wales at heart, he must not hesitate a day in going on with this matter; and I warn him that, if he neglects to take this chance, he will never get another. He will certainly never get a better chance, and I db not think he will get so good a one. The circumstances under which this Parliament agreed to the Yass-Canberra site were almost unique. The factors&#34; that made for that selection may at any moment disappear. </para>

            <para>- I am not speaking about individuals disappearing, but of the circumstances which actuated certain individuals. There may be no change in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of Parliament, yet, there may be a very great change of opinions. This Parliament has no control over the next Parliament, which will enter into the performance of its duties absolutely untrammelled by any decision of ours. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> is in danger of sacrificing the interests of New South Wales by insisting on a pettifogging interpretation of the Constitution ; his position is rather that of a police court solicitor than that of the leader of the New South Wales bar. I am very sorry that this should be so, because his attitude seems to reflect on the legal profession in general, and to give some colour to the continuous complaint that is made against an honorable, and, I hope, broadminded profession, that the members of it are unable to see in words that plain meaning which every intelligent man in the country can see. We knew what the Parliament intended, and what was meant, when we assented to the Yass-Canberra site. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> at that time was perfectly cognisant of our intention, and ought to have been thoroughly seized of the purport of our enactment ; but, ^instead, he, at the eleventh hour - at a moment when he should be only too anxious to smooth away difficulties - raises this new point. Even if there had been any doubt as to who should make the next move, he ought not to have raised the point, because that was for counsel on the other side to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline></para>

        <para class="block">Wade has committed an error which, had it arisen in the exercise of his profession, would certainly not have endeared him to his client, or helped him to extend- his practice. While the present Minister of Home Affairs is in office, we may feel quite sure, though we differ from him in other matters, that he will throw no obstacles in the way of a speedy and complete settlement of this question. If diplomacy, and a sort of hesitant attitude were permissible or excusable, he is in a position in which it might be excused, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade,</inline> on the other hand, is showing a disposition to take something which he has said for a very long time he wants very much. This Parliament, after considerable delay, decided to do that which New . South Wales wished to be done, and it is now for New South Wales to do what is necessary, and to throw on us the onus of declining to proceed. I believe that this Parliament will not decline ; and it is for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> to take that view which we must presume he took when the decision was made. The honorable member for Coolgardie, the exMinister of Home Affairs, knows very well that right through all the negotiations, quasi-official and official, the suggestion now made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> was never mentioned until the other day. I am not at all- criticising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade&#39;s</inline> intentions, for, no doubt, he means well enough. I simply say that he is making a mistake which threatens to be a fatal one for New South Wales. Upon that I take my stand as a representative of the State, who is very much .-interested in the matter, and wishes to see it well out of the road, because, in the hurly-burly of politics - and they threaten to be very hurly and very burly in the near future - goodness knows what may happen to a question of this sort, which is tame and domestic compared with the fierce untrammelled beasts that will walk the political earth in the near future. It is like exposing a sheep to the unfettered ferocity of the carnivora in the cages at the Zoological Gardens. I hope, therefore, that we may settle this question at once. I did hear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> had been so busy that he could not open the Prime Minister&#39;s last letter. I trust he has got over that little difficulty. I do not know what the Prime Minister said in his letter, but I hope he put the view which we&#34; took when we dealt with the matter, that it was the business of the Parliament of New South Wales to hand over to us such territory as we had indicated. The question of when the metes and bounds should be definitely fixed is one that the Department of Home Affairs might well be left to adjust with the New South Wales authorities, but I think we are entitled to receive at once from the Parliament of New South Wales authority to take within certain points as much land as is sufficient. From what I know of the Parliament of New South Wales, and the temper of the people of that State, if they had a chance tomorrow, and the question was made a nonparty one, I do not hesitate to say that the Bill would go through the Parliament at almost record rate, and that if it were submitted to the people they would adopt it without hesitation and by an enormous majority. </para>

          <para>.- Some time ago I drew the attention of the Minister of External Affairs to the proposal to admit a Japanese doctor to practise at Broome, in Western Australia. The honorable gentleman was good enough to say then that he would defer his decision in the matter until he had received the correspondence from the district which I had promised him. Since then he has received the correspondence, and now he informs me in a letter which I received recently from his office that, &#34; In view of the information that the doctor to arrive appears to possess the necessary qualifications, the exemption of three years officially promised to the Japanese Consul -General in April last to enable him to enter solely for the. purpose of practising his profession at the place mentioned cannot be withheld, and will issue subject to the qualification required by the law of Western Australia being established at the earliest possible date.&#34; I have no wish to dwell upon the circumstances under which the official promise was given by the Department to the Consul-General for Japan. I believe it was given in the absence of the late Minister of External Affairs in Papua. I do not wish to cast any reflection on the official concerned, because it must be recognised that every Minister is responsible for the actions of his subordinates ; but I contend that a grave mistake was made in this case, and the Government might have taken some means to endeavour to prevent the results which will certainly follow if this gentleman is allowed to land and practise his profession. In the first place, I may state that nearly three-fourths of the inhabitants of </para>

        <para class="block">Broome are coloured people. The Western Australian Government, as the Treasurer is well aware, go to considerable expense in subsidising a medical man in outlying localities such as Broome. At present the local medical man is a highly qualified practitioner, and is giving the fullest satisfaction to white people and Japanese alike, according to my information - and I have letters here from the member for the district, the mayor of the town, and several other local people. It is pointed out that if this Japanese is allowed to practise his profession in Broome he will take away from the European doctor the bulk of his practice, and that will have rather unpleasant results for the white residents. It will mean, in all probability, that the European medical man will be obliged to retire, and the white residents of Broome - who include a large number of men owning pearling fleets - will be compelled if they fall ill or require an operation to intrust themselves to the skill of the foreigner. I say nothing against that gentleman&#39;s medical qualifications, .but if any honorable member had to choose between a practitioner of his own race and a coloured practitioner, he would, of course, select the man of his own race. </para>

            <para>- Fortunately there are not many white women there, though the number is increasing. That white women should be driven to seek the aid of a coloured doctor strengthens considerably my case, but I think it is sufficiently strong as it is. In the opinion of the owners of the pearling fleets the presence of this gentleman in Broome will breed trouble between them and their crews. I am not in a position to say how far that statement can be borne out. Of course, they do not tell me in their letters the reasons why that should be so, but the statement appears in two of the documents which have reached me. It is stated also, as I have just mentioned, that the income of the local European medical officer must be largely diminished, and that that would cause a demand for an increased subsidy from the Government, or otherwise the residents would have to be satisfied &#34; with the services of a man of inferior capacity.&#34; </para>

          <para>I cannot see that there exists any justification for the introduction of such a doctor, as the men have at all times received excellent attention, and are, when necessary, provided with beds in the hospital ; also, a special building has been erected for the treatment of .berri-berri cases. It appears to me, in granting such an exemption, the Government are committing an act for which they have no precedent, and, further, are creating a precedent of the most dangerous nature, for it stands to reason if a doctor is allowed to land then there is no logical reason why a Japanese lawyer or a Japanese priest should not also be required. </para>

        <para class="block">That is a point worth noticing. He points out also that there are a considerable number of Afghans located at Port Hedland, a little south of Broome, and that they and other Asiatic races wouid be justified in demanding the same consideration. And if it should be demanded, I do not see how a refusal can be logically defended after this precedent. I regret to notice that the Government attempt to throw upon the Western Australian authorities the responsibility of preventing this gentleman from practising. </para>

We are entitled to know whether a Japanese is now on his way to Australia, and whether, having reviewed all the circumstances of the case, the Minister of External Affairs will not recommend his colleagues to inform the Consul-General of Japan, without giving offence to his nation, that the permission to land has been revoked, taking care to see that no pecuniary loss is suffered by the doctor appointed, should he be on his way here. The people of Broome have a claim to the consideration of the Government. They, as well as the Government of Western Australia, will be placed in a difficult position if their representations are ignored. There is no reason why the Japanese pearlers should have a practitioner of their own race to attend to them. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to direct attention to a matter of very great importance to our producers. The regulations framed last year, limiting the size of wheat bags, have proved very acceptable. Though at first many opposed the reduction which has been made, it has been found that the honorable member for EdenMonaro has benefited all concerned in the handling of wheat. But, while the intention of Parliament was that not more than 200 lbs. of wheat should be placed in one bag, the regulations have been so framed that the bags which comply with them will not hold 200 lbs. of &#34; f.a.q.&#34; wheat. Therefore, an alteration is necessary to give effect to our intention. In view of another difficulty, I have already asked whether the Government cannot frame regulations which, while preventing more than 200 lbs. of wheat from being put into any one bag, will not prohibit the importation of bags of larger sizes to hold commodities of less weight. I have been approached by different public bodies in my electorate, which have pointed out that, as the original bags are getting worn out, it is found difficult to obtain bags which will hold a reasonable weight of oats and potatoes. Chaff, too, in the future, will have to be put into bran bags, unless the regulations are amended. The honorable member for Wilmot and others have referred to this matter. </para>

The cases which I shall cite may be regarded as typical. In one instance, a pensioner lives 45 miles from his warranty, and has no convenient way of travelling that distance. Another pensioner, a widow, lives seventeen miles away, and is without a conveyance; yet she must be seen by her warranty about once a month. A third pensioner, also a widow, is physically unable to travel. </para>

        <para class="block">Government medical officer must be allowed the right of private practice to supplement his official salary. No doubt the honor able member is voicing the democratic spirit of Western Australia in bringing this matter forward; but, while we have a perfect right to refuse to allow a Japanese to land in Australia, we must not forget that the Japanese are equally entitled to refuse permission to an Australian to land in their country. Certain merchants in Sydney sought to bring pressure to bear upon the Consul-General for Japan to prevent my landing in Japan on the occasion of a visit which I paid to that country some time ago, but he courteously refused to take notice of their representations, which were made, not in the open light of day, but in a most underhand manner. Had the authorities refused to allow me to land, I should hare had to kiss my hand to the shore, and to regret that I could .not obtain a closer view of the beauties of that country. If we say that this&#34; Japanese medical man shall not be admitted, we must not complain if the Japanese exercise their right to exclude us from their shores. As one who believes in a White Australia, I am willing to accept the risk, but I urge that we should not resort to any subterfuge. Let us say straight out that it is in the interests of a White Australia that we are determined tq take this stand. No word of insult will ever leave my lips with respect to Japan or its people. It is a great nation of clever and ingenious people, and I know that the white man could not compete on equal terms with the Japanese. It is for the latter reason that I fear their entry into Australia. The Treasurer was Premier of Western Australia when I had the privilege of practising at Albany. I must say, however, that the State Government have some strange ways of administering the Medical Act, for I know of a medical man who paid two fees, of <inline font-style="italic">^&#163;2</inline> 2s. each, to be registered there ; and, although his application was refused, did not obtain a refund. On one occasion, I, with another Melbourne medico, was sent to perform a <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> upon a child at Albany; but, although we did the work, we were never paid for it. The Government directed another medical man to hold the <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem,</inline> and paid him, although, as a matter of fact, the work had already been done, and he could not make a second <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> examination. I am satisfied that, unless this Japanese doctor has the diplomas .which are set forth in the schedule to the Act, he will not be permitted to practise. If he has. not, we shall find a simple way out of the difficulty. If, on the other hand, he has the requisite qualifications, and we refuse to allow him to settle in Australia, we must not complain if any Australian is forbidden to enter Japan. . </para>

In New South Wales, the municipalities impose a tax on the unimproved value of land, so that their valuations do not afford a reliable basis for ascertaining the actual value of the small cottages owned by some of the aged poor.

            <para>- This letter shows that the law is being disregarded. A young woman who earns her living, at the washtub must find it difficult enough to clothe herself decently, without having to pay for accommodation, and it is to the credit of the young woman in this case that she looks after her aged father. I know that instructions have been given with a view to the valuation of the homes of applicants for old-age pensions being placed at the highest possible limit, so as to reduce the amount of the pensions granted. </para>

            <para>- I have just re.ad a statement on the subject contained in a. letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clegg,</inline> head of the Department in New South Wales. He states that he was &#34;advised&#34; that this course had to be followed, and I wish to know now by whom such advice has been given. In New South Wales there is in existence a Miners&#39; Accident Relief Fund, to which some old-age pensioners have contributed as a form of assurance. They are now receiving from that fund, in some cases, a small allowance, because they have suffered some permanent injury. The amount, or some proportion they receive from the accident fund, is being deducted from their pensions. This is purely a case of administration of the Act, the interpretation section of which provides -  &#34; Income &#34; means any moneys, valuable consideration, or profits earned derived or received by any person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source whatever, whether in or out of the Commonwealth, and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment - </para>

            <para>- We have been discussing grievances for barely an hour and, a half, and yet we are accused of trying to block the passing of the Works Estimates ! Such an attitude on the part of the Government is miserable in the extreme, lt is well known that if the Government had submitted the Works Estimates prior to the adjournment for the Premiers&#39; Conference, no opposition would haw been raised to their passing after reasonable examination by honorable members. What I desire to say is that the White Australia policy is being endangered by the proposal to permit the landing of a Japanese doctor to practise in Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- Is the honorable member for Bourke not prepared to accept the statement of the late Minister of External Affairs that he was not acquainted with the fact that the authority had been granted until the matter was mentioned in the House? The action of the Secretary to the Department is one which, in &#39;my opinion, should lead to his removal from his present responsible position. A short time ago, this officer was sent to Western Australia to make inquiries into the suspected smuggling of Chinese from luggers on the north-west coast. A considerable number of Chinese, apparently new chums, had been seen in gardens and various business places around Perth, and it was thought necessary to have an investigation made. But, as soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt landed, nearly every newspaper had a personal paragraph about him, and interviews with him; and the object of his business and visit was disclosed. An official on such a mission, who announces his object from the housetops, cannot hope for much success in discovering the facts. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman knows <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> and can say whether he was likely to give it. This appears to be a most serious attempt to break down the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. I take the gravest possible view of the matter. It is serious enough that one professional man should be admitted to practise at a certain place, but what makes it worse is that it creates a precedent for all future occasions. If the Japanese Consul-General makes a similar request regarding other places in Australia, are the Government going to refuse what they have granted in this case? The white residents at Broome are dependent upon one European doctor, who, in order to get a livelihood, has to depend, in addition to the Government subsidy, on the practice he secures from the Asiatics in that port. The prospect of those white residents being left without a white medical officer is sufficiently serious to justify the Government in reviewing their decision. Another point which I wish to bring under the attention of the Minister of External Affairs is the continued influx of Italians into Western Australia. The number who arrive in Western Australia, and go straight into employment ort some of the mines in the northern gold-fields and on the wood lines, seems to indicate that they are coming out under contract. If - so. they are infringing the contract immigration provisions of the Act. </para>

            <para>- The period extends over the last couple of years. These newchum Italians, who cannot speak a- word of English, land half-a-dozen or a dozen at a time. They seem to go straight off the boat at Fremantle to Kalgoorlie or the northern fields, and are employed almost immediately, while Britishers are walking round looking for work. The evidence appears overwhelming that they have an understanding, if not an actual contract, before they leave Italy, and the matter seems sufficiently serious to warrant an inquiry. I should like the attention of the Treasurer regarding the question of oldage pensions. There is no doubt that the section read by the honorable member for Newcastle was intended by Parliament to exempt persons who had been paying into a friendly society that granted an annuity at a certain age, or into a fund such as the Miners&#39; Relief Fund of New South Wales. A serious disability is now being imposed on them. </para>

If the Act has the effect of penalizing people, who have made small contributions out of an altogether insufficient wage, when they reach the age of sixty-five, that disability ought to be removed immediately from, the Act, and I hope the Treasurer will give immediate attention to the matter. &#39; I have heard from Western Australia that there has been considerable delay in the hearing of applications, and the payment of pensions. </para>

            <para>- Somebody is to blame, for the matter is very serious, and its effects may be further-reaching than we at present suspect. I am not concerned with the question of whether a particular Minister was or was not in Australia at the time. All I know is that when this took place the Fisher Government were in office, and they have to take the responsibility of their administration. I see no reason why this Japanese doctor should have been admitted. If a British medical man, possessing even the best qualifications, wishes to practise in Germany or France, the doors of those countries are not thrown open to him. There are many English residents in France and Germany who would naturally wish an English doctor to. attend them, yet a British doctor with the highest qualifications must pass the whole of the examinations that a native German or Frenchman must pass Defore he is allowed to practise there. I therefore see nothing wrong in objecting to the admission of a Japanese doctor to Australia. When the Tariff was being considered, and any technical question arose, the members of the Government sought the advice of those best able to speak on the subject, but in this case no attempt appears to have been made &#39; to consult the persons best able to judge. If the Government had asked any medical man his opinion on the matter, they would have learnt that the refusal to admit this gentleman would not be an outrage upon international law, because the same thing is done in all. foreign countries with regard to British medical men. I understand that the late Minister of External Affairs was not in Australia when the permission was granted, and apparently some reflection is cast upon an official connected with the Department. I know nothing of that, but I should like to see Ministers sufficiently strong to have the courage of their own opinions, and not to be dictated to by the various officials that they find in the Departments. Personally I find myself seriously inconvenienced, and I believe that is entirely due to the fact that the reports of the officers in connexion with various matters are given too much weight by Ministers. With regard to the Old-age Pensions Act. we cannot expect it to work smoothly all at once, but I do not think it is being administered altogether in the way that it should be. There must be some friction between the various Departments. I came across a case the other day in one of the outlying setttlements on the coast. I refer to a place called the Tea Gardens. Several old-age pensioners are living there, who, through their infirmity, are unable to travel long distances, as they have to do, to collect their pensions, and one of the tradesmen who visits the place in his launch was good enough to undertake to collect the money on the Thursday on which the pensions were paid, and distribute it, when going his rounds in his . launch, to those who could not go for the money. Sometimes the weather is bad, and he is unable to get away on the Thursday.. In this case, he requested the postmistress to hold the moneyover until the Saturday. He was told - red-tape again - that that was &#34; contrary to the regulations,&#34; and that the .money had to be sent back if not claimed on the Thursday. </para>

            <para>- Because, I presume, he did not care to hold it in his house until the Saturday, and it seemed a reasonable request that the postmistress should keep it in the post-office for a couple of days. Another matter, that I have already mentioned by means of a question, is the payment of pensions to inmates of charitable institutions. The present system presses very hardly upon the institutions within whose walls old-age. pensioners take refuge, because the pensions are stopped, and the institutions cannot draw anything to recoup them. </para>

            <para>- If I did vote against it, I am very sorry. I wish to draw-, attention to another matter in connexion with the electoral rolls, which also shows a certain amount of friction between Departments. The Electoral Act is administered by the Home Affairs Department, and the Post and Telegraph Act by the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department. I recently had occasion to travel through the country parts of my electorate, and was surprised, on asking at the post-offices for copies of the electoral rolls and application forms, to find that those in charge knew nothing of them. I discovered later that the papers had been sent out by the Electoral Department, but, as they were not accompanied with instructions from the Postal Department, they were merely thrown aside, like so much waste paper. The postal officials should be informed of the value of these documents, and told what to do with them. Another matter to which I desire to direct attention is the inconvenience caused by the want of reliable official clocks at postoffices. On one occasion, when I applied for a post-office clock for a town in my electorate, the application was refused, although a little later a post-office was erected at Corowa, with a tower containing a clock. On complaining about the matter, I was told that I had voted for the building. Surely that was an example of sharp practice ! </para>

          <para>. - When the Minister of External Affairs was asked for information regarding the proposed introduction of a Japanese doctor for Broome, and replied that he did not know anything about the matter, but would make inquiries, I interjected that if it had come before him at all, he must know something of it, because such applications are unusual. To my surprise, I was informed that the application had been made to the Department during my own term of office. The Immigration Restriction Act makes the Minister responsible for the granting of permits allowing aliens to land, and it might naturally be assumed that such mat,ters must come before him. But I was absent in New Guinea when the first application was made. The Secretary to the Department, I understand, intended to mention it to me, or thought that he had, and, when a second application came, he, knowing my general views, assumed that I had not expressed any objection to it.  <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Liddell.</inline> - Who acted in the honorable member&#39;s absence? </para>

            <para>- Yes. Unfortunately, difficulty has been created by the fact that there is not enough work at Broome for two doctors, so that the admission of a Japanese doctor may mean the exodus of the European doctor, unless the Government of Western Australia goes to the rescue. Had the application come before me, I should probably have given the permission asked for. </para>

            <para>- Two&#39; or three considerations would have weighed with me. In the first place, the request came through the Japanese Consul General, who has been of the greatest service to the Department in assisting it to prevent the coming here of Asiatic labourers, and has used his influence, when applied to, in inducing Japanese residents of Thursday Island and Queensland to leave the country. Naturally, therefore, any request made by him on behalf of Japanese residents would receive great consideration. Of course, the interests of the European residents of Broome must be properly protected. </para>

            <para>- I do not know. I have had only the same opportunities to obtain information as other honorable members enjoy. As the onus of granting or refusing admission to aliens is thrown on the Minister, the Secretary to the Department should be careful to obtain his approval in every case. A Minister can be held responsible only for acts of administration of which he has cognisance during his term of office. If they are unknown to him and are divulged only after he leaves office, then the responsibility for the action taken must rest with his successor, since with him alone rests the power of dealing with it. I certainly accept the responsibility for all acts of administration during my term of office. Speaking generally, I do not say that this was a wrongful admission, but it must be recognised that the only way in which I could rid myself of responsibility for a wrongful admission would be by reprimanding the officer who had permitted it, or by taking some other action in regard to &#39;him. If, however, I knew nothing of the matter, I could take no action. Had the person in question been a labourer or a pearler, instead of a doctor of medicine, would there have been such an outcry as there has been ? We have had, for instance, medical men in the House protesting in the strongest possible terms about the admission of this doctor, although I do not regard his admission as of more importance than would be the admission of a Japanese pearler or labourer. </para>

            <para>- I understand that the permission covers only a period of three years. There is not sufficient reason for the outcry that has been raised since not a word of complaint has been uttered in regard to the admission of other Asiatics who are not professional men. It is perfectly clear that technically the responsibility in this case rests upon my shoulders, although in reality it must lie with the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs, who believed that he would be carrying out my wishes in granting permission for the doctor to land. </para>

            <para>- It is new to me. Under the Contract Immigrants Act, which has been in operation for some time, we have power to make inquiries where it is suspected that a person is coming in under contract. The Customs officers are supposed to be vigilant in the administration of the law, and I shall make inquiries in order to ascertain whether they have in their possession information bearing out the suggestion that these men are coming in under contract, and if they have, action will follow to remedy the trouble. As to the admission of the Japanese doctor at Broome, the honorable member for Boothby was correct in saying that I first heard of the matter when a question was put to me in the House, and I promised in reply to inquireinto the subject. At a later stage I informed the House, in reply to a question, that there was nothing on the papers to show that the admission of the Japanese doctor had received Ministerial sanction. On making inquiries I found that the question of his admission originated in a conversation which took place in Sydney between the Secretary to the Japanese Consul-General and the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs. The latter was under the impression that he had mentioned it to the then Ministerial head of his Department, but he had no distinct recollection of the subject, and he, of course, accepts the assurance of the honorable member for Boothby that he did not bring it before him. </para>

            <para>- Not yet. In his letter to the Secretary of the Department, the Japanese Consul-General referred to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hayakawa,</inline> a Japanese medical man who had been given permission to reside and practise at Thursday Island for a period of three years. As a matter of fact, that gentleman practised there for only a short time, and no more was heard of him. Probably the knowledge of that precedent also influenced the Secretary of the Department in writing the letter in which permission was granted without formally obtaining the sanction of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I think that the duty of the Secretary was to mention the matter to the Minister of the day. Those who have had experience of the Secretary, however, well know that he always submits to the Minister of the day every case involving the slightest deviation from the known practice. The Secretary has often to act on verbal instructions given by the Minister when a number of cases are submitted to him, and it is not necessary for him, in some cases, to obtain even the authority of the Minister&#39;s initials.In the circumstances, therefore, it is impossible for the Secretary to remember what he did in every case. It is clear that the Minister was not aware of this case. </para>

        <para>The Japanese Consul-General communicated at once with somebody in Japan, and the doctor was engaged for a period of three years. The question now was whether the promise that was given should be withdrawn ; and as Minister, I felt that I was bound to honour it, but no action was taken pending the arrival of the protests from Western Australia. We had no knowledge of what the protests contained, but when they did arrive from the residents, the mayor, medical officer, and others at Broome, none appeared to be sufficient to cause us to withdraw the promise officially given, accepted in good faith, and acted upon. A letter was accordingly written to the Japanese Consul-General on the 25th August, as follows - </para>

            <para>- This is the first letter written for which I am personally responsible. At the same time, although the law of the State was not mentioned, the &#39;ConsulGeneral appears to have understood what &#34; qualified,&#34; in the previous letter to him, meant, because he had been in communication with the Western Australian Government on the subject. The only authority who could determine the qualification at law is, I presume, the Medical Board of the State. As a matter of fact, I am informed by those who are acquainted with the fact, that the Kyoto University is of very high standard, and that it is stated in the- <inline font-style="italic">Medical Register</inline> for 1909 - of which, unfortunately, I have not a copy - that, under the British Medical Act, the qualifications of Japanese institutions are recognised in the United Kingdom. The promise officially given must be honoured if the conditions are fulfilled; and that point is, I believe, thoroughly understood by the Japanese Consul-General. Of course, the qualification of the doctor has to be established. </para>

I should like to add to what the honorable member for Boothby has said, that the Japanese ConsulGeneral has assisted the Department very much indeed. Recently a rumour originated as to the rights of the Japanese at Port Darwin,  under the pearling arrangement, to remain there after the expiration of their engagement; and directly his attention was called to the fact, (he Japanese Consul-General took action, and put the matter right. Then, again, in regard to admission under passports, the Japanese Consul-General has acted with us, and preserved, as far as possible, the spirit of the arrangement. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to bring under the notice of the PostmasterGeneral the position taken up by the  Deputy  Postmaster- General in Sydney in regard to the payment to a man for work done in line repairing between Bourke and Brewarrina. This man was employed at 20s. a day to discover a fault in the telegraph line which a casual employe had failed to find at the Thirty-nine-mile peg. He was instructed by the postmaster at Bourke to go right through to Brewarrina, if necessary ; and when the work was done he, on the 27 th January, put in a fair claim for &#163;7, but he did not get paid until June. This is one case amongst others; and such delays ought not to be possible. In an official report the excuse is made that, when the man&#39;s voucher came down, it was not shown that he had been instructed by the postmaster to go through to Brewarrina, and it was referred back to him for details of each day&#39;s work. The man could not sit down in Bourke and wait for the money. He had gone away to look for work. The account was passed by the Electrical Engineer eventually, on the 27th. April, but it took another eight days in the Department in Sydney before it&#39; was approved. It was approved on 5th May, but the voucher was not sent to Bourke until 2nd June. I wish to call special attention to the view of the  Deputy  Postmaster- General of Sydney, who says - </para>

          <para>No unnecessary delay was caused, and there is little doubt had Curren not been absent from Bourke, and had furnished the necessary details earlier, payment could have been effected without delay. The voucher was forwarded to Bourke on 2nd June for payment. </para>

        <para class="block">After six months&#39; delay, the  Deputy  Postmaster-General calmly says that no unnecessary delay was caused, and that if this man, who had done his work well for the Department, had sat down in Bourke and waited for his money he would have got it. The PostmasterGeneral should rouse up the  Deputy  and the whole Department in Sydney, if it takes them so long to make provision for the payment of these small sums for outside work. If the officials had to wait as long for their salaries, they might take a different view of the matter. I have mentioned this case because other cases, although not quite so glaring, occur from time to time, and I suggested, a long time ago, that an arrangement should be made for prompt payment to be made on the spot by the local postmaster for these small jobs. The  Deputy  promised to act on that suggestion at the time. Bourke has a large post-office, with an experienced man in charge, and he could be trusted to make payments of that kind. I am assured by those who attend to the repairing of telegraph lines that if prompt payments were made., they could secure more efficient men for the jobs. Under the present arrangement, by which they have to wait for vouchers to be sent from Sydney, they have to get local men who are not so competent, because they can remain on the spot and wait for pay- ment. That sort of thing tells up into thousands of pounds spread over the Commonwealth. In this case, it took from the 27th January until 2nd June before the man got his money, and he might have waited still longer if I had not kept stirring up the Department in the meantime. I am sure the Postmaster-General does not approve of the delay that took place, and I hope he will do something to insure the adoption of a better system with regard to these casual jobs. The work is important, and it is essential that the best men should be got to carry it out. </para>

One would think that it must have been the result of an extraordinary pressure of work in the Sydney General Post Office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,</inline> the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, is a very courteous and industrious officer, and, I believe, there has been a great pressure of work of late. I can hardly conceive of such a delay being attributable to negligence. If the honorable member willi hand me the letter, I shall cause inquiry to be made at once, and inform him of theresult. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to call the attention of the Minister of External Affairs to a few passages in the Constitution, and to assure him that, if the States possess the power that they have exercised lately, to place an embargo on the products of other States, then there is no Federation, and all the money we have spent and the speeches we have made for the adoption of the Constitution have been absolutely useless. If the States have that power, we are simply as we were prior to Federation, a segregation of wrangling political nonentities. Section 51 of the Constitution provides that- </para>

            <para>- Of course, it is. There is no question that there is a potato ring in Melbourne, and a potato ring in Sydney. There is as much Irish blight in Victoria as in Tasmania. It is to be found in several parts of Victoria and New South Wales. Since it appeared in Ireland in 1846 and 1847, no part of the world where potatoes have been grown permanently and continuously has escaped the disease. Yet New South Wales and Victoria assert that the blight exists only in Tasmania. It exists in different parts of Australia, and there was never any intention of shutting out the Tasmanian potatoes until it suited the ring to do so. I am told that potatoes are now&#163;25 a ton in Western Australia, while they are from&#163;9 to &#163;10 a ton here. The poor people of Melbourne and Sydney are deprived of the opportunity of purchasing the Tasmanian red skins, and have to pay twice as much for spawns grown by Chinese on the mainland. The great States of Victoria and New South Wales are exercising an unconstitutional power to protect the Chinese growers of potatoes.

            <para>- It is high time that attention was called to the violation of the Constitution by the States of Victoria and New South Wales. If Ministers look to the United States, whence most of our Constitution was derived, they will find that no such thing as Victoria and New South Wales have done would be possible there. No State in America could, by a subterfuge, raise a barrier to shut out the products of other States. Surely it will be admitted that the State of Tasmania has suffered enough already. She suffers by reason of her separation from the mainland, and from the operations of a throttling shipping ring. Let me quote a letter which I have received to-day from a business man in Melbourne.

        <para>On 12th August I had landed in Melbourne 1,140 bags of potatoes. These were inspected and passed before shipment at Stanley, Tasmania. On arrival, in Melbourne on Thursday, 12th inst., the inspectors proceeded to reinspect in which work they took up the balance of the week, it being on the following Monday when I was notified that 835 bags were condemned. During this time the market collapsed, and I had to take fully  &#163;2  10s. per ton less than I would have received had the potatoes been inspected more expeditiously. This morning I was on the wharf and found two inspectors cutting open my potato sacks, and on inquiry I was told that they were looking for samples of Irish blight for their chief. I then emptied out on the wharf two bags out of a lot of 189, two bags out of a lot of 109, two bags out of a lot of go, and the inspector who condemned them and another who accompanied him failed to find one infected potato in the three lots examined, notwithstanding that they had lain on thewharf exposed to the weather for a fortnight. </para>

        <para class="block">This is a serious matter, not only for the farmers of Tasmania, but for the con sumers of Australia. It is a serious matter for the miners of Western Australia, and for the thousands of industrial workers of Melbourne and other cities, who are being deprived of these splendid potatoes, just because Ministers do not insist upon the law of the Commonwealth being paramount. They are allowing the States to exercise powers which they have no right to assume. A cruel wrong is being done to the Tasmanian farmers whose potatoes were landed on the wharfs in Melbourne long before the embargo was raised. They had the assurance that their potatoes would be allowed to be distributed. But the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has now shut them out. He has exercised powers which pertain to the Commonwealth only. I wish we had but one courageous Minister, who would throttle this secession movement, this flagrant violation of the Commonwealth Constitution. We are returning to the conditions that prevailed in the old days, when trade was thwarted by political nonentities. I only wish that for two days I could be Minister of External Affairs. This matter could be quickly ventilated, and a test case would soon settle it. We have certain powers under the Constitution and the Quarantine Act, but have not the courage to exercise them. But we should not sit ona stone wall like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Facing-both-ways,</inline> or be like the blank leaf between the Old and New Testaments, which belongs to neither dispensation. Sometimes I wonder whether Parliaments are not a mistake, and dictators the right thing. One may make out the best case in the world from every point of view, only to be told that there will be an inquiry, and that ends the matter. I am sure that the Minister wishes to obtain justice for the producers of Tasmania. That State joined the Federation without making any bargains, trusting that she would receive fair play.

This great farming country, whose people, I am sorry to say, are still a little Conservative, though there is hope for their salvation, is almost isolated. Before the last mail contract was signed, the <inline font-style="italic">Flora</inline> used to go into Stanley, I have been told on good authority that the Union Steam-ship Company has a controlling interest in the smaller lines of vessels which trade to that part of the Commonwealth, or an honorable understanding with their directors. The vessels of the line are good enough for river work, but too small for the trade between Tasmania and Melbourne. While the residents of our big cities have libraries, theatres, large churches with eloquent pastors, and splendid entertainments of various kinds to enliven their leisure, those in the country districts have none of these things, and it is not too much to ask that their means of communication be improved. I hope that the PostmasterGeneral will insist, in connexion with the next mail contract, that the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah</inline> shall go to Stanley at least once a week, either in coming from Burnie to Melbourne or on the return journey. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to direct attention to a matter affecting the administration of the old-age pensions law. From replies recently given to questions which I asked the Treasurer, I gather that the complaints which have reached me from my State have been caused by the difference between the property allowance under the State Act and that under the Commonwealth Act which has superseded it. There is no doubt that the Federal enactment confers a very great boon upon a large section of the community, especially in the States where oldage pensions are now being paid for the first time. In a matter of this kind, we should aim at achieving uniformity, and, in this connexion, it is worthy of note that the legislation enacted by the various States differed in several very important particulars. I extract the following from Knibb&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Year-book of Australia,</inline> in reference to New South Wales - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The pension is diminished by &#163;1 per annum for every &#163;1 of income above &#163;26 in the case of a separate pensioner, and for every &#163;1 above &#163;19 10s. in the case of husband and wife living together, and by &#163;1 for every&#163;15 of property owned by the pensioner in either case. In Victoria the pension is diminished by1s. per week for every shilling earned over 2s. per week, and by 6d. per week for every&#163;10 of property, other than furniture and personal effects to the value of&#163;25. In Queensland the pension is diminished by &#163;1 per annum for every complete pound of annual income above &#163;26, and also by &#163;1 per annum for every complete &#163;15 of net capital value of accumulated property. The maximum income that may be received, inclusive of pension, is, therefore, &#163;52 per annum in New South Wales and Queensland, and &#163;31 4s. per annum in Victoria, and the maximum amount of property that may be held is&#163;389 in New South Wales, &#163;159 in Victoria, and&#163;259 in Queensland. In Victoria possession of money above the amount of &#163;10 acts as a disqualification. </para>

        <para class="block">That passage shows that New South Wales treated her old-age pensioners very much more liberally than did the other States in the matter of their income, and of their accumulated property. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act passed by this Parliament provides for a deduction of  &#163;1  for every  &#163;10  of income in excess of  &#163;50.  whilst in New South Wales and Queensland the law formerly sanctioned a deduction of &#163;1 for every&#163;15 of income. The effect of Commonwealth legislation upon this subject is that a number of pensioners upon being transferred from State to Federal control have been notified of deductions in their pensions, and naturally they cannot understand the reasonwhy those deductions are made. It would be a graceful aet on the part of the Commonwealth to fall intoline with the more progressive States by diminishing the amount of old-age pensions by only&#163;1 for every  &#163;15  of property owned by the pensioner. In that way, a great deal of the existing  friction might be removed. Some time ago the Premier of Queensland intimated that if the Commonwealth did not reduce the residential qualification of applicants from twenty-five to twenty years, so as to bring its legislation into harmony, with that which obtained in Queensland, he would see that that State provided pensions in the case of claims disallowed by the Commonwealth. It will be seen, therefore, that he recognised the justice of those claims. The matter was also brought under the notice of the Premier of New South Wales, and his recommendation was that representations be made to the Federal authorities. The Commonwealth, I am glad to say, has reduced the age limit, tout, so far, it has not effected any change in the amount of the accumulated property which1 a pensioner may possess. I would strongly urge upon the Government the desirableness of effecting a levelling up in this matter. I do not know to what extent it would involve the Commonwealth in additional expenditure, &#39; but from correspondence which has reached me from my own electorate, I gather that a considerable number of deductions have been made. Under the State regulation, if the accumulated property happened to be a deposit of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> in a bank, the owner was allowed an exemption of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> and on the balance a reduction was made at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> for every <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15,</inline> or he &#34;was reduced by the amount of about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;$</inline> 6s. 8d. on the accumulated property. The interest drawn was, I understand, treated as capital. .1 am told that under the Commonwealth a different principle has been instituted, and that the deduction on account of a deposit of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> in a bank, allowing for an exemption of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50,</inline> amounts to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,</inline> and if <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> is received as interest, that is treated as income, so that on the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> there is. a deduction of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;8</inline> per annum as against the pension allowance. This is a matter of very serious moment to many persons. Again, in New South Wales, it was customary to pay pensions monthly, and to meet the position of applicants as far as possible. A number of applicants were so located that it was not very convenient for them to get to the paying office, but the  Department endeavoured to convenience them as far as possible, and, so far as I can gather, very little injustice was done. Under the Commonwealth, however, fortnightly payments are made. In some cases applicants would prefer to receive their payments monthly, because of the inconveniences which I have indicated. But another trouble has arisen. The payments are not made through every post-office, but only through post-offices which are authorized to issue money orders. The other day there was brought under mv notice a case in my electorate where the applicant resided 20 miles from the paying office, although there was a post-office in his near neighbourhood. He cannot draw his pay at the local postoffice, because it is not authorized to issue money orders, and he has to travel 20 miles fortnightly to&#39; the paying office. Not having any conveyance of his own, he is compelled to utilize the coach, &#39;which means a fare, and the coach so runs that it involves the passing of a night in the town. I do not see why there should be a hard-and-fast rule laid down that payments can only be made at. post-offices which are authorized to issue money orders. I think that any postoffice should have the power to act on behalf of the Commissioner, and to make these payments. The aim of the Department should be to make it as easy as they can for unfortunate people to draw their pensions. In that way a considerable amount of convenience could be afforded. The invalid section of the Old-age Pensions Act provides that in certain cases a pension may be paid to a person under sixtyfive, but over sixty, years of age. I am told that that section is administered in such a way that practically only those persons who are physically unfit and incapable of work to an extent  which a doctor can certify is permanent can secure the benefit of a pension. I do not think, that that was the intention of the Legislature. If, by reason of premature age or physical defects arising from age, any person is incapacitated from earning a living, that fact ought to be sufficient to enable him to qualifyunder the section. That was, I think, the intention. A more liberal interpretation might reasonably be given to the section, and by doing so a number of very deserving persons could be benefited. The other day I had a case brought under my notice where an aged lady was unable to earn a living because of rheumatism in her hands and arms, but because the doctor could not see his way to certify that she was physically incapable of earning a living, not only for the present, but for the rest of her life, apparently she is debarred from getting the benefit of the provision. I am told that the stringency of the administration is such that very few applications have been approved,  and very few are likely to be approved while such administration is continued. I submit that the intention of the Legislature is being frustrated, and the Government are doing a grave injustice to a large number of very deserving persons, who ought to receive fairer treatment at their hands. A few nights ago I brought under the Minister&#39;s attention the matter of the administration of his office in Sydney. I pointed out to him that, according to the information I received, the office was required to do considerable additional work, compared with what had to be done under State control. Many more applications have been put in, but no provision has been made to meet the extra demands upon the office, with the result that the officers are working overtime, and there is a danger of the Department getting into a chaotic state. The Treasurer promised to look into the matter and have it remedied. I shall be glad to know that he has done so, and that the increased staff which is necessary for the proper execution of the work will be provided at a very early date. I cannot conceive of anything more detrimental to the proper administration of this humanitarian legislation than to allow the administrative staff to get into a disorganized condition. I have no more to say on the matter, but I felt that I should not be doing justice to the aged people in the State from which I come if I did not bring their grievances before the House. </para>

              <para>- And, having insisted upon the Government bringing them on, nothing has been done. Is this not a piece of hypocritical pretence? Honorable members insist that these works should go forward, and when an effort is made to consider the Works Estimates, they will not touch them. I think it is time to expose this hypocritical pretence. Here we have been for two days discussing Works Estimates, and not a penny provided for in them has yet been passed. </para>

              <para>- Th-j honorable member knows that we adjourned when, at a very late hour, honorable members opposite told us that they, were going to put no more business through. We are again adjourning to-night, and there is still nothing done. In the meantime, public works, involving the expenditure ot  &#163;1,000,000,  are waiting to bo proceeded with. Honorable members opposite profess to be the special guardians of the working men, who are chiefly interested in the speedy passage of the Works Estimates, but the working men are being left outside to starve. </para>
