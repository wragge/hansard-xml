            <para>- I am aware that Rockhampton and other consignees north of Sydney, and in Sydney, have suffered1 inconvenience in connexion with the delay in discharging the cargo of theBerlin. Difficulty was caused in the first place by the Prize Court not permitting the cargo to be handled. Subsequently it was arranged to tranship the cargo into a vessel going as far north as Cairns. Still later it was determined by the consignees to have all the cargodischarged in Sydney, and the Customs Department has urged in all these cases as. speedy a discharge as possible. I received a telegram from the honorable member this morning in connexion with the matter, and immediately despatched* a telegram to Sydney to inquire whether the transportation of the cargo could not be hurried, so that those interested in itmight not have to suffer any longer delay than could be prevented. Every expedition has been used by the Customs Department in connexion with this, matter. </para>

The Department:has used every expedition in dealing with the cargo on the <inline font-style="italic">Berlin,</inline> as, indeed, it. has done in every case. I have sent a telegram to Sydney, and  if  I receive areply to-day I shall be pleased to let the honorable member have it. I would point out to him that it is quite possible that the Rockhampton portion  of  the:Berlin&#39;s cargo is stowed lower down the hold than is that intended for Sydneyand Brisbane, so that the latter cargo. - would necessarily have to be dealt with* first. </para>

            <para>- Will the Assistant Minister of Defence inquire as to the cost which the Department has incurred in respect of the equipment of our Expeditionary Forces, and compare the cost of the articles and commodities generally with which they have been supplied with the prices that were ruling before the war broke out? My point is that the Department has been compelled to pay excessive prices for the commodities purchased for these troops. Will the honorable gentleman make inquiries? </para>

            <para>- Although the general question raised by the honorable member relates to the Department of Defence, a prohibition of the export of mares can b&#169; issued only by the Department of Trade and Customs. We have prohibited the export of certain mares; but in some cases the consent of the Department to the export has been obtained. I do not think there will be any difficulty in the way of the men who bring their own mares into camp taking them with them abroad; but we have a right to prohibit the wholesale exportation of mares, since we desire to safeguard our own stock. </para>

He expressed the opinion, on behalf of his nation, that they would be very grateful for our assistance. I indicated that our idea would bethat the money should go through the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Government of Belgium, to be used by them as they thought best in healing the wounds their nation had suffered. </para>

          <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para>This measure, relating to trading with the enemy, is, in its very nature, confined in its operations to the duration of the war, and in clause 2 the period of its operation is expressly defined. Trading with the enemy has been, and is, illegal at common law, except under licence from the Crown, but the extent to which that goes is not quite clear. That contracts with an alien enemy are illegal, except by such licence, is well established, as is also the fact that the property employed in such trading can be confiscated. The liability of persons engaged in the trade is not without a doubt, but probably they may be prosecuted for a misdemeanour. The circumstances in which this Bill is brought before the House are that, immediately on the outbreak of war, the King issued a proclamation, dated 5th August, 1914, and published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> of 7th August, warning all persons in His Majesty&#39;s Dominion not to trade with the enemy, and defining the transactions so forbidden. Shortly afterwards the matter was put in statutory form. </para>
          <para>This is the first time such a thing has been done by the British Parliament - that is, the passing of an Act called the &#34;Trading with the Enemy Act.&#34; </para>

              <para>- No, I have not. The substance of it is embodied in thismeasure, but although we have had the substance, and practically the whole of the Act, cabled to us, we are not in possession of a copy of the measure. The main effect of the Act is to make trading with the enemy a statutory misdemeanour. So far as I know, it does not alter the liability of the individual, nor does it affect contracts. The law is here reduced to statutory form, and trading with the enemy is defined as including any act or transaction declared to be so by the King&#39;s proclamation. This present measure goes beyond the British Act, as it applies, not only to the proclamations by the King, but also to proclamations by the GovernorGeneral. This has been deemed necessary in order to cover Acts outside the scope of the British proclamation by virtue of our circumstances. </para>

          <para>I come now to the position as it is today. A second proclamation was issued on the 12th September, and subsequently a third proclamation, which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> on the 12th October. These proclamations prohibit trading with the enemy except as permitted by the proclamations. The Bill, which is a very short measure, is retrospective. It goes back to the 4th August in relation to acts between the subjects of the German Emperor and those of  His  Majesty the King of England and the Dominions, and to the 12th August in regard to acts between the subjects of the King of England and those of the Emperor of Austria King of Hungary. It provides for punishment by fine or imprisonment. Prosecutions are to be instituted by the Attorney-General only, either summarily or upon indictment, according to his view of the gravity of the offence. Goods may be confiscated. The Billapplies to corporations as well as to officers implicated, and these bodies are punishable. By clause 4, power is given to a magistrate, upon information from the ComptrollerGeneral of Customs, to issue a warrant to inspect books or documents, and search premises; while, in cases of urgency, the Comptroller-General may, by writing under his hand, authorize any person to carry out these functions without warrant. Clauses 5 and 6 are not in the Imperial Statute, but it has been thought necessary to insert them in this Bill. I propose to amend clause 5 by adding at the end the words &#39; &#39; or proceedings under this Act.&#34; This is a matter which can be discussed in Committee; but, seeing that the Bill is to apply to very special circumstances, I think it is desirable that evidence given in one proceeding shall not be excluded in subsequent proceedings. The individual is amply covered, so far as proceedings under the criminal law is concerned, in relation to evidence so given by him. Clauses 5 and 6 are similar to provisions now contained in our Industries Preservation Act. Clause 7 is worthy of note. It provides for the appointment of a controller of any business or company which is suspected of an offence, or which, being disorganized by the war, it is in the public interests should be carried on. </para>

            <para>.- I said last week that this was a measure we could pass without anything beyond a short discussion. I have been through the proclamations dealt with, and I think that the sum total of this measure is. to support proclamations issued before its enactment, and, as the Attorney-General has said, to enable others to be issued by the GovernorGeneral as well as in the name of the King. I believe that trading with the enemy is now prohibited by common law, and that was the view taken in Great Britain. I have read a good deal of the criticism on the Imperial measures recently introduced, though I have not read the Imperial Act upon this subject. It has not reached Australia; in fact, I am notquite sure that any Imperial Act has been passed dealing with trading with the enemy. An Alien Restriction Act has been passed dealing incidentally with trading.For instance, the measure enables aliens to reside in Great Britain, and it allows certain aliens to trade who have obtained licences for the purpose. I think that specially applies to banks. Before banking can be carried on by an alien a licence must be taken out. The general principle, however, is that aliens resident in the country have ample power to carry on trade within the country as ordinary citizens. There is a good deal of misapprehension as to the position of aliens who do business within the Commonwealth. I take it that the rule on the point is that, even though they have not taken out licences to trade, they can carry on their ordinary business operations so longas these do not extend beyond the Commonwealth, or so long as they are not trading with the enemy. This Bill is really a measure in connexion with the pro clamations on trade that have been, or may be, issued ; and the trading prohibited by it is trading of a class defined in the proclamations. </para>

              <para>- There are two or three proclamations. The principal proclamation was that of the 9th September, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> on the 12th September. I refer to proclamation (Trading with the Enemy) No. 2. I saw a press reference to the Imperial proclamation at the time and compared it with our proclamation. In some respects the two are dissimilar. I do not think the Imperial proclamation defines trading as including interchange of coin and various things of that class. On the other hand, our proclamation does this. Opinions have been offered in Great Britain to the effect that trading with the enemy does not Include the payment of coin, and that in some cases it does not extend to payments by cheque. Of course, there may be a payment in connexion with a new contract, but as a new contract itself is prevented that trading would be bad. </para>

              <para>- Yes; and incidentally any payment made in respect of it would be bad. Our proclamation expressly mentions some things which, if the London press synopsis is correct, are not specified in the Imperial proclamation. I mention these particulars now, because there has been a good deal of discussion in Great Britain in the pages of the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> and some other journals directly connected with trade as to the effect of the proclamation. In the <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline> of the 22nd August it is claimed that the specific mention of certain things in the proclamation gives ample assent to trading which is not specified. </para>

              <para>- I think that it is not of much consequence whether we issue these trading proclamations or not, because trade with about 300,000,000 of people, and trade from Germany and Austria to the countries with which they are at war amounting to &#163;240,000,000, including trade amounting to &#163;107,000,000 from Germany and Austria to the United Kingdom and the British Empire, is cut off. That trade being stopped, there is not much to be gained by issuing proclamations making it an offence to trade. It is a fact that all countries have been affected by the interruption of the trade relations of the countries at war. Some of the penalties are, to my mind, rather severe. </para>

              <para>- I refer to the penalties provided for in clause 3. A person summarily convicted before two justices of the peace, or a special magistrate, of the offence of trading with the enemy may be fined a sum not exceeding &#163;500, or be imprisoned for a term not exceeding twelve months, or both. The offence may be a trivial one. In the Crimes Bill the penalty to be imposed on conviction by a Court of summary jurisdiction is much less. </para>

              <para>- Large transactions would be dealt with by way of indictment or information, and the case would be tried before a jury.

            <para>By the law and Constitution of Great Britain the Sovereign alone has the power of declaring war and peace. He alone, therefore, who has the power of entirely removing the state of war, has the power of removing it in part, by permitting, where he sees proper, that commercial intercourse which is a partial suspension of the war. There may be occasions on which such an intercourse may be highly expedient; but it is not for individuals to determine on the expediency of such occasions, on their own notions of commerce merely, and possibly on grounds of private advantage, not very reconcilable with the general interests of the State. It is for the State alone, on more enlarged views of policy, and of all the circumstances that may be connected with such an intercourse, to determine when it shall be permitted, and under what regulations. No principle ought to be held more sacred than that this intercourse cannot subsist on any other footing than that of the direct permission of the State. </para>

No doubt certain proclamations might conflict with the rights of the Sovereign, but the proposal before the Committee is of quite another kind. It was framed to suit the circumstances in which we in this country find ourselves. I think it very desirable that the Commonwealth should have power to issue a proclamation to deal with special circumstances arising here. There are other reasons for the provisionson which I need not dwell ; but I have explained shortly to the Leader of the Opposition why we should have this power. </para>

Some of the newspapers, I think, called attention to the explanation given by the Imperial Government which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of 22nd August last; and I may, perhaps, clear up some of the points to which the honorable member for Maribyrnong has drawn attention if I refer to a paragraph or two in that published explanation. It is stated that - . </para>

              <para>- Quite so. I think the proclamation says that, in effect. We have to come back to the&#39; question as to whether the goods have become part of the mass of goods in the country ; the question of whether or not their origin has been German is irrelevant. If the transaction were not complete, but would be completed by the branch, it would, generally speaking, be invalid. </para>

              <para>- I have endeavoured to reconcile the two things by_ saying that if the transactions here with the enemy country were incomplete, and were to be completed through the branch itself, that would be invalid as against our proclamation ; but, if the goods were here, in possession of the branch, and were part of the general mass of goods in the community, their sale by a branch of a foreign firm would not be &#39; &#39; trading with an enemy &#39; &#39; under the proclamation. I suppose the position would be the same at common law. </para>

            <para>.- It would seem, from the explanations giver* to the Committee, that, under the Bill as it stands, a German firm might, by means of an agency in neutral territory, carry on as much trade as it desired with these States. There seems to be no effective barrier in the way. I understand that our trade and commerce law does not require all goods imported to be stamped so as to show the country of origin, and I should like to know how we are toprevent Australia sending away rivetsfor German guns in the shape of coin of the realm. Is the whole matter to be left to the international code of laws, or can we not provide more effectively than does this Bill against trading with an enemy? </para>

It is obviously undesirable to state too precisely what one thinks ought to be done, since the mere statement of it might prevent our doing what we considered desirable. But what this Bill gives this Commonwealth power to do is to issue a proclamation that may deal with the mattertouched upon by the honorable member;. and that is all we want. I have given notice this afternoon of my intention to move for leave to introduce another measure which will still further strengthen the hands of the Commonwealth in dealing with goods which may conceivably be outside the scope of this measure. </para>

            <para>.- This being a war Bill, which will expire with the war, one cannot press one&#39;s opposition to the imposition of these heavy penalties. I wish to point out, however, that some comparatively trivial charges may be preferred under the Bill, and that an ordinary justice of the peace will have power to impose these very heavy penalties. There has been exhibited, from time to time, a disinclination to vest justices of the peace with very wide powers. This is due, not to any desire to impute to them want of ability, but to the fact that there are so many justices of the peace that very great disparity sometimes occurs in the amount of penalties imposed by them. Under the Crimes Bill a justice of the peace cannot impose a penalty exceeding &#163;100; but, under this amendment, a justice of the peace will have the power to impose a maximum penalty of &#163;500. I do not wish, however, to press the matter. </para>

          <para>This is a Bill to amend the Judiciary Act 1903-12. Under section 76 of the Constitution, it is provided that Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. That jurisdiction has not yet been conferred. II is now proposed, by this Bill, to confer it. This will place the High Court of Australia in the same position as the High Court of England. The jurisdiction conferred will be  exercised  in two distinctly different ways - first, in regard to actions for salvage, towage, collisions, damages, wages, and so forth; and, secondly, in relation to prize. Admiralty jurisdiction generally is possessed at the present time by the various State Supreme Courts; and the jurisdiction which it is proposed to confer on the High Court in regard to such matters as salvage, towage, collision, &#38;c, will be concurrent with that exercised by the State Courts. In regard to prize jurisdiction, the position is somewhat different. The Colonial Courts have jurisdiction in matters of prize, but they cannot exercise it unless specially authorized by His Majesty. These Courts are not Colonial, but Imperial; and the old practice was for the King to commission Prize Courts after the outbreak of war. But an Act of the British Parliament in 1894 provided that Prize Courts in the Possessions might be commissioned in times of peace, though they could not exercise the jurisdiction until the issue of a proclamation in time of war. In 1899, I think, a Commission was issued to the Lords of the Admiralty, who, in turn, conferred this jurisdiction on the various Supreme Courts of the States. This was, of course, dormant until revived by the issue of a proclamation by the &#34;ViceAdmiral of the Commonwealth; and the jurisdiction has been exercised by the six State Courts since that proclamation was issued. </para>

              <para>- It is not proposed to interfere with the concurrent jurisdiction in maritime matters generally, but in regard to prize jurisdiction I wish to put my views before the House. At the outbreak of the war there were six Prize Courts in Australia; and those six, or such of them as have had occasion to exercise the jurisdiction, exercised it at their own discretion, and delivered judgments on lines they conceived to be- in harmony with what is termed international law, and not always with satisfaction and convenience to the Commonwealth. It is obviously undesirable that there shoul&#39;d be six Courts exercising jurisdiction in a matter of this sort, with out provision for uniformity of some kind. The decisions given have been, in. many cases, conflicting; in one case, at any rate, no workable decision was given, nor has yet been given, so far as I know. These matters clearly come within the scope of the Commonwealth, intimately concerning, as they do, both the Defence Department and the Department of Trade and Customs, which have to primarily move in this regard. Under the circumstances, it is most desirable that the Commonwealth should be vested with the necessary jurisdiction.&#39;. The Bill does not create Prize Courts, but merely confers maritime and admiralty jurisdiction on the High Court; and it is proposed to request the Home authorities to vest prize jurisdiction in that Court. At the same time, it is proposed to make representations that there is not sufficient reason for the retention of prize jurisdiction by the State Courts; and the reason for this is, I think, perfectly clear. Maritime jurisdiction generally, in regard to salvage, towage, wages, collisions, and so on, will remain concurrent and exercisable by the States and the Commonwealth. With regard to prize jurisdiction, it is, as I say, intended to represent to the Admiralty that there are not sufficient reasons for retaining the concurrent jurisdiction of the States. This Bill is one which the experience of both Governments, since the outbreak of t;he war, has shown to be necessary. </para>

            <para>.- This is a Bill that ought to pass without much discussion. I understand that the measure accomplishes two things, one of which is to give the High Court, under the Constitution, maritime and admiralty jurisdiction, but it does not define what that jurisdiction amounts to. Whatever that jurisdiction is - though the High Court has given it, probably rightly, a narrower interpretation than is given in America - it is conferred by the Bill. As to Prize Courts, I confess that in reading the Bil) I was somewhat puzzled as to what was to be the position of the Supreme Courts of the States who have exercised this jurisdiction. Some of these are Prize Courts, under an Act of 1890, the title of which I forget, but under which these Courts are proclaimed Admiralty Courts. Now, it is proposed by this - Bill to make the High Court a Court in prize matters. I do not know what its real relation to the State Courts will be.It is assumed that there will be an appeal from their decisions. I think the Attorney-General assumes that there will be an appeal to the High Court. </para>

              <para>- There is that appeal, and, notwithstanding that their jurisdiction comes from the Act of 1890, if they are State Courts as well as Vice-Admiralty Courts there will be an appeal to the High Court, because that appeal is preserved by the Constitution in every case in which there was the right of appeal from the State Courts to the Privy Council at the time when the Constitution name into force. </para>

              <para>- I do not think it will apply. I do not think they are State Courts for the purposes of appeal. The matter was discussed by <inline font-style="italic">Keith</inline> in his work on responsible government in relation to Canada, and, referring to Australia, he mentioned the Courts of Victoria and New South Wales, and expressed the opinion that they would not be State Courts. They have their jurisdiction from an earlier Act, or from patents issued earlier than the Act of 1890. Their jurisdiction was independent of that Act. A doubt may exist as to whether such jurisdiction is subject to appeal to the High Court. If the Attorney-General will get the Imperial Government to have all prize matters dealt with by the High Court, with power to appoint the Supreme Courts to help in the matter, I think the end a very desirable object to be accomplished. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>Though this measure comes before the Chamber for the first time, it is by no means a stranger to very many of us. It is one of those measures which, though urgently necessary and without a blot upon their escutcheons, are ruthlessly swept aside by every party from time to time. We on this side have done it, and I have no doubt that if we were down to bedrock we would do it again. The Bill deals with offences against the Commonwealth, but does not apply to offences against individuals; that is a fact to be noted at the outset. The present position of the Commonwealth in regard to offences committed against any law of the Commonwealth is anomalous and unsatisfactory. In some cases the Commonwealth legislation creates offences and provides penalties, but for the greater part of the Commonwealth&#39;s sphere of legislation the Commonwealth has to have recourse to State Courts. The State Courts, in their turn, deal with offences under the common law and statutory law, and with offences against the Commonwealth for which there is no statutory sanction in any State Acts, as it has been held that the Commonwealth cannot have recourse to the common law, it follows that in every case where an offence committed against the Commonwealth is not dealt with under any State Statute the proceedings by the Commonwealth in respect to that offence stop short at committal. The Commonwealth may deal with the matter up to the point when the offender is committed for trial, but beyond that it has no status at all. Obviously, that is a most undesirable state of affairs, and it affected the Commonwealth very materially in several important prosecutions quite recently, notably Customs frauds and frauds against the Maternity Allowance Act. Control by the Commonwealth is very desirable. Certainly, lack of control is most undesirable, and it further involves additional expense which, in the aggregate, is very considerable. The Bill makes offences against the Commonwealth offences against the law of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, justiciable in the Commonwealth Courts. For instance, as we now have full control of coinage, it follows that offences against the Commonwealth law will include coining, and offences of a cognate character. The Bill will also deal with forgery - forgery, of course, of any Commonwealth instrument or power, not forgery of the signature of an individual, but the forgery of the signature of a High Court Justice, or any authority whose signature is necessary for giving effect to some instrumentality or power of the Commonwealth. One effect of the Bill will be to harmonize, throughout Australia, all procedure in regard to offences against the Commonwealth. At present, it often occurs that proceedings begun in one State in regard to an offence produce a totally different result from proceedings begun in another State in regard to the same offence. This occurs because the laws in each State are different, and is a most undesirable thing. The defect is remedied by the Bill. Uniform methods of procedure will replace the divergent State methods, and there will be uniform penalties. The measure does not, except in very few cases, create new offences. It must not be regarded as a new Criminal Code, nor does it make punishment more drastic. All the Bill does is to give the Commonwealth power to deal with offences against itself, or in relation to those powers which it exercises. In a few words, I may give the genealogy of the measure. I shall not be so forgetful of what I owe to myself, and to my friends opposite, as to say anything about its more recent adventures. The measure is based on the Queensland Criminal Code of 1889, which was drafted by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, the present Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, and was based on the English draft Code of 1880. This English Code was drawn up by a Royal Commission ap pointed in 1878, comprising Lord Blackburn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lush, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Fitz james Stephen. These very celebrated jurists furnished the model on which the English Code was drafted. The Canadian Code, and also Pennefather&#39;s  draft Code of South Australia, have also been looked at in connexion with the drafting of this Bill, and several very important principles have been taken from them. It is most important to remember that, except in regard to espionage and offences against the Commonwealth, such as copying plans of fortresses, and obtaining military secrets, and such offences against the vital interests of the nation, the measure before us creates no new offences, if, indeed, it creates offences of that kind; because, in one way or another, they are nearly all covered by State law or common law. The Bill is divided into eight parts. Part I. deals with procedure, principles of criminal liability, and general matters. It gives power to the Court to declare persons habitual criminals. It gives power to inflict cumulative and concurrent sentences, and it enables prisoners to be released on licence. It also gives power to issue search warrants. Part II. deals with offences against the Government, such as treason, sedition, destruction or damage of Commonwealth property. Part III. deals with offences relating to the administration of justice, such as judicial and official corruption. Offences relating to coinage, dealt with in Part IV., have relation to foreign coinage as well as Australian coinage. By Part V., forgery is limited to the forgery of official seals, signatures, documents, and papers. Heavy penalties are provided for these things. Offences by and against public officers &#34;are dealt with at length in Part VI. Part VII., which applies to a breach of official secrecy, is based on the Imperial Official Secrets Act of 1911 relating to espionage. The matters dealt with are unlawful spying, communicating or receiving secret information with regard to the defences and harbors of Australia, the harboring of spies, and the taking of unlawful soundings. Persons suspected of espionage may be arrested without warrant. Prosecutions under this part of the Bill require the consent of the Attorney-General. Part VIII. covers a number of miscellaneous offences, including conspiracy, and the buying and selling of public offices. The Bill is a fairly lengthy one. Some matters that were formerly included in it have been excised; but I think it sufficiently covers the ground. The measure should long ago have been introduced, and 1 apologize for this, and all other Governments that have gone before us, for the fact that it has not been introduced earlier; but it is especially necessary at the present juncture, because, right throughout the British Dominions, the law in regard to espionage may be designated as shamefully lax. I suppose the British people are the most trustful on earth, but there comes a point where trust and confidence in one&#39;s fellow man becomes almost a crime. Certainly, some measure of this kind, conferring powers on the Commonwealth to protect its military and naval secrets, and to deal with spies, and those who make a profession of obtaining information of value to their respective Governments for the purpose of presently, or later, inflicting harm upon the Commonwealth, is obviously necessary at the present time; and this Bill will confer those powers. I. shall not deal at any greater length with the measure, but I shall be very glad to supply information to honorable members as and when they may require it with regard to its various provisions. So far as I know this measure cannot be regarded as a penal code in the sense that it creates new crimes, excepting those crimes that have relation to espionage,; and the obtaining of information with regard to our naval or military secrets, fortresses, harbors, and so on. It is not to be regarded as imposing additional provisions with regard to ordinary offences and crimes - such as forgery, perjury, coining, and so on. With regard to the corruption of the Judiciary and of public officers, I shall not say that under this measure the public might not have greater opportunities for the punishment of such offences. I hardly think it will be so, because I believe that under the -common law and statutory law now in force, every offence, excepting those dealing with espionage and the like, is already covered. The object of the Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to exercise jurisdiction, and to have power in respect of offences against itself and the various laws made under the Constitution. The necessity for uniformity in the matter is obvious. The delay in the prosecution of offences under existing circumstances is considerable, and the expense is a very material item. </para>

            <para>.- The Attorney-General has said that this is a Bill of many sources, and, I might say, of multiple parentage. I think that in 1909, in his policy speech delivered at Ballarat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> foreshadowed the introduction of a Bill of this kind. The measure must have been added to recently, as. I have never previously seen a draft of it so longas that now before us. </para>

              <para>- I know that such a measure was publicly referred to during a previous election campaign. There have been some additions made to the previous draft which, I think, are questionable, and to which reference can be more properly made in Committee. I find, for instance, the old offence - which is almost as old as Magna Charta - about insisting upon excessive bail, is under this measure made a statutory offence. No such provision, I think, exists in any of the States, with the exception of Queensland, and the marginal note to the clause in this Bill dealing with the matter shows that it is taken from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith&#39;s criminal code of 1889 or 1890. The main object of the Bill, I take to be, to cover the defect that in some cases we have no jurisdiction to prosecute at common law. For instance, there is the case mentioned with regard to the Maternity Allowance Act. We can, under that Act, prosecute an individual for fraud; but, where there is a conspiracy to defraud under the Act, there is a doubt whether an indictment will lie. An offence which may be the subject of a common law prosecution in the State Courts, because it is an offence against a State law, is made a statutory offence here by the Bill. That appears to me to be the main object of the measure; but there are certain other offences introduced which might be better considered in Committee than at this stage. On the whole, the Bill is one on which very few words need be said on the second reading. </para>

            <para>.- This Bill was under consideration, I think, as far back as 1907. I think that very properly it is, to a very great extent, based upon the criminal code drafted by the present Chief Justice of the High Court when he was Chief Justice of Queensland. I have not had time to go through the measure very carefully, but I have noticed one or two instances of departures from the phrasing of the Queensland criminal code. I need only say that the Queensland criminal code is really a monumental work, which will stand to the everlasting credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith as a parliamentary draftsman and a jurist. The experience of those who have worked under that code in the Courts of Law is that the drafting has been very carefully done, and, on the &#34;whole, has proved to be excellent. I mention this to the AttorneyGeneral because I presume he has carefully considered the deviations in this measure from the original draft, and will be able to give some justification for the departures to which I refer. The honorable gentleman will admit that, when a Statute is shown to have worked well, it is a dangerous thing to depart from its phraseology. The deviations from the Queensland Criminal Code may be mentioned when we get to the Committee stage of the Bill. </para>

There is a power of condemnation given to the AttorneyGeneral such as under the Customs Act is vested in the Minister of Trade and Customs or the Collector of Customs.

            <para>.- In clause 13 it is provided that information may be laid and prosecutions commenced by any person. Some of the offences dealt with here are comparative novelties, and in one or two instances the power of any person to prosecute is cut down. In some cases, but not in this part, the Attorney- General must first give his consent. I hope that too much power to commence prosecutions will not be given to individuals, especially in regard to offences that are new. Another point to which I draw attention is this: In some of the States notwithstanding the limitations imposed upon the Courts of summary jurisdiction, there are cases in which, on the person charged exercising his option to be tried before those Courts instead of being committed for trial, he may, if the circumstances allow, receive a severer punishment than it is ordinarily within the power of such Courts to inflict. In South Australia that is provided for by -what is known as the Minor Offences Act. I do not know whether the Bill preserves this arrangement. In some of the States magistrates may not imprison for a longer period than six months, but, if at a preliminary inquiry-before a magistrate an offender exercises his option to be tried at once, imprisonment of two or three years may be inflicted on him. </para>

The provision is taken from the Queensland code, and I do not think appears in the jurisprudence of the other States. Generally the maximum penalty is a large one, and Judges inflict a heavy penalty for a second offence. </para>

            <para>.- The clause opens up a rather vexed question, which I shall not delay the measure by discussing. In some States the principle of indeterminate sentences has been applied, though not to any great extent, but there has been a good deal of debate as to its efficacy. We are now adopting it without discussion. I hope that the AttorneyGeneral has some information as to its desirability. </para>

I admit that arguments may be advanced against it, but the penologists and criminologists are in agreement that the power to impose indeterminate sentences is necessary to deal with the habitual criminal. </para>

            <para>.- This provision seems somewhat anomalous. It provides&#39; that any person who, by violence or threats or intimidation, interferes with the free exercise by any other person of any political right or duty shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable to a term of imprisonment. Under the State law a person cannot be charged with preventing a man from discharging his political duties, although if he molests him in any way he becomes liable for assault, and, apart from molestation, may be liable for damages. But the political aspect of the matter is not covered by the ordinary State laws. In this clause we have a codification of the Queensland law which was enacted in 1889, and portions of that law were pretty old-fashioned even then. </para>

Clause 50 of the Bill is apparently designed to deal with such cases as that of the seizure of property by the New South Wales Government. Beading through the Bill, I have come to the conclusion that in some cases the abettor is to be visited with a bigger penalty than is the principal offender.

            <para>.- I see it is noted that this clause has also been taken from the Queensland Act. It is a pretty wide provision, and I hope that it has been considered. &#34;A Commonwealth officer.&#34; I take it, includes a Minister. There is a penalty up to two years&#39; imprisonment imposed upon any one whose duty it is to keep a secret, and who does not do so. I suppose that the same penalty will apply to both sexes. If a Minister should disclose the contents of some official document, I suppose it will come within the meaning of the provision. The safeguard, I think, is that the AttorneyGeneral will have to consent to a prosecution under this part of the Bill. I am not sure, but I think that that is so. </para>

              <para>- I hope it is so. This means that such an indefinite thing as not keeping an official secret will subject the person who commits the offence to a penalty up to two years&#39; imprisonment. The provision is somewhat novel. It appears in the Queensland Act, but I do not know where else it does appear. My impression is that you must be explicit as to what has to be kept secret. I do not think it will cover the disclosure of a document marked &#34; Confidential &#34; as between a Minister and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, because there is no imperative duty to any one there. </para>

We aTe going to have an amendment of the Tariff, which will help us considerably; but a great deal more can be done in many ways to 0 give a fillip to Australian industries. I trust the Government will take the lead in the matter, even if they go to the length of calling men who are worth consulting throughout the Commonwealth into conference, in order that a strong campaign may be instituted in favour of promoting Australian industries. We should endeavour, not only to regulate, organize, and consolidate those already in existence, but also to do everything possible to establish new ones. When the war cloud lifts, which we hope will not be long, I trust Australia will be so organized industrially, commercially, and in a trading sense, that we shall be able to take full advantage of the opportunities that must accrue as a consequence of the war. I hope that every phase of commercial and business life, as well as the employes, will be represented in the conference that I suggest, in order that some organization may be formed with this national object in view, so that we may be able, when the war is over, to take our stand among the nations of the world in supplying those things for the manufacture of which we have millions of pounds&#39; worth of raw material in this country. </para>

            <para>. - Will the Prime Minister bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the matter of the mutilation of shade trees in the streets of various cities? This is a question of some moment to a good many cities in Australia. At Toowoomba, in particular, some beautiful trees, which form part of a scheme that has been fostered for years to improve the appearance of the city, have been injured. The Department should devise some method to minimize the mutilation of shade trees. </para>

              <para>- Yes. We have recently had visits from town-planning experts who have been preaching the beautification of our cities, and it seems a pity that something cannot be done in the direction I have mentioned. These trees take years to grow, and it seems rather drastic to mutilate them for the sake of getting the poles and wires along. Probably a little care and thought might have devised a method of providing the telephonic facilities, which are absolutely necessary for the people, and at the same time preserving the beauty of the trees. </para>

            <para>. - I quite agree with the honorable member. We Australians are more or less an artistic people, and the shade trees have a value of their own, apart altogether from the artistic view point. I shall be glad to again invite the attention of the Postmaster-General and of the Public Works authorities to the matter, so that the mutilation of the beauty spots in the way of trees may be, as far as possible, avoided. One way to do it would be to underground most of our wires; but that is a grave matter of policy. </para>

              <para>- As the right honorable member and the honorable member for Darling Downs have been about twice as long in office as I have, I can hardly be accused of being the cause of this trouble; but I quite agree with their ideas on the subject. </para>

          <para>I am entirely with the honorable member for Maribyrnong regarding the question of organizing industries. Indeed, I go much further; but I find that there is a constitutional difficulty more or less embarrassing from our point of view. The Government have, however, with a view of attaining the object that the honorable member has put forward, asked the representatives of the States to come to Melbourne in about a fortnight or more, to consider all these matters, together with others, with a view of endeavouring to arrive at an understanding or agreement which will enable us to proceed with any such enterprises, and so help to prevent unemployment at the present time, whilst at the same time developing national industries, which will place Australia, even in times of peace, in a safer position than she occupies to-day. I cannot go any further than that. Something like seven years ago this House unanimously carried a motion in favour of the nationalization of the iron industry; yet to-day we are no further for ward in that respect than we then were. I believe that a vast number of the people of Australia are in favour of such an essential commodity as iron being manufactured in Australia in at least sufficient quantities to meet our own requirements. If we can come to an arrangement that will enable us to proceed with the work, it will be well for the country. </para>
