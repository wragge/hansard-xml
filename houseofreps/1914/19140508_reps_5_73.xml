I have turned up the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the speech of the honorable member for Barrier, and I find that the remarks which he has attributed to me, and which one or two other honorable members have repeated, are these: - </para>

            <para>- My reply is, in the first instance, that never at any time during the recess did I make a speech of any sort at Murwillumbah. I do not know from which of my various utterances in the electorate this passage is supposed to have been culled, but never at any time did I make the statement it contains, in the terms that are used. What I have said was that the Cook Ministry took office in very difficult circumstances, their opponents threatening from the housetops thatthey would not, on any consideration, allow the legislation of the Liberal party to go through the Senate. I said also, that if, under those circumstances, the Liberal party found that they could not translate to the statute-book the policy on which they had appealed to the electors, and were returned to power, they would take the earliest opportunity to appeal again to the country. I pointed out that when the &#34;Upper Chamber, which is not elected on the same democratic basis as the Lower House, sets itself to deliberately obstruct the will of the people as expressed by their representatives in the Lower House, means are provided in the Constitution of sending the Upper Chamber to its masters in the country. I added that I believed it to be the intention of this Government, if the policy of the Senate was persisted in, to attempt to obtain a double dissolution, but that, although I considered that to be the duty of the Ministry, under no circumstances could they insure the granting of a double dissolution, because that was the responsibility of the GovernorGeneral, and of him alone. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney is under a misapprehension in thinking that the erection of this building is under the control of the Department of Home Affairs. Certainly the foundation stone was laid before the old building was down during the late elections by a member of the then Government, but the work of erecting the new building is in the hands of the Bank itself. I understand that the builders have gone so far as to take out the foundations. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has already intimated that he does not propose to answer further questions without notice. I must again insist that when I call for order all noise and interruptions must at once cease. I shall be very loath to put another standing order into operation, but frequent appeals apparently fall on deaf ears, so far as some honorable members are concerned, and they will force me to have recourse very unwillingly to another standing order if they persist in disregarding the authority of the Chair. I do not propose to wear out my throat in calling for order. I give honorable members this timely warning. </para>

              <para>- It has been distinctly laid down that, when Ministers have intimated that they do not propose to answer questions without notice, it is only wasting the time of the House for questions without notice to be persisted in. With regard to the other point that has been raised, it is also laid down that it is in the discretion of Ministers to answer questions or not as they think fit. I would remind the Prime Minister that, having intimated that he did not propose to answer questions without notice, it puts the  Speaker  in an awkward position if he intimates, as the honorable member for Wannon has stated, that he is willing to answer a question which one honorable member may ask to the exclusion of others. </para>

              <para>- I rise to a point of order. I desire this matter cleared up, because it is of importance to honorable members. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> have ruled that, if a Minister has said that he will not answer a certain question, no member can ask that question. I maintain that honorable members can ask questions, but it is within the discretion of Ministers themselves to say whether they will answer them or not. It would be a most injudicious thing for this House to decide, that, merely because the Prime Minister said that he and other Ministers would not answer certain questions, honorable members should not be allowed to ask them. If a Minister decides not to answer questions he has a perfect right to decline, but surely, because a Minister declines to answer a question, that is not sufficient reason for preventing other honorable members from asking questions that may be vital to them and their constituents. </para>

              <para>- In reply to the question just asked by the honorable member for Maribyrnong, it is true that I pointed out - and all parliamentary authorities agree - that it is in the discretion of Ministers themselves to say whether they will answer questions or not ; and it is also laid down that if Ministers have intimated that it is not their intention to answer questions, persistence in asking such questions can only be a waste of time of the House. Apart from all the authorities on the subject, obviously there can be no purpose served, other than to obstruct business, by persistently asking questions without notice, when Ministers have intimated that they will not answer them. Such questions cannot elicit the information they seek, and therefore to persist in asking questions under those circumstances would be clearly nothing but a waste of the time of the House. And so it is laid down in the parliamentary authorities I have before me. </para>

How far is that kind of thing to go, because that is just as effective a way of occupying the time of Parliament as any other? I submit that the honorable member who put the last question was undoubtedly out of order, inasmuch as the same Question had been previously addressed to you half-a-dozen times this morning. </para>

              <para>- I would point out that the position is entirely within the control of Ministers themselves. If they do nob desire to answer questions without notice, then such questions can no longer be asked without notice. So that they have it in their own power to regulate the time that may be consumed in the asking of questions without notice. In regard to questions generally, there is no obligation under the Standing Orders on Ministers to answer them if they do not desire to do so. As to the time consumed since the Prime Minister intimated that it was not the intention of the Government to answer questions without notice, I would remind the Prime Minister that several points of order have arisen, and in that way the honorable member himself has taken up some portion of that time, and, to that extent, has been a contributor to the consumption of time. </para>

              <para>- Of course they are, and so is the honorable member. I wish at the outset to remove from the minds of honorable members any idea that this motion has been submitted merely with a desire to occupy the time of the House. It involves the consideration of one of the most important questions that could&#39; be discussed. During the censure debate, the attention of honorable members was concentrated practically upon one specific matter, and I decided, therefore, to await another opportunity to deal with this subject. We have heard a great deal in regard to electoral reform and the purification of the rolls. The Prime Minister has said that he does not intend to make an appeal to the people until the rolls have been cleansed. My desire is to indicate what is being done under the guise of purifying the rolls, and to show how far the Government have gone. In the first place, there appear on the Commonwealth roll hundreds of names which long since should have been removed. For this the whole Department is responsible. It is useless for the Minister to say, &#34; Surely you are not going to blame the officers of the Department.&#34; The blame must be located, and the head of the Department, whether it be the Minister or his leading officer, is charged with the responsibility of formulating a scheme that will enable the rolls to be purified. The result of the Department&#39;s efforts in this direction, however, is that there are on the rolls in some cases the names of people who have been absent from the particular electorates in question for ten or twelve years. It is remarkable that the Department has not in force some system which would enable it to discover such cases. Owing, chiefly, I take it, to the activity of the Liberal organizers, the roll for my own electorate has been so closely scrutinized that some 4,000 objections have been lodged. </para>

              <para>- I have not seen them all, and therefore cannot say ; but I shall quote a case to show how far they may or may not be genuine. Prior to the last State election, a Liberal organizer in my electorate was very active in his scrutiny of the State roll, and lodged nearly 300 objections. Under the State law, those objections had to come before a Revision Court, and some men who felt that there might be something wrong in connexion with them employed a solicitor to appear before the Court to test their legitimacy. He did so, and after the Liberal organizer had failed to substantiate some forty-eight or fifty objections this solicitor urged that in all future cases the penalty for which the law provided in respect of frivolous or unfounded objections should be imposed. The magistrate imposed a penalty in the next two cases in which the objections failed, and the organizer, finding that he would have to pay the penalty for lodging objections which he could not maintain, withdrew the remainder, and the names were allowed to remain on the roll. I do not say that there were not some duplications which he was justified in attempting to rectify. Duplications must inevitably occur, but only a very small number of the objections related to such cases. In some instances objection was taken to the appearance on the roll of the names of men who had not left the district for many years. One striking case was that of a constable and his wife, who, to my knowledge, had been in the district for thirteen or fourteen years. The constable had never been away, and yet this Liberal organizer sought to remove his name and that of his wife. </para>

              <para>- Had no one appeared on the other side to test the legitimacy of these objections they would unquestionably have been allowed. In a number of cases objection was taken to the names of people who were still in the district, and those names would have been removed from the roll if the other side had not gone to the expense of employing a solicitor to appear before the Court. I ask the Honorary Minister in charge of this Department, who does not seem to be interested in this matter, or, indeed, anything else just now- </para>

              <para>- I cannot say; but names that are wrongly on the rolls ought to be&#39; objected to, whether they represent Liberal or Labour voters. I am just as strongly in favour of a clean roll as is the Prime Minister or any one else, and think it a scandal that we have not had, before now, something more closely approximating to a pure roll. Permanent Divisional Returning Officers have been appointed allegedly for the purpose of maintaining a pure roll, and I believe that instructions have been issued that the police shall be employed to revise the lists and to ascertain the names of those who are wrongly enrolled. It is not quite clear, however, that they have been instructed at the same time to place on the roll those who  are  entitled to enrolment. If the Minister is prepared to direct the&#34; police to enroll those entitled to enrolment, as well as to remove names that should not be on the roll, there may be some justification for the claim of the Government that they want a pure roll. Just before Parliament met I, in company with some local residents, examined the  second  print of a subdivisional roll for 1913. On comparing it with the old Federal roll, and with a State roll of more recent date, we found that it embodied the names of many who had long left the district. I also found in the course of my scrutiny that the names of seventy-five persons, who had never left the division, had been removed from the roll, although they had voted at the election of 1913. </para>

              <para>- We were comparing the State rolls- with the Federal rolls, and we discovered what I have stated. There were about 128 names out of 2,000 that ought not to have been there, while seventy-five names had been unjustifiably removed. I am speaking of the subdivision of Bingara, and the Divisional Returning Officer at the time was located at Narrabri, a long distance away. He was a relieving postmaster, who had been there for something like twelve months, and, so far as the conduct of the election was concerned, he did the work very well. But what I am speaking of now is the un satisfactory state of the rolls. Is it not strange that with all -the initiative - or even, as I would prefer to call it, the lack of initiative - in this great Department, neither officers nor Minister has hit upon the most effective method that could be devised for purifying the rolls? What I mean is that there has never been any attempt to enlist the services of the postmen and mailmen, who naturally, in the course of their duties, obtain an accurate knowledge of both arrivals and departures* in their several districts. </para>

Political cast-offs are gathered together to do the work of the Liberal party; indeed, no other class of men would stoop to do it. The postman or mailman, as I said, could report as to every man or woman who left or entered the district; and I&#187; have in my mind a case in which, a Liberal organizer was said to have obtained information of the kind with a view to striking off the names of &#62; Labour sympathisers. </para>

              <para>- I never inquire as to a man&#39;s politics; but if the honorable member infers that because a man is a postman he must be a Labour man, he pays a great compliment to that man&#39;s judgment. If, on the other hand, the honorable member concludes that, because some men are not postmen, they, therefore, are Liberals, he belittles their intelligence to a degree that does neither himself nor them credit. If the plan I suggest were adopted, there would be no need for the appointment of permanent Divisional Returning Officers; and this constitutes my objection to the latter, proposal. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with the reason, but with the fact; and the result was that if anything went wrong, the postmasters were able to blame their subordinates. In any case, we all know how a new branch or a Department flourishes like the bay tree; we are always assured that the Department will be only a small one, but before long we find it with a head, clerks, messengers and other understrappers, with complete offices and furniture. I cannot see that the expense of these new appointments will be limited by the salary of &#163;310 to be paid to each man; because, no doubt, clerks, messengers, offices, and furniture will have to be provided, along with travelling expenses, and so forth. The Prime Minister ought to have laid before the House a clear statement of the amount involved, because we should then have found that, not &#163;20,000, but many more thousands, will be required before long. </para>

The Minister shelters himself behind the officers of his Department, as though he had no responsibility and was not required to exercise his common sense. He acts as though he is not possessed of any power of control or initiation. Here is the rubber stamp again. The Minister simply does what his officer tells him to do. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members opposite are complaining now that things are not being done properly. My reply is that the administration of the Act is at present under non-political control, and that, therefore, whatever is done cannot be laid at the door of this Government; it must be laid at the door of that party which will not permit the Act to be altered, and is now criticising the alterations which we wish to make to improve the system. Things are very far from being right; I hope that I am not slandering my country in again pointing out that they are wrong. Since I was first accused of slandering the country, statements have been made on this subject, not by politicians, but by the departmental officers. I hope that they are not slandering the country in giving evidence before a Royal Commission that is investigating the administration of the Electoral Act. This is what they say: In the nine months since the last election, 76,000 names have been removed from the rolls; there are 76,000 names less on the rolls now than there were on the 31st May last. </para>

              <para>- Then these officers who have given evidence on oath before the Royal Commission have been slandering the country. The figures are worthy of record in view of the tirade of abuse distributed through the country by the Leader of the Opposition during the recess. I have no wish to weary the House ;  1  simply wish to say, with regard to the appointments, that the Government are not making them. Though Ministers take responsibility for the appointments, they are being made by the Public Service Commissioner. As to who have been appointed, and as to where they are appointed, I know nothing. All I know is that we are going to put men in these positions whose business it will be to attend to the rolls as to their constant cleansing, and to attend to the work of the division as to its efficiency, also to exercise continuous supervision over what is being done. That is the only way in which we believe we shall get clean rolls and keep the work continually efficient. We are going to -pay these men to devote the whole of their time, ability, and energy to the doing of this work, and we hope, in time, to make an alteration to that state of things which has been so roundly condemned, and which can only be traced, at the last, to. the inefficient and incompetent control of the Department under the inefficient and incompetent Act passed by our predecessors in office. I am sorry to have to say this, but those are the facts of the case, and that condemnation of their Act and its administration comes from the mouths of men who will not permit its alteration, and is the severest condemnation of their conduct and of that of their party. </para>

            <para>. - I think the Prime Minister will regret that he spoke. I cannot make out the policy of the Government in regard to purging the rolls, nor their arithmetic. I understand from the position just placed before us by the Prime Minister that the rolls were deflated between May and December to the extent of 76,000 names, and that there are about 50,000 names entitled to go on the roll in that period. I cannot make out the arithmetic of the honorable member. </para>

              <para>- I leave it to honorable members to draw their own conclusions. According to the Prime Minister, the fact that the rolls are not as they should be is due to the late Government so tying up the Chief Electoral Officer that he is practically independent of the Government of the day; and it is a very good thing that is the case, though possibly it might cause annoyance to the party to which honorable members belong. If the rolls are closed a month before the issue of the writ&#39;, about 50,000 young people who are coming of age are prevented from getting their names on the rolls. What right has any one to prevent these young people securing votes? Honorable members can draw their own inference as to the object of so doing. It is utterly impossible to have a roll on which there are not duplicate names. It is impossible, in the case of a transfer, for a name to be removed from the one roll sufficiency promptly and the transferee entitled to vote in another district. I do not think the country will support the Government in depriving these young people of their votes, or in depriving those people who have to continually shift about to get a living of their votes. Do these people belong to the propertyowning class, or those with fixed incomes, or do they belong to what is generally known as the working classes ? I leave honorable members to answer the question. The recent appointment of Divisional Returning Officers was very significant, so far as South Australia was concerned, particularly in the case of Hindmarsh and Boothby. The Returning Officers in those two districts were men who had had experience of their work since the Commonwealth has been in existence, and in the natural order of things any one with brains, or any one outside a lunatic asylum, in appointing Divisional Returning Officers for those two districts would have appointed men who knew the whole of the work, and had lengthy experience of it. I leave it to any one to draw his own inference as to why men, without any experience, have been appointed by ihia czar, who is above Parliament and thepeople, and is practically supreme in doing as he likes. But I am trying to ascertain what prompted in these appointments the choice of inefficient officers as. against men intimately acquainted with the work to be performed. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> man in business would do as has been done - discharge a man of experience out of pure cussedness - that is the only conclusion that can be drawn - or for other reasons. It may be said that those appointed topositions of this character should be in the Commonwealth or State Service. Later on we may be able to ascertain from the Attorney-General what is thelaw in the matter, but I &#39;contend that the two Divisional Returning Officers to whom I have referred, having a retaining fee of &#163;26 a year each for keeping the rolls, were Commonwealth officers; certainly they were on the day they weresuperseded. Can any one with the average amount of common sense, except a lawyer who can prove anything, explain the step that has been taken, unless it was from a desire, in purging the rolls, to have new and inexperienced men who must, in feeling their way,get hints from somewhere, and the feeling that there would be strong temptation on their part to consider the authorities with whom they happen to be associated ? It is of no use Ministers saying that the Public Service Commissioner makes the appointments. I have heard that said before. The Government shield themselves behind this czar, but that is no satisfaction to honorable members, and should not prevent us pointing out that an intolerable injustice has been served out to- men after years of faithful service. Is that all men are to get from the Commonwealth Government after faithful service, that they should be rewarded by this czar at the first opportunity he gets kicking them out and putting new men in their places, the Government in a <inline font-style="italic">sang froid</inline> way standing by and saying, &#34; It does not concern us &#34; ? However, straws indicate which way the wind is, and this is a very excellent manner of purging the rolls, eminently to the satisfaction of persons it is not worth while mentioning. I have no desire to prolong this matter this morning, as there will be ample opportunity on other occasions to discuss it, but certainly the Government should explain their conduct. </para>

              <para>- If the Prime Minister does not think it worth his while to listen to members when they are speaking in regard to the administration of the Electoral Act, we must take steps to compel him to listen. The honorable member has made a most amazing speech, one which is filled with misrepresentations and inaccuracies. He quoted some figures received from the Chief Electoral Officer, declaring that there were on the rolls 76,000 names less than there were nine months ago, and that 54,000 electors have qualified for enrolment since then. Then the honorable member adds the two totals together, and says that there were 130,000 names on the rolls nine months ago that ought not to have been there. How the Prime Minister adduces that result from the figures I do not know. In the first place we have no proof that 54,000 people have enrolled; that is only assumption.. As a matter of fact, I know that in Ballarat hundreds of names have not been enrolled. Yet the Prime Minister assumes that the whole of them are enrolled, and says, &#34; There you are, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is right; there were 130,000 names on the roll nine months ago that had no right to be there.&#34; The honorable member forgets that many names are being removed to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> only considers thosewho qualify for enrolment by coming of age or entering the country. He takes no cognisance of the thousands of people, who are continually changing their addresses, and whose names have in consequence been struck off the rolls and not again enrolled. The Commonwealth Statistician tells us that 33 per cent. of the population in the metropolitan area shift their addresses every year. That means that in three years the whole population shifts. </para>

              <para>- They come from the Federal Statistician. I obtained them from the honorable member for Cook. Honorable members will see that if that percentage be correct, thousands of names are continually being struck off the roll, and there must have been many struck off during the last nine months and not placed on the rolls again. Therefore, there is nothing in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the rolls at the last election were inflated to the extent of 130,000 names. As a matter of fact, I do not think there was much to complain of in regard to the rolls at the last election. There may have been a few names on the rolls which ought to have been removed on account of death or other causes, but that was not the fault of the Act or of those administering it. Rather was it caused by the economy that was practised, and the insufficient number of officials engaged. Had a sufficient number of officers been employed, the rolls at last election would probably have been the cleanest we have ever had. I would like to&#39; ask the Prime Minister if it is his intention to have an entirely new roll prepared when the police have handed in their reports ? </para>

              <para>- If the Prime Min. ister can interject in that way, he could answer my question by a simple interjection. I also desire to know what is to be done with the names, which the police hand in, of people who are not enrolled ? Evidently the police have not  been given instructions to carry cards with them on their canvass, and to secure the enrolment of those who are not enrolled; they simply hand in the names to the Divisional Returning Officers. There may be prosecutions or there may not, and the possibility is that those people will not be enrolled. If the Government desire a complete roll as well as a clean roll, it would be a good idea for the police to carry enrolment cards with them, and whenever they come to a family whose names are not on the rolls they should leave cards, and so facilitate enrolment. </para>

              <para>- The police could  simply  mention to such people that if they did not enroll they would be liable to be prosecuted under the Electoral Act. There is another aspect of the situation. In one electorate that I know of, the Divisional Returning Officer is refusing to take the names of those, who leave the district. I know of one political agent who handed in a list of 200 names, and the officer said, &#34; No, we cannot strike any names off until the police have completed their investigations.&#34; My opinion is that if the Government do not intend to issue the new roll until the police have completed their canvass there will be no new roll prepared inside of twelve months. While we are waiting for the new rolls, is there to be no cleansing? Can we not have facilities for objecting as both parties have been doing up till  the last few months? Yet that agent was told by a Divisional Returning Officer the other day that he could not receive any lists, and that no further names would be removed until the police had completed their canvass. I hope the Prime Minister will consider that aspect of the question. The honorable member has told us that the Electoral Department is not under the control of Ministers, that the officers are in control of it. Then, why do we have a Minister in charge of the Department ? If the Department is not under the control of the Government, we might just as well have only the officers, and no Cabinet Minister at all. That is something like the answer which the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs gave when he was attacked in connexion with the Teesdale Smith contract; he said that the officers have control. Now we have the Prime Minister saying that Ministers can do nothing in the Electoral Department, that everything rests with the officers. That seems to me to be an absurdity. I cannot .conceive of responsible government being carried on in that manner. Surely a Minister can have a consultation with the Chief Electoral Officer, and the recommendations which come from both sides of the House could be conveyed to him. In connexion with the new appointments which have been made, I think the Government have made a mistake. They have incurred an unnecessary and unwarranted expense, and we do not know where it is going to lead us to. I have seen a statement that the cost will be something like &#163;70,000, and probably &#163;100,000. It is true that the postmasters, who were the Divisional Returning Officers previously, had a good deal of other work to do, and were not in a position to give all their time to. the electoral work; it is said that on that account the rolls were overloaded. I would point out that, to a large extent, the postmasters delegated their work to subordinate officers, and it was those subordinate officers who did the work . at the last election. I know that was so in one or two electorates in Victoria. The responsibility was with the postmaster, but the actual work was done by another officer acting under his instructions. All that was necessary for the Government to have done was to have provided at the most &#163;5,000 &#39;or &#163;10,000 per annum for the purpose of providing the postmasters with further clerical assistance. There is a good deal in the argument put forward by the honorable member for Hindmarsh, that owing to the Public Service Commissioner being the sole dictator as to who shall be appointed to these positions, many of the officers who did the work at the last election, and proved themselves to be qualified for the work, are regarded as ineligible for appointment as Divisional Returning Officers. I trust that the Prime Minister will take a note of this suggestion. The chief assistants to the Divisional Returning Officers have not been appointed yet. I know of cases where clerks are applying for these positions, and I understand that they are held to be disqualified because they are not in the clerical division of the Public Service. They are employed in the general division in the Postal Department, but be-  cause they have not passed some clerical examination, they are held to he disqualified for appointment as clerks to the Divisional Returning Officers. I know of one young man - not a Labour man ; if he has any politics they are probably Liberal - who practically did the work in one electorate at last election. In fact, he has been doing the electoral work until within the last few days, and I am now informed that he is held to be disqualified from being appointed to the position of clerk to the Divisional Returning Officer. The appointment would not have been much of an increase on his present salary, it&#39; is true, but I should think the Electoral Department would welcome the opportunity of getting into the service to conduct elections those who have had experience, and by that experience proved themselves qualified to conduct an election as it should be conducted. I suppose there are many officers who will be similarly precluded from being appointed. That seems to me to be most unfair. Surely in making the appointments, it is not too late for the Cabinet to determine that the appointments shall not be only from amongst those qualified by having passed a clerical examination. </para>

            <para>- I have already pointed out that one reason why leave should be refused is that the Bill is not what was promised. The Government promised an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; they now offer this substitute, which is unnecessary, since what the Bill proposes to do has already been done by administrative act. Another reason is that the Bill is not what it pretends to be. The Government say that they are opposed to the principle of preference to unionists; but this Bill in no sense assails the general application of that principle. Then, again, the Government cannot hope to pass the Bill. Although they may bludgeon it through this House, they know full well that it will be defeated once more in the Senate. Leave to introduce the Bill should also be refused because it is an obstruction to public business, and must delay urgent business which demands our attention. Another reason why it should not be introduced is that it cannot be enforced. There is no law by which the present, or any other Government, can compel preference to unionists or nonpreference, so long as the organizations maintain their solidarity. We had a remarkable illustration of that quite recently when the waterside workers, by the very strength of their union, compelled the Arbitration Court machine to get to work when, otherwise, they would have been unable to have their case heard. The Bill, further, is against the spirit of the existing law in relation to industrial matters; and until the Government are prepared to amend the law which recognises the right of the workers to have their unions, and gives the Court power to grant them preference in employment, this Bill should not be allowed to come before us. Still another objection to it ia that it will promote strife. The application of this prohibition of preference to unionists in the vague, general way proposed by the Government, will promote strife of the worst character. Nothing is more calculated to lead to more disorder, more unrest, and revolution in this or in any other community than is a proposal of this kind. Another reason for my opposition to the Bill is that it is opposed to modern tendencies. All over the world to-day the tendency is entirely in the opposite direction from that suggested by the Ministry. It may be suggested that the evidences offering from, say, New Zealand, South Africa, Dublin, and Colorado, disprove my statement. I contend, however, that they prove only that every attempt to deny the right of the men to form their union, or to deny them the power to protect themselves by means of unionism, is foredoomed to  failure. The Prime Minister knows better than any one in this House that the campaign  on  which  he  has started - the campaign  to  smash up unionism,  to  deny  to  unionists the right  to  enjoy the results  of  their unionism - is necessarily and emphatically foredoomed  to  disaster, and that  he  will  be  crushed beneath the ruins  of  his own legislation. The Bill is being promoted for a selfish purpose. Behind this movement there stand &#39;the serried ranks  of  the employers, who for deeply selfish and prejudiced purposes are urging the Government  to  this action. Another reason why I oppose the Bill is that it makes industrial conditions the football  of  party politics. This community,  as  well  as  those  of  other countries, is seeking a way out  of  the present system  of  party government. The present system has had  Its  day; it has outlived its usefulness.  ?et  the Government propose  to  make the bread and butter questions  of  the Community the football  of  party politics, they propose  to  degrade the industrial life  of  the community for a mere matter of which party shall be in and which shall be out. Party government is  to be  the deciding factor  as to  how, &#39; when, and where men shall engage  in  the ordinary avocations  of  life. Last evening I was seeking  to  point out that those who talk  so  glibly about liberty, and their desire that there shall  be  equal opportunities for  all,  have always a smug smile and a certain reserve of satisfaction in complimenting unionism. How kindly they talk about it! What they object  to,  they say, is political unionism. I ask honorable members  to  recall with  me  the experience  of  the trade union movement in regard  to  politics. Every one knows that from the very inception  of  the trade union movement trade unionists have been subjected  to  the most diabolical treatment by Acts  of  Parliament, political parties, and the  machine of  party politics. Let  me  make one  or  two small quotations in that connexion respecting the British Combination Laws  of  1799. In the <inline font-style="italic">History of the Friendly Society of Ironmoulders,</inline> founded in 1809,  we  read - </para>

          <para>The infamous Combination Laws were passed in 1799, and were not repealed until fifteen years after the formation of the society. During the whole of this time the proceedings of the society were illegal, and rendered nil its members liable to criminal prosecution. . . . Unfortunately, we have no documentary  evi- dence  of the society&#39;s proceedings during the first twenty years of its existence. This is not Surprising when we consider the conditions under which the work of the society was carried on. We have of necessity to rely on tradition, and one well-authenticated tradition is that in the earlier period of its history the officers had to meet at night in a field for the purpose of receiving the contributions of its members, and had to bury the books to prevent them being seized by the authorities. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I could make further quotations which go to show that those who supported the trade union movement had to fight against iniquitous acts of .Parliament which rendered their unions illegal, and laid them under certain restrictions and unreasonable disadvantages. Here is another quotation, this time from the <inline font-style="italic">History of Trade Unionism,</inline> by Sidney Webb- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Almost any action taken by trade unionists to induce a man not to accept employment at a struck shop resulted, under the new .Act, in imprisonment with hard labour. The intolerable injustice of this state of things was made more glaring by the freedom allowed to the employers to make all possible use of &#34;black lists &#34; and &#34; character notes,&#34; by which obnoxious men were prevented from getting work. No prosecution ever took place for this form of molestation or obstruction. No employer was ever placed in the dock under the law which professedly applied to both parties. In short, boycotting by the employers was freely permitted; boycotting by the men was put down by the police. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Throughout the history of the movement there has been one law for the employer and another for the employe. The employer was protected by law; the employe was prosecuted by the law. While the employer could do what he chose under the sanction of the law, the employe dare not express his opinions, because that same law, made by those whose interests were opposed to his own, rendered it impossible for him to have any rights. The history of the Old Country reeks with stories of the infamous treatment of the workers - men who dare not stand up for their common law rights. Was not the Chartist movement based upon a recognition of that principle? Was not the whole trade union movement a fight, by political action, against the opponents of the workers? The descendants of those old time opponents - the Government and their supporters - say that unionism should not ally itself with political action, and they, propose to prohibit preference of employment to men because of their association with political organizations. </para>

I have here three copies of the <inline font-style="italic">Mildura Cultivator,</inline> in which there appears what is described as &#34; An Imaginary Story of the Dried Fruits Industry,&#34; entitled &#34;A Sign of the Times.&#34; I visited Mildura about a fortnight ago, and heard the author of these articles, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> J. De Garis, give evidence before the Fruit Commission regarding the benefits of unionism. He expressed considerable satisfaction with the organization of the fruit pickers, but objected to their decision in regard to political action. These articles are rather cleverly written, and I propose to make one or two quotations from them so that honorable members may see what strength - I was rather inclined to say what stupidity - there is in the attempt to divorce legitimate unionism from political action. Telling how the Mildura fruit-growers were faced with certain difficulties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. De</inline> Garis writes: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The spirit of unrest amongst growers was, however, in the air. Grievances - some real, some imaginary - had been aired and subsequently exaggerated, and  small  knots of growers were always to be found earnestly discussing the fruit situation. Most of these groups had the common object of maintaining, but at the same time improving, the present organization in the common interest; but, unfortunately, others, impelled by short-sighted and selfish motives, looked for a way to immediately benefit their own pockets, regardless of the effect on their equally needy neighbours. </para>

            <para>- I think so; in fact, I fancy it will go through this House. After the episode of this morning, when the Prime Minister was so repeatedly rebuked by the  Speaker,  I do not think that anything will happen; but that, as the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> said a week ago in regard to the censure debate, there will be no defection from the Liberal ranks, and the question will be carried on the casting vote of the  Speaker.  Be that as it may, we ask the Government for industrial peace, and they offer war; we suggest conciliation, and they shout defiance; we advise arbitration, and their reply is victimization; we preach fraternity, and they advocate fratricide; we desire cooperation, and they insist on competition. It does not matter what the Government intend to do, they cannot build on any hope of either smashing the unions or preventing them taking part in politics. Of this we have had ample evidence from other parts of the world. The whole question turns on the recognition of the right of the men to act through their unions; and South Africa, New Zealand, Dublin, and Colorado have given the answer. It is idle for men like Rockefeller, with his millions behind him, to say that unionization of the mines will not be tolerated for an instant. Some of us will live to see the day, even, perhaps, in the lifetime of Rockefeller himself, when there will be complete acceptance of the unionization of the. mines, whether he likes it or not. Whether or not we shall live to see the day there will be the unionization, not only of the mines, but of every other industrial employment in the community, as certainly as tomorrow&#39;s sun will rise. Honorable members opposite, and those who think with them, are like political <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Partingtons,</inline> trying to sweep back the tide of Democracy, and to prevent men realizing what they are justly and honestly entitled to. All over the world to-day there are evidences of industrial unrest, due entirely, first of all, to the non-recognition of the unions, and, secondly, to the attempt to compel men to work with nonunionists. </para>

            <para>- Yes, sir; thank you. It is said that to oppose leave to introduce a Bill is a very unusual procedure, but whatever may have been the custom here I understand that it is a very, old practice that has been exercised for some very useful public purposes. I understand that on one occasion it was used by Joseph Hume in connexion with one of the Castlereagh Coercion Bills - or the six &#34;Gagging&#34; Bills, as they were termed, which to some extent was identical with the proposal of the AttorneyGeneral. The introduction of measures has in the past been opposed on the grounds that they were against the public interest. That has been done again and again, and if there is any just ground for opposing the introduction of a measure it certainly seems to me that the present is the time and the occasion for such a step. We could understand the introduction of the Bill if it were to serve some useful purpose, or seek to achieve some public good, but if it is merely introduced in order to arouse party passion and divide the community into warring factions it will serve no public good, and Parliament should not allow any such Bill to be introduced or permit its time to be occupied in discussing its provisions. There is no Department of the Commonwealth in which preference to unionists exists; therefore we are asked to give leave to introduce a Bill which proposes to deal with something that is nonexistent, and which contains no provision to prohibit that which it professes to prohibit. Such a measure is not only a fraudulent proposition, but must be a sham and a delusion even to those who profess to believe in it. </para>

Therefore, in the opinion of this House it is expedient and desirable, and is most fully in accord with the proper exercise of the powers of this House, that legislation to deal with the Beef Trust, the Tariff, and with social insurance against sickness and unemployment should take precedence over the Bill now sought to be introduced, and that  His  Majesty&#39;s Ministers be requested to reconsider their decision in this regard.&#34; </para>

            <para>- The function of Parliament is&#60; to consider those things for which it. is called together, and not to divert public attention from them. Not only did the Government go to the country in denunciation of the previous Government, because of its extravagance and maladministration of the public funds, but it also put forward definite propositions. Among the propositions of the party led by the honorable member for Parramatta was one which provided for a scheme of insurance against sickness and unemployment. On platform after platform the Attorney-General announced that the method of giving aids and grants, whether they be in respect of maternity or old-age, was improper, because it undermined the moral and physical stamina of the people, and he said that the basis should be a contributory scheme, and that the Government proposed to put such a scheme before Parliament to apply to the maternity allowance. Some honorable members opposite also thought that the old-age pensions should be on a contributory basis, with contributions from workers and employers and a subsidy from the Government. However, nearly eighteen months have gone by, and no Bill has been prepared, or presented, dealing with this matter. At no stage have the Government shown any intention of bringing forward a measure dealing with this matter, which they declared was of such vast importance. </para>

            <para>- If a statement is not true it would not be uttered by me. Truth is my special perquisite and my exclusive property. I exhibit the love of truth to a greater extent than any other honorable member. Anything in the shape of obstruction, as it has been designated, on the part of honorable members on this side of the Chamber has been put up by them against measures of the character of that proposed to be introduced, but the Government have not brought forward a single measure, outside controversial subjects, which they have not been able to get passed. Even measures to which this party was opposed the Government have been able to push through another place, and the means they had at their disposal last session to enable them to do so are again at their disposal this session. If Ministers bring all their batteries to bear, and bring forward their proposal for social insurance against sickness and unemployment, they can take it that we, as a party, dare not put1 up any hostility towards it. If we opposed that class of legislation we should be presented to the country in a most unfavorable light. Our attitude would be held to be highly objectionable. Bub the mere fact that the Government do not bring forward such a proposition is clear evidence that they do not possess such a policy, and that they have no intention of presenting it, so that their platform utterances as to social insurance schemes were utterly valueless, and worth no more than the breath with which they were uttered. Another statement on the platforms at the last election was that for three years the Labour party had done nothing in connexion with the Tariff, and we were told that once the party led by the honorable member for Parramatta were in power they would utilize their first session to make up for the delinquencies of the Labour Government, and introduce measures to rectify anomalies in the Tariff. On the day following the election the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> said that every Liberal member was pledged to the rectification of anomalies in the Tariff, and that the people would have the assurance of the honorable member for Indi, and the honorable member for Wannon, and other Liberals elected in Victoria, that the Government would be compelled by the necessities of its existence to immediately proceed with the rectification of anomalies in the Tariff. The only Ministerial statement we have had in regard to a matter of such vast public importance is that made by the Prime Minister to-day that nothing will be done until the Inter-State Commission present their report. If this Commission make no efforts to present a report within twelve months, or two years or three years, nothing is to be done. Yet Ministers know, as every one knows full well, that when the report of the Inter-State Commission does come to hand no honorable member is going to take any notice of it. Each honorable member will exercise his own judgment, and select from the evidence that portion that will suit his own constituents, and turn down anything against the interests of his constituents. -As the honorable member for West Sydney has said, what troubles the Government now is the matter of revenue, yet Ministers are not prepared to do anything in the direction of making an alteration in the Tariff that will bring about an increase of revenue. Another statement we have heard is . that the Labour party were doing a senseless thing in asking for an amendment of the Constitution. It was said that we were denouncing something that did not exist when we spoke of the Beef Trust and the absolute necessity for an alteration of the Constitution to enable us to effectively deal with such bodies. And now the Government, in spite of the facts which confront them in regard to the operations of the trust in Queensland and elsewhere, say that the only way they propose to deal with the evil is by the appointment of another Royal Commission. Every time they put off their pro blems in this way. They put off the consideration of every question of public importance by the suggestion that there will be further consideration at some later date, or by the remission of the question to a Royal Commission for investigation. In that way their whole business is wrapped up. They hide their lack of policy, their differences amongst themselves, and their chaotic minds, by remitting their responsibilities to a Royal Commission, so a3 to shelve their troubles and in order that they may not be troubled by them. This proposed Royal Commission will be of absolutely no use. It will be merely a waste of public money. And will the honorable member for Henty support the Government in this matter ? What has the honorable member done to support his attitude and all that he has said on the public platform against the trust? He degrades his manhood by supporting a Government who will do nothing, and have no intention of doing anything. I am ashamed of him. This gentleman, who has voiced strong criticism from time to time, sits there silent and ashamed of himself, knowing that it is better to hide his shame in silence, because he fears to speak-. In regard to the Meat Trust, the whole question is to be shelved by referring the matter to a Royal Commission, after which, we are told, it will be dealt with by legislation. But, as the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> points out- </para>

            <para>- In moving the amendment, I pointed out that this House ought to deal with more important proposals than that which is contained in this Bill, and I mentioned in my amendment some of the subjects which I considered of great importance, and which the Government ought to deal with. Amongst those subjects I included this matter, and stated that the Government ought to take immediate action in connexion with theMeat Trust, because it is of considerablymore importance to the general body of consumers than the question of theabolition of preference to unionists in the Government service. It has been clearly admitted by the Government, from time to time, on the platform and in this Parliament, that an immediate amendment of the Constitution should take place, in, order to deal with, some of the evils which confront this country. And we have been promised that those matters will be introduced when these other subjects, which they know will mean endless controversy, have been got out of the way. No effort has been made to introduce the legislation that this country urgently needs, but Parliament is to be asked to occupy its time, from week to week, in a discussion of measures of this character that will not make for one more crust of bread or augment the happiness of a single human being in the country. In those circumstances it is the duty of Parliament to prohibit the Government introducing and discussing measures that can achieve no possible good. Of the uselessness of this measure we had an instance last session, when the Bill was previously introduced. The Attorney-General, in introducing the Bill on that occasion, said that it had always been a feature of Governments in this community that, once they took their position on the Treasury bench, they were there to administer the law for all sections of the people equally. The honorable member ignores the fact that it has been the custom of all Governments, in all countries, and at all times, to administer the law in the exclusive interests of a particular party. Just as long as Governments were controlled by Kings, they governed in the interests of the King&#39;s party; so long as they were controlled by the Land party, all legislation was constructed in the interests of land monopoly; so long as Governments were formed in the interests of the manufacturers, so long was all legislation framed in the interests of the manufacturing classes and the great capitalists; and sweating was permitted to exist untrammelled and unrestricted, labour was ill paid, industrial combination amongst the workers was prohibited, and their political rights were destroyed. I repeat that in all ages and in all countries Governments have been controlled wholly and solely by, and have made their laws exclusively in the interests of, the classes they represented. Then we come to a period in our history when the Government must stand for the great bulk of the community. And when we recognise as a sound principle that man has only risen from the dens of savagery to the position he occupies to-day by associative effort with his fellow-men, and that organization and combination are essentials to the progress of the working class, we must also recognise that it is the duty of the Government to give their assistance to such associative efforts which so elevate men in the scale of civilization.&#39; Therefore preference becomes a fundamental principle, and must be recognised as part and parcel of the laws of the country. This Commonwealth Parliament has accepted that principle as part and parcel of the laws of this country. Preference is not a policy to be denounced or prohibited by any Government; it is not a thing to begin here and end there, but has been accepted as a sound principle and enacted in the laws of our Parliament.  It stands in the Arbitration Act, and in innumerable forms prefer^ence has been given and accepted throughout the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Organized effort on the part of the workers is recognised in the laws of the country, and it has never been shown that preference to unionists as an aid to that legislation is injurious to the public. </para>

            <para>- And if it be a bad principle, it is bad no matter where it stands. Whether in law or in administration, whether administered by the officer of a Department or by a Judge of the High Court, it has been recognised as essential; it has been held to be good in principle, no matter by whom applied. Hardly a man who occupied a position in this Chamber at the time of the enactment of the Arbitration Act failed to recognise that the principle was essential if we were to have the substitution of industrial peace for industrial strife ; and, because it was recognised that preference was essential to these corporate powers of organized workers on the one hand, and organized employers on the other, going into the Court and laying their complaints before a Judge for him to give his decision upon - because it was recognised that these two things could not exist unless preference was given to those who worked and strove, preference became one of the features of that law. If a body of men sent from all parts of Australia can meet in this chamber and lay it down that a Judge of the High Court may impose preference on any body of private employers, it becomes the bounden duty of Parliament, in its own position as an employer, to give that preference in its own organization. </para>

            <para>- Of -course, not if Parliament thinks otherwise. All depends on who hold the predominant power in this Parliament. If one section of Parliament thinks it should be so, it is so, and rightly ; because it is only applying to the Government service that principle of law which Parliament has laid down for private employers. And the very class .of men who say they believe it to be sound in law, but not in administration, are the men who gave sufficient power to do by the law itself, through the Arbitration Court, that which they will not do in their own administration. There is nobody who can point in an*y direction to any man who has been deprived of his position by any preference given to unionists. Recognising that great organizations are essential to the workmen&#39;s well-being, and that his labour is as valuable to him as the property of any exclusive Jew, Parliament gives its sanction to such organizations and builds them up. If there be anything good in such organizations, it is the bounden duty of Parliament to give every assistance to them. When past Governments, controlled by kings and landlords, took from the people their commons, deprived them of access to the land, and made them slaves in the country, they served their own class; and even, in the Old Country to-day, where the wealth is still in the hands of the minority, the power of landlordism is still so predominant that they have been able to maintain laws for their own exclusive benefit. But in this newer country, where there has been, an increase in the power of the working people, it is inevitable that a democratic Government should make laws and operate them for the class to which they belong. And this particular form of class government stands on a higher plane than any other form of class government, because it is in the interests of those who compose the great mass of the working population of the country. All other forms of class legislation have been in. the interests of a comparative few, but for the first time in the history of the world, we have seen in Australia Governments, composed of working men, legislating in the interests of the common good,, and to the extent that they build up their organizations they build up instrumentalities for the common weal, just as in the United States of America and other countries, where the wealthy hold power, they make laws to maintain the interests of the moneyed classes. TheGovernment hope, by means of this Bill,, to appeal to the prejudices of a particularfaction. A new principle, whenever applied, appeals at once to the timid - to those who are scared by new forms of administration and legislation. &#39; New proposals, whatever their character, howeverbeneficial they may be - whether they be for the enlargement of the franchise on the one hand or for the extension of social legislation on the other - are often opposed by the very people whom they are designed to benefit, because they believe that they will work to their injury. We have seen this occur in connexion with the extension of the franchise. It has been said,, time after time, that to extend the franchise to the common people would be todo injury to the country. Lord Brougham,, in the Reform Parliament of 1832, said, that, when speaking to the people of England, he referred, not to the mob, not tothe scum and dregs of the population, but to the respectable middle classes! Therespectable middle classes, and the greatbulk of the starving multitude had novoice in the affairs of the country. It was said, indeed, that to endow thesepeople with votes would be to cause theBritish Empire to fall to pieces. Did&#39; not Judge McQueen, in the Scottish Courts, say that to suggest that theBritish Government and the British Courts could be made better was in itself absolute sedition, and it was for such things that men in the days of the Chartists were transported to this country. Every measure to alleviate the condition of the working classes - factory legislation in all its forms - has been misrepresented by its opponents, who have sought to intimidate those whom it was designed to benefit by alleging that such measures, if carried, would lead to injustice, would be partial in their operation, and would work to the injury of the great bulk of the people. It is upon the same old effete argument that the Government rely, and upon which they desire to appeal to the country, if they can. They hope, by appealing to the prejudices of a section of the people on the one hand-, and to the fears of the timid on the other, to secure a victory. It is not for the public good that they propose this legislation. This Bill creates nothing, destroys nothing, prevents nothing. There is nothing which it professes to stop that could not be stopped the day after its rejection. If preference to unionists be an evil to the country - if it deprives any one of bread, if it injures any woman or child, then there ought to be enacted strict legislation to prevent it. If preference to unionists be an iniquity, then any Bill to deal with it should be something more than a mere pious affirmation of a principle. An honest Government, believing preference to unionists to be injurious to the country, would provide for the imposition of penalties on those who offended against a law declaring that preference should not be granted. If, by reason of preference to unionists, liberty lay bleeding in the dust, an honest Government would seek to protect that liberty by providing for the imposition of penalties for any violation of it. If they believed that preference to unionists deprived men of the right to live, they would protect their lives by providing for the imposition of penalties on those who sought to deprive men of their living. But if this Bill be passed to-morrow, it will not prevent any Minister orany Government official from granting preference to any person or party. At what point does this prohibition of preference to unionists stop short ? Only at the preference which we gave, not to any particular individual, but to all within the fold of organization; so that it might be said, &#34;Come within the fold. Take your part in the common battle. If you are going to be participants in the benefits of organization, pay your share and take your part in the common sacrifice.&#34; This prohibition is aimed merely at working-class organization. Some honorable member said yesterday that it applied to the legal profession. But does it? I say that it does not, in any shape or form. </para>

            <para>- He takes care that it will not apply either to himself or to his profession. The law of this State declares that there shall be an amalgamation of the legal professions. It provides that a solicitor may undertake the business of a barrister, and that a barrister may practise as a solicitor. It enlarges the liberty of those who enter the legal profession. The organization to which the Attorney-General belongs narrows down that liberty. It is not merely a combination to preserve the rights of its members. It acts in deliberate defiance of the law. The members of the Bar Association maintain a combination to nullify the law; to make it a dead letter; to frustrate it. It pursues practices of boycotting which, if followed by the members of an ordinary working-class organization, would land the great bulk of them in gaol for fraud. The essential fact, so far as this Bill is concerned, is that it is the mere affirmation of a principle on the part of the Government, and that the Government have no real belief in that principle. They do not propose to apply it to all sections of the community. These men, who say that it is the duty of the Government to apply the law fairly, extend it to only a particular section when they come to apply it. A principle which is an iniquity when practised by others is a virtue when practised by themselves. Let any man who, having obeyed the law of his country, having passed the requisite examinations, walk into the Courts of this State and attempt to pursue the practice of his profession as a barrister and solicitor in accordance with the law of the land. What is his experience? The members of the Bar Association to which the Attorney-General belongs, boycott him, not only in his every-day occupation, but pursue him with their boycott into his social life. They will not associate with him privately. They impose upon him the penalty of social ostracism. That industrial boycott, which the Attorney-General and his friends denounce as iniquitous when pursued by the working classes, is something altogether different when applied by themselves to all outside their rank and file. This Bill which the Government ask for leave to introduce is a meaningless thing. It can avail them nothing. Why is it brought forward? It is not designed to achieve the common good. It is designed merely to enable honorable members to arrange themselves in rival camps; to make war with each other concerning matters that mean nothing, and to carry that war into the country. The Bill is of no more value than is the mere affirmation of a principle by a debating society or a church literary organization. That being so, why do we discuss it? Why do we debate it? The Attorney-General says it is but the affirmation of a principle. He knows full well that every one who believes in the principle of preference to unionists is bound to oppose the Bill, and to affirm his belief in the principle of preference. In like manner, honorable members opposite know full well that the Bill is not worth the paper it is printed on ; but they are driven, in the circumstances into which they have been pushed by their Government, to vote for it, and to refrain from making any statement. They know that, in their hearts, they are opposed to this principle. We have, therefore, the spectacle of a House of seventy-five members discussing a measure that is not worth the paper it is printed on. Every honorable member knows that it effects no good, does no evil, creates nothing, prevents nothing, prohibits nothing, destroys nothing. Yet we are bound to debate it, and to say to what extent we believe or disbelieve in the principle. We are bound, not only to vote against this Bill, but to debate it, because the great bulk of the people outside will not understand our attitude unless we do so. And so with honorable members opposite. If they allow it to pass, they have to affirm their hostility to preference, and to declare that this Bill will abolish preference. As a matter of fact, it abolishes nothing, because whatever preference to unionists existed while the late Government were in office disappeared the day the present Government came into power. The Government and their supporters, however, have to vote for the affirmation of this principle. Vital issues, such as the amendment of the Constitution, which the AttorneyGeneral has declared to be absolutely essential for the good government of the country, have, meantime, to remain in abeyance. Measures to provide for insurance against sickness and unemployment, to deal with the question of the Tariff, the operations of the great Beef Trust, and the financial situation, are meantime held back. Is not the situation of this country critical ? We have been told by the Government that it is. We have been told that it is imperative that legislation should be immediately introduced to deal with it, and that it will be introduced as soon as this measure has been got out of the way. </para>

            <para>- I have already told the honorable member that the Government are proposing to introduce, in this Bill, a measure that means nothing. If I struck out the word &#34;prohibition,&#34; and made this a Bill to provide for preference to unionists, what would the honorable member say if I invited him to let it go through ? Would he not reply at once, &#34; How can I vote for a Bill by which you ask me to affirm my belief in preference to unionists? The country would not understand me if I merely voted upon it without explaining my attitude. I am bound, therefore, to affirm the- principle in which I believe, just as I would have to do if this were a debating society. I must give my affirmation or denial to something which really means nothing.&#34; It is admitted that the financial situation is serious; that our revenues are declining, and our responsibilities increasing. Our defence expenditure is growing, and the Government are being driven to close down Government works in all directions. The expenditure on the Federal Capital and the Northern Territory has been- cut down. Public works are either stagnating, or being carried on so feebly and intermittently that all that can be said of them is that life still remains in them. In every possible direction, in every Commonwealth factory, the Government are cutting down expenditure. We find day by day that the services of men and women employed by the Government are being dispensed with. This is so in the Post Office; and at Mount Garnbier we had the Prime Minister declaring that that Department absorbs more and more money - that the more money there is poured into it, the more is demanded. That is the helpless situation in which the Prime Minister confesses he finds himself in this connexion; and similar conditions prevail in other directions of Commonwealth activity. The responsibilities of the Government increase year by year, and Ministers do not know how to meet them. All they can say is, not  &#39; Let us deal with them now, &#39; &#39; but &#39; &#39; We will deal with them later on.&#34; That is not a very encouraging attitude on the part of the Government. The stability of the country depends on whether it is able to retain its credit; and we must ask ourselves by what means our responsibilities can be met, and in what directions we are to look for the necessary money. Are these not the vital questions of to-day? It is our imperative duty to repel this Bill - to, if possible, prevent its introduction - and to affirm it as a fraud, a sham, and a delusion, to which no Parliament should consent. It is something which we should not permit for a moment; and we have a right to demand that the Government shall proceed to deal with the things that really count. For those reasons, I beg leave to submit the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I submit that this amendment is out of order. It is clearly out of order so far as the first portion of it is concerned, where it merely amounts to negativing the motion before the House, with a statement of the reasons why the motion should be negatived. The second part asks the House to affirm that certain other matters, such as the Tariff, the Beef Trust, and social assurance against sickness and unemployment, should be legislated on in priority; and this, I submit, is irrelevant to the subjectmatter of the motion. Since the honorable member for Bourke announced his intention to submit the amendment, I have looked over the authorities, and I beg to draw attention to the fact that, though it is undoubtedly true that, on a motion either for leave to introduce a Bill or for the second reading, it is quite competent to move an amendment by leaving out all the words after &#34; That,&#34; and introducing others, the amendment must be relevant to the subject-matter of the motion or Bill. </para>

        <para class="block">The date of that case is 1814, and it is the oldest amongst those I have cited. The question was a countervailing duty of Excise on bleaching powder imported from Ireland; and honorable members know that oxygenated muriatic acid is a chemical which was at that time very largely used for bleaching. Here was an important matter which the House might reasonably regard as directly relevant to the question they were asked to determine ; it was not a matter of technical words, language, or form, but a matter of reality and substance. Whether that is so in this case can be shown by looking at the language of the proposed amendment, which reads - </para>

            <para>- Honorable members could discuss the whole subject of the necessity for introducing legislation to deal with the Beef Trust. That means that honorable members could discuss, as the honorable member last night was discussing, all the circumstances and alleged circumstances that exist, creating the  nenessity  for a Bill. Under the heading of social insurance, honorable members could discuss the existing conditions that render necessary the introduction of a Bill. Certainly they could not discuss the detailed merits of a Bill, seeing that it would not be before the House, but they could discuss the whole of the subject necessitating the Bill. This has never been done, and certainly should not be permitted in this case, being entirely irrelevant to the motion I submitted to the House. </para>

            <para>- The illustrations used by the Attorney-General were noteworthy by reason of the dust that had accumulated on them. He only selected those which suited his desires, but there are some more recent illustrations. Not only does <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> say it, but in all parliamentary procedure it is laid down that there are two unmistakable things honorable members can do on a motion for leave to introduce a Bill. An amendment to add words with a view of condemning the proposed legislation is permitted, and the House may proceed to alter the time for the introduction of the Bill. That is a common practice in the House of Commons and in the Canadian Parliament. But not to take too ancient examples, I can quote the Government of Ireland Bill of 1886 and 1893, the Independence of Parliament Bill of 1884, and a Bill dealing with the criminal law in 18S7. Whatever may be wrong about the first part of my amendment, according to common practice the latter part of it cannot be questioned, seeing that it is framed in almost similar language to that employed in an amendment moved in the House of Commons on the 24th January, 1881, the debate upon which lasted until 2nd February,  1881. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forster</inline> moved for leave to introduce a Bill for the protection of life and property, and upon that motion <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lyons</inline> moved an amendment as follows: - </para>

        <para class="block">There we have the Government bringing in a criminal law, and an amendment is permitted dealing with a matter in no way relating to crime, but relating to a social and economic question. By no stretch of imagination can laws dealing with the land question be said to have any relation to criminal law, such as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forster.</inline> Therefore, I submit that the latter part of my amend- ment is valid, and that it is in accord with common practice, and also that there is nothing in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> or any authorities laying it down that an amendment upon the motion for leave to introduce a Bill shall be in any way relevant to the motion.

            <para>- There are some honorable members who pose as eminent authorities on this as well as any other matter that may come before the House. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> is dealing, on page 293, with amendments to questions and the mode of proposing amendments, including those on motions for leave to introduce Bills. As a matter of fact, he examined those very authorities the AttorneyGeneral has cited, and states his definite conclusion on an examination of those authorities. In support of his contention, the honorable member for Bourke mentioned that a debate took place for five days in the House of Commons on a matter which he considers to be analogous to his own amendment. The honorable member&#39;s amendment is in the nature of a negation, and in so far as it is not a negation, it refers to all sorts of matters, such as the Beef Trust, the Tariff, and National Insurance, which can have no reference whatever to the subject of preference to unionists. The very case that he cited in support of his contention proves the very contrary to what the honorable member claims. The leave of the House of Commons was being sought to introduce a measure relating to certain coercive measures which were taken in Ireland. Then a debate ensued on the protection of life and property in Ireland. That was something relevant to the Bill. </para>

          <para>In making a motion for leave Ito bring in a Bill, he may explain the object of the Bill, and give reasons for its introduction; but unless the motion be opposed, this is not the proper time for any lengthened debate upon its merits. When an important measure is offered by a Minister or other member, this opportunity is frequently taken for a full exposition of its character and objects; but otherwise, debate should be avoided at this stage, unless it be expected that the motion will be negatived, and that no future occasion will arise for discussion. </para>

I agree with <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> if I may say so, that every amendment must be relative to the motion, but one must first appreciate what the motion is. The motion is not for the first or second reading of the Bill, but is to decide whether the Bill will be received at all. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> does not state that not only must an amendment be relative to a motion, but relative also to the Bill which is the subject-matter of the motion. I submit that is not the position at all, and this particular right of Parliament has been asserted time and again in the most emphatic manner in the instances which the honorable -member for Bourke has brought before the House. To move that certain proposed legislation ought to be put on one side in order that other legislation may be introduced - is that a motion or an amendment which is relevant to the Bill which is sought to be introduced ? </para>

            <para>- I submit that is so, and the emphatic negations on the other side do not decide the matter. The honorable member for Indi has stated that the land legislation which was mentioned in the particular amendment sought in that case was cognate with, or relative to, the matter of the Protection to Life and Property Bill which was sought to. be introduced. That argument cannot stand for one moment. If the honorable member had not used it I should have said that it was absurd. But one cannot use such language in regard to the honorable member for Indi. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forster,</inline> in introducing the motion for leave to introduce that Bill, clearly set out that the object of that Bill was the protection of life and property.

I do not care whether or not those troubles arose out of the atrocious agrarian laws or the crimes that were committed. The question is whether the land laws had any &#34; relation to criminal laws for the protection of life and property. </para>

          <para>A farmer might be sitting with his wife and children around afire, or he might be in bed, and shots would be fired into the house, windows were broken, and damage was done to the furniture. Although the shots were not fired at the farmer he might be hit. </para>
          <para class="block">That was the sort of crime that was referred to. Would the Attorney-General argue in any Court of Law that the introduction of a land law was in any way relevant to the introduction of a law for the protection of life and property against such crime. The proposed Bill is not yet introduced, and it may be a considerable time before the Attorney-General is enabled to introduce a Bill of this miserable character. The question to be decided is not the relevancy to the subject-matter of the Bill, but the relevancy to the question as to whether the Bill should be introduced or kept out. In Canada, exactly the same principles are laid down. An instance is given in Bourinot&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parlia mentary Procedure and Practice,</inline> in which this matter was dealt with. On page 590 of the second edition, this passage occurs - </para>
          <para>Sometimes, however, a short discussion may  Arise  on some features of the Bill on the motion for its introduction, as there is no rule to prevent a debate. At this stage,  it  is within the right of any member to submit an amendment to the motion for leave, and even to alter the title of the proposed Bill, though such a course is very seldom followed. As in England, it is now a very rare thing for the House to refuse leave, . though, of course, it rests entirely in the discretion of the majority to do so. </para>

May before a Committee on Public Business on the 22nd March, 1878. These further instances also are plain. In volume, 107 of the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the House of Commons</inline> (1852), page 68, it is reported that the question of an amendment of the Militia Bill was before the House - </para>

          <para>And the Question being put, That the words &#34; and consolidate &#34; be there inserted :  - It was resolved in the affirmative. </para>

            <para>- The  Speaker  may give &#39; his decision, under the Standing Orders, as soon as a point of order has been raised, or he may allow the question to be debated as long as he has any doubt as to what his decision should be. The point involved is extremely important and I thought that by allowing some debate I might cause to be thrown upon it some additional light. I had already familiarized myself with almost every one of the quotations that were made this afternoon, and, as a matter of fact, I have a typed <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of them before me, but I thought some new ground might be broken.

The honorable member for Richmond this morning, referring to a quotation that I had made from a speech delivered by him, said that he had not spoken at Murwillumbah, as quoted by me. I desire to explain that I quoted from a report which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 10th February last, and which read as follows: - </para>
