            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - I wish to make a statement to the House regarding certain matters that have transpired since we last met. Yesterday, I waited upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General, and tendered to him the advice that he should grant a dissolution of the House of Representatives, in order that its members, together with those senators whose term expires on the 30th June next, might submit themselves forthwith to the electors. After consideration,  His Excellency  was pleased to accept that advice. The people are, therefore, to be asked immediately by whom they will be governed. It is the intention of the Government to apply to Parliament for such Supply as may be needed to carry us over the period of the elections, and to ask it to ratify the collections under the Tariff schedule, and to make such arrangements as in the opinion of the Government are necessary for taking the vote of the men atthe front, and for excluding from voting the alien enemies in our midst. Let me state briefly the reasons for the course which the Government has taken. When recently I introduced a motion to prolong the life of this Chamber and of the term of the retiring senators, I set out at considerable length the considerations for such a proposal. I showed that they arose out of- the circumstances in which we found ourselves.I stated that we had reached the gravest crisis of the war, that the danger to the Empire was so real and grave that no political differences should stand in the way of the united action necessary for our salvation. I made it clear that the war was creeping nearer and nearer to these shores. Since thenwe have had ample and dreadful proof - the nature of which </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am unable to disclose to the public - that that is so. I tell honorable members that the substance of a cablegram which has just been received is that, from this date, all sailings of transports and troopships from Australia are prohibited. </para>
          <para>Within a few hundredmiles of us, in the waters of the very ocean that lap these shores, two vessels have been lost during the past few days. Honorable members, armed with this knowledge, in addition to that which they can gain from the press, know something of the danger now menacing the Empire. I said, not only that this was the gravest crisis we had reached inthe war, but also that there was now assembling at the heart of the Empire a Conference which was to discuss matters of vital importance to the conduct of , the war, the future of Australia, and the destinyof that great Pacific Empire which, whether we will or not, must be our heritage or else a deadly. menace to our safety.I said that the people of Australia demanded that the Commonwealth should be represented at that Conference. Who amongst us will deny it ? I venture to say that if it were possible to gather the people of Australia together in one mighty concourse and put that question to them, there would be such a thunder of &#34;Ayes&#34; that those who ventured to raise their voices in opposition would not be heard. I said, further, that&#39; if Australia were to be represented at that Conference, it was necessary that the delegates should leave immediately. I may say now what I could not say then: they were to have left Melbourne to-night. I gave reasons why, in my opinion, the prolongation of the life of this Parliament until October next would be insufficient. Those reasons are set out in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Honorable members know them, the public may read them, and I need not repeat them. Honorable members know the position in this House. By a two to one majority, the motion for the prolongation of the life of this Parliament was approved by this Chamber. Honorable members know, too, and every man in this country knows, the circumstances in another place. Unhappily, ever since that day on which it was decided to take a referendum of the people on the question of whether there should or should not be compulsory service for oversea service, there has been a division between two sections of the Labour party, which has now.  become a permanent cleavage. Every one knows the real nature of that cleavage, which is not as to whether there should or should not be compulsory service for oversea service but whether there shall be government by the people through their representatives in Parliament, or government by people who do not sit in this place. The House - and the country know perfectly well the attitude of the Labour organizations, or most of them, towards those who have ventured to tread with me the path that I have taken. They know perfectly well that from the day on which, the junta spoke and declared that, -come what may, I waa tobe sacrificed, no reconciliation was possible without my downfall. My head upon the charger, and complete submission to their will, was to be, and still is, the price of their agreement .to any suggestion for a reconciliation. They know that from that day to this I have been pursued with a malignity which in the history of politics has never been excelled. I have borne all this with what fortitude I could command, and endeavoured to do that which I conceived to be right. I have fought this fight with all my. soul and strength. I have fought, as all men of the British race should fight when their country and the Empire is in deadly peril, without reservation of any sort or kind. </para>
          <para>The War Conference is one which calls for representation of an effective kind. It would be absurd to say that, if Australiais to be represented effectively, the Prime Minister must not be present. Every one knows that an effort was made, not only by myself <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> leader of the section which does me the honour to support me, but also by the Liberal section of the Government, to persuade honorable members on the - opposite Bide of the chamber to join us in a National Government. Had that invitation been accepted, we should then have been in the position of being a united people to-day. Unhappily our .efforts failed, but 1 the responsibility for that failure rests on honorable members opposite, and not on us. That was the position when I came down and tabled a motion for the prolongation of the life of Parliament. I put forward then, as strongly as I could, the case for prolongation. I pointed out what matters were to be decided at the Imperial Conference. Peace and War, the future of the Pacific, the White Australia policy, in fact, all things affecting the destiny, present and future, of Australia. Will any man say that at such a Conference Australia could afford to be unrepresented <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Can he say ib fairly f Can he say that any of the differences that divide us can justify our abstention from effective representation at this great Conference! Certainly no man who pretends to call himself an Australian can do so. I pleaded to this House and through this House - I am unable to speak in another place - to this Parliament that it should grant this prolongation in order that the whole energies of the people might be concentrated on a Win-the-War policy, that Australia might be effectively represented at the War Conference. . Now, how do we stand to-day? The Government find themselves in a position, not only intolerable, but also impossible. United action is hopeless with a Parliament constituted as is this one. We must put an end to this intolerable state of things. The people must speak.. Words which I used on the 23rd February, and which are recorded on page 10635 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> are peculiarly appropriate today. I said - </para>
          <para>I have shown that united action is imperatively needed, and that the holding of an election would be fatal to it ; and  I  nope that  I  have made it clear, too, that, although an election is most undesirable, yet, if we are to tread that path, we must do so at once. </para>
          <para>I pointed out the only two courses before honorable members of this House and this Parliament. The sinking of party issues in order to bring about united action; or, an immediate election. The first is clearly impossible; the second inevitable. It is abundantly clear that no delegation can leave these shores in face of such tactics as are resorted to by honorable members opposite. It is abundantly clear that there is only one way out of this tangle - only one way in which Australia can say to the Empire what it is going to do; only one way by which Australia can demonstrate to the world whether it is weary of the war and of the burden of Empire - whether it is going to prove itself worthy or degenerate in this great hour of struggle and strife; only one way by which it can declare whether it is resolved to abandon the Empire and destroy itself - and that is by an appeal to the electors. That appeal we  propose to make forthwith. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> confess that if I had had my way - if, since the 28th October, I had been in command of a united party, with a majority at my back - we should - if attempts at reconciliation had failed -have been to the country, and come back three months ago. Every man amongst those who follow me knows this to be a fact. But, sir, I was not so situated. And, when this great War Conference was proposed, I was, like other men, compelled to recognise its overwhelming importance. Confronted with the necessity for effective representation in such a conclave, all other things seemed to be dwarfed. I hoped that honorable members opposite would abandon - for the time being, at all events - their virulent attacks on myself, and would look at the position no longer in a party, but in a national, spirit. I hoped against hope, because I knew that there were no men in this House who, in their hearts, longed so earnestly as did those honorable gentlemen for the prolongation of Parliament. I confess I did not believe that the junta could force them to the point of voting against it; for I know full well how earnestly they yearned that the bitter cup of an election might pass away. I thought, as my honorable friend the honorable member for Barrier reminded me, that these honorable gentlemen, who had charged me with that very mission - this sacred mission, &#34; In God&#39;s name, go to the British Government and get them to agree to a prolongation of the life of this Parliament&#34; - would not have yielded to the junta in a matter on which they felt so strongly. But they have lost all power of volition; they speak and act only as they are directed. Do my honorable friends deny that they did beg of me to ask the British Government to prolong the life of this Parliament? They cannot deny it. It does not depend on their word. There are in this party behind me twenty-five men who know it to be a. fact. Those men were in the party room, and heard it a hundred times. I had hoped, I say. therefore, that we should see the end of these hypocritical protestations, this posturing before the people and before the junta, that the appeal to the British Government was a constitutional crime that had, as it were, turned their very bowels around in anguish at this sacrilegious attack upon the rights of self-government. </para>
          <para>Why, this was the very motive that made them bid me God-speed to England. Honorable members opposite cannot deny this. It does not depend on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> says or on what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> says. It depends on the testimony of twentyfive men who stand with me, and there are men opposite who will not deny it. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members opposite cannot deny what I have said. It is as clear as Holy Writ. They cannot deny that even the Labour party, in their anxiety to prevent an appeal by honorable senators alone, unsupported by members of their organization in the lower House, saw, through the dark clouds of the referendum vote, that such an appeal meant ruin. They were willing, therefore, to postpone the election for the Senate until October. They will not deny, either, that the only way in which an election could have been postponed was by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. This completely disposes of that part of the case. We have done what we could to promote and secure united action. We have done what we could to take the part that is right in the cause of the Empire, to follow the lead set by Great Britain herself, by Canada, and by other overseas Dominions to have no election during the war. But these gentlemen will not let us follow that lead. They care nothing for the Empire. </para>

On the one hand, is the Empire locked in a life-and-death struggle imperatively demanding united action, and on the other, the narrow party outlook of the Labour organizations, animated by bitter personal animosity towards myself. I ask this House and the country to contrast these -two things - the infinitely great and vital and the infinitely little and petty. I ask the country to judge between us, and to decide by whom they will be governed. The Government, having reviewed all the circumstances, and having considered their position in another place, where they could have held on only under sufferance, even if they passed the resolution which they had every right to believe they could do, and which, if .all their supporters had voted for it, they certainly could do- </para>

              <para>- If all the supporters of the Government voted for the motion they could have passed it. We have a right on the face of things to say that the Government have a majority in another place. But in what circumstances would the Australian delegation to the Imperial War Conference leave these shores? In the face of the statement by an honorable senator in another place, and by honorable members here, what position would the delegation and the Government have been in ? Probably before the delegation had sailed out of Australian waters there would have been a political crisis, and an. election of the Senate, or possibly of both Houses. In all the circumstances, therefore, the Government considered that, after the charges were made which have been heard in this House and in the Senate touching the honour of the Government, and the honour of this Parliament, there is one course, and one course only, to pursue, and that is to send this Parliament to its masters - to get from the people that imprimatur of their approval which would place them in a position to carry out their policy, to enable Australia to do its duty during the war and present to the world a united front. So we are going to the people. </para>

I shall not take up much time of honorable members, because the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in another place completely cover the ground. I have here a report of a speech made by the Leader of the Government in another place after he had listened to a further statement of the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> The charges themselves are set out inHansard, and are available to the country. Most, if not all, of them have already been set out in the press. I say that no man can rise from their perusal without a feeling of amazement that a gentleman whose honour had been impugned, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> says his was, should have gone again and again to the fountain which, polluted him, should drink from it to repletion again and again, and yet, going to this polluted fountain, should, on his own showing, believe that he was drinking in the waters of life. He said, in effect, &#34;I went to these gentlemen as friends. I took their advice as friendly advice. I knew that they were giving me friendly advice.

I do not know how many times he saw the Minister, or what intervals elapsed between each conversation with him. But certainly he saw him several times, and intervals, more or less lengthy, took place between these interviews.

              <para>- I can say that, on that particular afternoon, I was, as often I am, exceedingly busy, and he sat in one of my ante-rooms for an hour. Why? I will not swear to an hour, but he sat there waiting patiently for me to see him longer than I would sit waiting for any man on God&#39;s earth. I have nothing more to say about what happened, except to again reiterate what I said in reply to the honorable member for Yarra on Friday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> stated yesterday that he knew I was speaking to him as a friend. Yet, he says, I attempted to bribe him. How does he explain these numerous interviews with the  President  of the Senate, with the Minister for Defence, and with myself, the lengthy interval that elapsed from his first interview with the  President  until his interviewwith me? How does he explain the inexplicable interval between the interview with me and the date of his statement in the Senate? For these things are surely inexplicable if an attempt were made to corrupt him. Perhaps the trouble is that I did not attempt to do so. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Yarra took me by surprise on Friday. He knows perfectly well that I have a hundred things to do, and I could not recall on the spur of the moment all that had occurred in connexion with this matter. My mind is charged with many things. Even the key to the whole situation of the prolongation of Parliament had slipped from my memory until the honorable member for Barrier reminded me that I was sent to England to get a prolongation of the life of Parliament. Some of the circumstances connected with this interview have since returned to my mind. Yesterday&#39;s proceedings in another place throw much light on this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> stated that he went to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on Militarymatters. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline>The honorable senator sent for me. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>The honorable senator came to me to talk about defence matters.  His  statement to-day on this point is quite correct. On the occasion referred to we did talk over the case which the honorable senator has mentioned. Then I proceeded to talk over this other matter, on which T had previously conversed with the honorable senator, not once, but two or three times. When I again, on this occasion, broached the subject, did this gentleman with the high sense of honour and the tender conscience rush away from me as from a person of evil disposition? Did he say to nic, &#34;I must leave you; you will contaminate me&#34;? Did the honorable senator rush across to the other side of the chamber to escape my evil influence? No, he remained and discussed the question with me. When, as a result of that conversation, I formed the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> wanted to come with us, I sent him the telegram which has been referred to in order that he might meet the Prime Minister in Sydney. When that visit of the Prime Minister to Sydney was cancelled, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> met me again, I put the proposition before him that ho should go and see the Prime Minister on &#39;the matter we had been discussing. Did the honorable senator then, with his high sense of honour, scout that proposition ? Not at all. Not only did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> go willingly to see the Prime Minister, but he went after consultation. He tells us to-day that he asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> to come into a room, and that by themselves they talked the matter over. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline>That was after I had seen the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline>I understood the honorable senator to say that he consulted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> before he went to see the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline>No, I told <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator McDougall,</inline> in the club-room, that I had been asked* by you to go and see the Prime Minister, and that I would go and see him. When I came back I took occasion to call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> into a room and told him what took place. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline>I accept the honorable senator&#39;s statement. He informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that he had been sent for, no doubt in doing so telling the honorable senator why he had been sent for. Then he goes to the Prime Minister, the arch-tempter of all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> the unsuspecting, the innocent, this virgin of honour, goes to place himself in the awful presence of the arch-tempter of all. Having had this great .temptation placed before him, the honorable senator comes back. Does he reject the temptation?  Does he announce to the world that he had been tempted, and denounce the tempter? Not at all. In .the secret recess of some room in Parliament House  he  discusses the question with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> Then, honorable senators should bear in mind that nothing happened even after that conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> Time goes by, and it is not until the third degree has been applied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> by the Caucus that he comes down here and makes his statement. When, after all this, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> comes before us and speaks about his conscience and his high ideals of honour, there is some reason to doubt the valuation put upon these virtues of the honorable senator by himself, and also the value which the public will be likely to put upon them. </para>
          <para class="block">I want - because -&#39;this matter reflects very seriously on us all - Fo direct the attention of the House for a few moments to a report which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, and which was quoted by my honorable colleague in another place yesterday.

It would have spoiled their tactics for the election. That is what it would have spoiled; and tactics before the election are far more to these  high-souled  gentlemen than is any question of bringing a criminal to justice.

Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> was wise to reserve his revelations till something occurred to support his statement, and the result, he believed, would be to secure for Labour a number of Liberal votes that never came their way before. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is perfectly clear that the gentleman who says that an attempt was made to bribe him never did anything at all to cleanse his soiled honour - that literally for weeks he went to one man after another listening to what they said, accepting their advice as friends, and that finally the Caucus got hold of him by the scruff of the neck and said to him, &#34;If you do not come up to the scratch and do this - then ! Anathema - you will be struck off the ticket.&#34; What did he say to me? He said, &#34;I cannot live in Newcastle unless I am a member of the Official Labour party.&#34; He does not deny that if he followed his convictions he would have joined my party. Therefore, the only reason why he makes this charge is to save his skin. What can any man think of such a charge from such a man ? I have only one thing to say about him and his charge : I have instructed my solicitor to issue a writ against him. That writ will be out this afternoon. It is returnable in the Supreme Court of this State. Unless he pleads privilege, he must defend it; he must do so publicly ; he must take the consequences of his charge; he cannot, and shall not, be allowed to make such charges for party purposes. The Courts can and shall judge between him and me; it will be for him to make out his case. If honorable members opposite will muster up enough courage to make any other definite charge where the plea of privilege will not shelter them, this Government - I, or any member of it, or. I assume, any member of this party - will take similar action. We are going to appeal to the great jury of the people of this country, and the Courts of this country can investigate these charges. But the gentlemen who have made them can never escape the stigma now indelibly branded on their foreheads. They have failed their country in its hour of trial. In the gravest crisis in our history, they have put the selfish and narrow interests of party before the welfare, the safety, of the Commonwealth and Empire. They have feared to lose their seats. Moved by that fear, they have sacrificed the best interests of their country at the bidding of men outside this Parliament, who exercise a reign of terror over them. They dare not stand up and say what they think. What have I done that they should pursue me with such bitterness? I have still hung on the walls of the little room that I dignify by the name of study in my house a testimonial signed by the secretary of the Australian Workers Union, and by a man on the other side of this chamber - the honorable member for Cook - which speaks of my many virtues, of the things I have done for unionism and labour. When the howling storms of invective burst more loudly than usual on my ears, I sometimes look at this and wonder : I ask, what have the honorable member for Darling - I select him as a type of the men who stand with me - and myself done that we should be thus reviled and slandered? What have we done? We had the courage to face the unions and political organizations of this country, even though it meant our expulsion from them. I, like him, have cut myself aloof from organizations built up by the unremitting and painful work of many years; of a lifetime. No money could buy the services which I have given to the trade unions of this country. I have gone into this hell, in which I now pass my days - why ? Because I believed the course which I had mapped out for myself to be the right course. I could have taken the easy way. I could have hung on to power and postured as a patriot, but taking no risks. I could have kept a smooth face and ridden in peace and security, but I could not have ridden in honour. Now these gentlemen, having failed to unhorse me in the arena in fair combat, attempt to assassinate me. I go to the people. Let my opponents do what they can. The people are to judge between them and us by whom they are to be governed. Upon their decision the future of Australia depends. By whom are we to be governed if not by those who have the courage to put the nation before their part,v ? I  say  to the people of this  country  : &#34; And this I have tried to do, and ask to be judged accordingly.&#34; </para>
          <para>The gentlemen who have been clamouring for an election have got what they have asked for. It is now for them to make good their case. There is now provided the jury to which we shall appeal on all matters. There is no escape. Those who are guilty must be condemned and will pass out of political life. But these gentlemen shall not use these tactics to bring this country down. They shall not use these tactics as a sort of shield behind which they can crouch. If they get in, they must get in on their policy. And what is their policy? Apart from their detestation and hatred of me, what is it? I have done. All I have to add is that honorable members will prove that they are ready to go to&#39; the country by granting us, without hesitation or delay, that amount of Supply necessary to carry the Government over the period to be covered by the elections and until we  get back again; to pass the Bill necessary to ratify the collection of the Customs duties under the present Tariff; to give us an opportunity of enabling the soldiers of Australia to cast their votes; and to give us whatever legislation may be necessary - if necessary at all - to prevent alien enemies in our midst from striking a blow for Germany on the side of our political foes. </para>

              <para>- I shall proceed in my own way, and without dictation from the honorable member for Wannon or any one else. Now, I want to say that the speech made by the Prime Minister was not delivered for this House at all. We are all well aware of that. It was an electioneering speech, intended for the country, as were the other two speeches which have been made by the Prime&#39;Minister recently. These speeches will be printed for circulation throughout the country. The remarks just &#39;made by the Prime Minister are as remarkable for the omissions as for the statements contained in them. When, on the strength of the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> lastweek, we asked for a Royal Commission or some inquiry, it was turned down and not one word has been uttered by the. Prime Minister to indicate whether there is to be any public inquiry into this matter at all. I know that some people will believe the Prime Minister, and, on the other hand, there are others who will believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> It is quite possible that neither will be right, and after all, that is not the proper way to have a trial of such an important matter. I do not know whether the honorable member for Flinders occupies the highest position in his profession or not, but I am quite satisfied that he and all the other legal gentlemen of standing would not think of trying a case of this nature merely on the strength of a statement on one side and a denial on the other, and without further independent inquiry. There is a proper way to ascertain whether the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> were accurate or nob. The Prime Minister says there is not. one word of truth in the statements, and he tells us that the Government are determined to appeal to the people. He gives no other reason now for an election. I admit that </para>

          <para>Ave  have asked for an election, and it is quite possible that the events connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> statement, as &#39;well as the peculiar circumstances surrounding the resignation of another honorable gentleman, may be mentioned during the coming campaign. But an election will not prove the truth or the falsity of the charges made. ^Neither will an election prove the truth or otherwise of the rumours now going round this city that the senator who resigned on account of illness was in a Minister&#39;s office on the very morning of the day on which he resigned. People who were passing in the streets of the city - people who know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> and know also the buildings in the city - saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> go into a Minister&#39;s office at a certain time and also saw him leave at a certain time. We know of the circumstances leading up to that resignation; but has the Prime Minister said a word to indicate that we were to have an inquiry into this matter ? Not a single word. What is the reason of this alteration in the policy of the Government? Last Friday afternoon, when a resolution was carried in this House, the question was raised, whilst a division was being taken, whether we would meet again today or yesterday. The Government said : &#34; Give us the division on the motion for the prolongation of the life of Parliament and we need nob meet till Tuesday.&#34; Has something happened elsewhere - not in the Senate - but has anything happened to two honorable senators? Did they practically give the Government notice to quit? Did they advise the Government that they were going to vote in a certain direction on that question ? No doubt the Prime Minister and honorable members on that side will go about the country during the forthcoming campaign saying that we, the members on this side, prevented Australia being represented at the Imperial Conference, and prevented the delegates leaving tonight, as the Prime Minister said they intended to do. But have honorable members forgotten that the Prime Minister said a few moments before that the state of affairs to-day was such that the Government were confidentially advised that no transport or troopship was to leave Australia ? How were these gentlemen to get away ? . It is an open secret that they were going on a transport or troopship. </para>

              <para>- How could they if the steamers are not going ? The Prime Minister said that sufficient Supply was to be asked for to carry the Government over the election. Does he mean that we are to pass sufficient Supply to cover the rest of .the financial year, and that we are to be asked before we adjourn to put through the whole of the Estimates without practically a line of them being discussed? He was so concerned in quoting from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proof of an honorable senator&#39;s speech that he did not matta that point clear. In the sixteen years I have been here I have never had a senator&#39;s proof in my hand on the day it should be corrected, and have never before known one to be quoted from. Yet the Prime Minister had one within a few minutes of the time allowed for corrections to be sent in. Had any honorable member on this side cared to object to the honorable gentleman reading that speech he could have been prevented, bub we were anxious to give him the greatest latitude on this question. He was  quite prepared to quote at length on that matter, but he uttered not a word as to the period of Supply to be granted, or as to how the Government propose to deal with the Tariff. He did not tell us, either, whether we were to be asked to pass a motion putting the whole of the Tariff through without any alteration. </para>

              <para>- It may or may not. I know of several items, from my intimate connexion with the Customs Department over a number of years, which need amendment. It shows that the Tariff schedule was fairly well prepared when it has been in existence for two years and four months, and so few anomalies have been found in it. I would urge the Government that where anomalies have been found, and the House can agree to make alterations practically without discussion, especially where obvious mistakes have been made, it should be done, for we have no right to allow an obvious mistake to remain in the Tariff schedule a moment longer than is necessary. We have no right to penalize the people. I can give one case. </para>

              <para>- I have no intention to name other anomalies, but am quite prepared to advise honorable members as to what I think is the best course to pursue. I will do this without any idea of gaining a party advantage. It was the honorable member for Grey who interjected that cornsacks represented one of the items which needed altering. The Prime Minister, while he went at length into private and semi-private matters, and quoted speeches, gave us no lead as to the intentions of the Government regarding some of the important legislation that we are to deal with before the dissolution. We have a right, in a studied, deliberate statement from the Prime Minister, to learn what action the Government propose to take. He did not say a word as to the inquiry we have demanded. What do the Government propose to do about it? Do they propose to pass over the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> and the circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready?</inline> It is well known to certain citizens of Melbourne, who knew <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> by sight that he was seen going into the office of a Minister of the Crown on the day that he resigned, and that he remained there for some time. </para>

              <para>- The Supreme Court will deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> case alone. I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> case is referred to in the action that the  President  of the Senate is bringing against the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> I understand that all that is referred to in that case is the alleged interview that took place between the  President  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson.</inline> I have been careful all through this matter to put it as if the thing is still <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and as if we were going to have an inquiry. But if the Government burke that  inquiry  the responsibility will be on every man sitting on that side of the House supporting the Government, and not on the men who are asking for it. The Prime Minister told the House that he waited on  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, and that the people are to be asked to say who shall govern. What caused the Prime Minister to arrive at that decision ? Is it a fact that the Government were informed that they had no possible chance of getting the motion for eN tending the life of the Parliament put through the Senate, and if they did not get an extension, then, of course, onehalf of the senators would go to the country. As the Prime Minister himself said, using language which will be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard, &#34;</inline> I will grant you a Royal Commission, or any inquiry you like, and, by God! if you want an election you can have an election too.&#34; He said, &#34; I am always looking for fight.&#34; The man who goes out looking for fight gets it, too, as a rule. </para>

              <para>- I think that the Prime Minister made out that he did not mind going out, and looking for a bit of fight. We are prepared to go, but the people will not be in a position to judge so well as they would if they had an inquiry into the unsavoury matters which have been brought up. Take the last case, namely, the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> What was the Prime Minister&#39;s statement last week in this Chamber when I quoted to him the telegram in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> stating that the Premier of Tasmania had been called on a mysterious errand to New South Wales, that while he was away at Swansea, on the east coast of Tasmania, a message was received from the Prime Minister to meet him in Sydney on the following Monday? The telegram went on to say that no one was aware of the nature of the business on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> was called to Sydney. The telegram was sent to Swansea on Friday, 23rd February, and five days after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was taken ill. To make the matter perfectly plain, five days before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is alleged to have fainted in the diningroom the Premier of Tasmania was called to New South Wales, and the Prime Minister, trying to get out of the dilemma, said, &#34; We heard that a resignation- </para>

            <para>Hobart. - Some mystery surrounds the hurried departure of the Premier for Sydney by the <inline font-style="italic">Moeraki</inline> early on Saturday morning. On Friday an urgent message was received from the Prime Minister asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> to meet him in Sydney on Monday morning. The Premier was at Swansea completing his eastern tour, and the message was repeated to bini there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee</inline> at once came on to Hobart, reaching the city about 1 a.m., and leaving at 10 a.m. for Sydney. The message contained no inkling of the business necessitating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lee&#39;s</inline> visit to New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- &#34; Insinuate !&#34; Honorable members on the other side are the last persons on this earth who should talk about insinuations. Five days before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was taken ill in the diningroom the Premier of Tasmania was wired for to go to New South Wales, and on Friday the Prime Minister said here, &#34; We heard.&#34; He did not forget this incident as he alleges he forgot the main question on which he visited England. He told honorable members who voted for him to go to England to attend the Imperial Conference that the main thing on which he visited England last year was to get an extension of the life of this Parliament, and that in making his speech, he forgot all about it. He did not forget last Friday, when he said, &#34; We heard that a senator was going to resign, and that it would be from a certain  State, and we got everything in readiness for his successor.&#34; Why? We are told that the successor was in Melbourne before the senator resigned. Either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> resigned by telegraph to his own State, or he left his resignation there. It is a certainty that one thing or the other took place.- I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> leaves Tasmania on Tuesday and Friday, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> left there on a Tuesday afternoon, the day before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> was taken ill, to come over here on other business.

              <para>- He hopped from the Tasmanian Assembly into the Senate. That is the position, and we are asked to believe it. There are plenty of persons outside who will not believe it; who will believe that something - I will not say crooked - of a doubtful character has been done. We are told by the Prime Minister that alien enemies are not to be allowed to vote. I personally am in accord with that proposal. Alien enemies ought to be interned, and no interned man has a right to vote. If a man is an enemy of our country, and the countries with which we are fighting side by side, he has no right to be out of the internment camp. Let Ministers take the responsibility. There are some men, however, born in what are enemy countries to-day who are not alien enemies. Some of them are as good Australians as any one else, and many of them have sons fighting on our side to-day. If we are to say that alien enemies must not vote, does it mean that we are to go a step farther and say that no alien enemy - I presume that the Prime Minister puts them all in the same category - shall sit in any Parliament in Australia? That is the natural corollary to his statement. </para>

          <para>His speech to-day is more notable for the omissions than for the things which it contains. He referred to the gravity of the crisis. We are all well aware of that. No honorable member on this side minimizes that position, but we do say that the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the delegation to the Imperial Conference is not satisfactory. If, the Prime Minister said, the people of Australia could have been got into one meeting to vote on the question as to whether or not Australia should be represented at the Conference, they would have voted that they should be represented. I am sure that they would, but they would not vote to be represented by the three honorable gentlemen who were selected. They would not vote to be represented by the honorable member for Flinders, not by a Minister who said that he would not agree to abide by the decision of the people given on the 28th October last. Is he to go to England to do, as he said he would, his utmost to have that decision upset, to go behind it? </para>

              <para>- News about the doings of party meetings always leaks out, no matter what the party, and during the luncheon hour, before the meeting  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> party, I had heard of it. I was sitting at a table upstairs, and, as honorable members know, one sometimes overhears what goes on round about. I overheard the Whip of the Hughes party calling together the members of that party for a meeting to consider the resolution of  the Liberal party. The Hughes party trooped in behind the Liberal party, and then  sent  an invitation to me as Leader of the Labour party. </para>

              <para>- The statement that the invitation to form a War Ministry came from the Liberal party  toi  the Hughes party and then to me apparently touches some honorable members on the raw.So much has been made of the fact that the Labour party declined the invitation to join with the other parties that I propose to place on record the letters which I received inviting me to a conference. The first letter came from the Leader of the Opposition. It is as follows: - 10th January, 1917. </para>

              <para>- Parliament met on the 8th February. We met on the afternoon&#39; of the 7th February. The Prime Minister said in his letter that no proposals had been agreed upon before the conference met which fixed up the present arrangement, but he is reported in the press to have said that he and the right honorable member for Parramatta had been in complete agreement for a long while, and that there was no alteration in regard to their proposals. If there were no proposals, how could they have been in complete agreement on them ? I have placed these communications on record - I also acknowledged the receipt of the letter from the right honorable member for  Pararmatta,  but there is no need to include that document - in order to point out that the Ministerial party of thirteen acted on the suggestion of the Liberal party. They did not hold their meeting until the Liberal party had sent their resolution to them. I received the letter from the Leader of the Liberal party before I received the invitation from the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para class="block">When the Prime Minister says to-day that the people outside will interpret the decision of the people at the forthcoming election as, perhaps, an intimation  that Australia  intends  to turn and quit, I answer him in those words of his own. If the people of Australia turn out the Government, it will be an intimation, not that Australia intends to turn and quit, but that it is not satisfied with the way in which Ministers have been administering the affairs of the country. The Prime Minister claims that animosity towards himself has been the cause of recent happenings, but I defy him to find a single utterance of mine, during the referendum campaign or  at any other time, which showed that I was actuated by any animosity towards him. -One complaint against me during that campaign was that I did not attack the Prime Minister. I- was fighting for a principle, and did nob attack individuals. </para>

              <para>- There is no minute in the party minute-book on the question to which I am referring, but I have a pretty fair memory, and I believe that the Prime Minister volunteered to go to the leagues&#39;. The right honorable gentleman knew perfectly well that, even &#39; if  the leagues had given us a free hand, it was my intention to oppose conscription, simply because I do not believe in it. I fancy I was one of the first of the party to speak to the Prime Minister on the question, and I said I would not sit. in any Government that either introduced a Referendum Bill or issued a proclamation. My attitude on conscription was perfectly plain. If the leagues had said that conscription had to be supported, I should have walked out of public life - &#34;make no bones&#34; about that; though, of course, in this regard I may be differently constituted from some men. At any rate, my memory tells me that the Prime Minister volunteered to interview the leagues, and he had a perfect right, of course, to hia own opinion if he thought it important that his side of the question should be put to them. According to the statement laid before us, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that he had broached the question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> on several occasions, and added that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had the &#34;third degree&#34; applied to him in caucus he was compelled to make a statement in the Senate. I desire to say that, when we were told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had resigned last Thursday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> got up voluntarily in the party room and told us the circumstances  as affecting himself. Thala was an ordinary urgency meeting such as is often held in the dinner hour by the party in times of crisis, and the meeting to which I refer was called in consequence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation. UP to that time I had not heard a whisper of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> having been, approached, and knew nothing of it until he there made Iiib statement. I fancy, further, that all the members of the party were in a similar position to myself, with the exception of, perhaps, three to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had spoken. No resolution was passed ab the party meeting calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to- make a statement in the Senate; but any honest man, as a representative of the people, when he knew another had been approached by several, would think ib due to the honour of Parliament to make the fact public. It is the feeling of members of the Labour party that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> made his statement on the first possible occasion. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member said &#34;the offence&#34;; and if I had his skill jat cross-examination, such as he showed in the Home Affairs inquiry, I could use ib with effect how. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> thought that, as he had declined the proposal of the Prime Minister to go over to the other side, it was not right to make a statement then, but when he found another man had been drawn in, and had been compelled to resign, he felt in honour bound to disclose the facts. Never in the whole of my political career have I known a more honorable man than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> or one whose word I would more readily believe. I guarantee that the people of Newcastle would sooner believe the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> than they would believe some other people on their oath. Some honorable members opposite tell us that we have no right to take our present action because they have been connected with the trade union movement for twenty-five years. But what about men on this side who have been connected with trade unionism for an equally long period, and who, in spite of their constant work for the movement, have never had a seat in Parliament? </para>

              <para>- Is that the reason why honorable members have gone over to the Government side? When any representative of the party fails in those things for which he has been elected, it is right that the people outside should seek to replace him by another to uphold the principles in which they believe. It is suggested that some honorable members on this side needed help in order to win their seats ; and it is a fact that very few of us have got into Parliament at the first time of asking; and, probably, all of us, on both sides, have received much assistance from our various party organizations. No man gets into Parliament without .the assistance of organizations; but some people, when they do get here, develop &#34; swelled &#39;head,&#34; with an idea that &#34; alone I did it.&#34; This they must get out of their mind; they must not think that because others do not realize their importance so much as they themselves do, people have no right to attempt to enter Parliament. The Prime Minister has told us of something that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is alleged to have said. I know, however, that no press man is allowed into any Labour League meeting in Victoria. Resolutions carried at meetings of Labour leagues and Labour Conferences that the press are not to be admitted to Labour League meetings have been in operation for years. Yet the Prime Minister, knowing that, accepts a statement that appears in the press as a report of remarks made by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports at a Labour League meeting. It is a faked report, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will no doubt be able to deal with it. I am merely now directing attention to the fact that the Prime Minister, knowing the practice of Labour Leagues in this respect, has assumed that the alleged report of the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, appearing in the press, is correct. </para>

              <para>- I say that the report was faked, if not by the man who sent it to the press, then by the person from whom that man obtained it. In their anxiety to secure information representatives of the press very often go from one person to another to learn what has been done at a particular meeting. This is not the first time that the press have published incorrect reports of the proceedings of meetings. Personally I welcome the opportunity to appeal to the people. If, as a result of that appeal, it is shown that honorable members opposite possess the confidence of the country, they will be in a better position to carry on the Government than they are in at the present time, when it is believed that many of them do not enjoy the confidence of the people. We have been asked by the Prime Minister to say what policy we intend to put before the country. I believe that it will be precisely the policy and platform upon which he was himself elected at the last election. That is the policy which we shall place before the people, and I am inclined to believe that it will not be found to differ very much from the policy which, on this occasion, will be placed before them by honorable members opposite. What was the reason for the break-away of the supporters of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> from the Labour party? It was that they contended that conscription was essential. </para>

              <para>- It is suggested by the Postmaster-General that I have not had much experience outside my own electorate, but I have not the slightest doubt that, had I been with honorable members on the other side during the recent campaign, the newspapers that denounced honorable members on this side would have pointed out that I, at any rate, am an international trade unionist, and have held office in trade unions in three continents. That is my experience outside the Yarra electorate; and the PostmasterGeneral can point to no such experience in the trade union movement. I can claim a more extended experience of the industrial movement than can many honorable members opposite. </para>

              <para>- Some of us, by the services we have rendered to the Labour movement, have made electoral contests in many electorates easier than they would otherwise have been for Labour candidates. We have done better work in this way than we could hope to do by breaking away from the principles in which we profess to believe. I welcome the appeal to the electors; but I trust it will not be made on the lines of the speech of the Prime Minister this afternoon. I hope that the elections will be fought fairly on principles, and that, before they take place, the Government will grant an inquiry so that the truth regarding the allegations of bribery and corruption  made  in another place, and the circumstances surrounding the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> may be set before the people by a competent tribunal. The matter should not be left to the decision of the electors. The electors who will vote for the honorable member for Henty, for instance, will do so, whether they believe that ex-Senator Ready was spirited away or not, and whether or not they believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> was offered money to leave his party. It is rumoured that there will be a successor to the honorable member for Kooyong, but, in the same way, I may say that the electors who will vote for the honorable member for Kooyong, or for his successor, will record a party vote, and will have noregard to the facts connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson&#39;s</inline> charges, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> resignation. This is why I say that the Government should, at the earliest moment, appoint a competent tribunal to inquire into those matters, so that the people may be in a position to pronounce judgment upon members of this Parliament when in possession of all that evidence upon these matters which can be secured by a competent tribunal. </para>

          <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. The Prime Minister, in his speech this afternoon, quoting from remarks made in another place, mentioned my name in connexion with an alleged report of a meeting which I attended last Saturday. I wish to say that the meeting I attended was a meeting of a branch connected with the Labour movement, to whose meetings the press are not admitted.. I could see every one whom T was addressing, and there was no reporter present, and no one took notes of what I said, and yet next* morning I saw in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper what purported, to be a report of my remarks. I at oncerung up the secretary of the branch, who* is on the telephone, and his wife answered the call. I asked her how on earth that sort of stuff got into the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> She said that I had better get some one else to speak to me on the matter. A man cameto the telephone, and I told him that morning, before the matter was referred to &#39;in the Senate, that I repudiated the report appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The moment I read the report, I could seethat whoever was responsible for it did not know what he was writing about. I am reported to have said - </para>

        <para>Any one who knows anything of these matters would know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> did not call his colleagues together, and that it was at an ordinary Caucus meeting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> mentioned the matter in question. I deny that I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> called his colleagues together in Caucus. I am reported later on to have referred to Senators Givens and Pearce, and the Prime Minister. I never mentioned the name of Senators Givens and Pearce at the meeting, but I did mention the Prime Minister. It is further stated that I said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had mentioned the matter - sooner than he did, it would have spoiled everything. </para>
        <para class="block">The insinuation contained in that was seized upon by the Minister for Defence in another place to suggest that everything was worked up splendidly, so that the grand announcement might finally be made.

            <para>- I have not denied it to the press; I have not bothered my head about the press. But I will make a statutory affirmation, and the branch secretary will do the same, that I rang him up and repudiated the report. I said to him: &#34;If I have to refute this report, I will  subpoena  you.&#34; It is evident that after the meeting some person gave to an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> agent some sort of a statement of what had occurred. Somebody asked in the course of the meeting why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> had not mentioned the attempted bribery earlier, and I replied that until the Ready incident occurred the Watson incident was useless ; the Ready incident was the connecting link. That is the nearest approach I made to the statement with which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> credits me. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> report is a garbled one, and was not written by a reporter, because there was none there. I can prove that I repudiated the report before attention had been drawn to it in the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I also desire to make a personal explanation. Speaking to the motion for adjournment moved by the honorable member for Echuca last week, I was referring to the licence granted for the local manufacture of aspirin, and, speaking from memory, I said that the name of the licensee was Harry Woolf Nicholas. I have since received a letter from the licensee, in which he states that his name is George Richard Rich Nicholas. In order to make myself clear to the House, I may say that the article produced by the licensee does not bear upon the label the name George Richard Rich Nicholas, but is declared to be manufactured by George R. Nicholas and Company. In the first place, the licence was granted to Shmith, Nicholas and Company, the partners in which were Harry Woolf Shmith, George Richard Rich Nicholas, Charles Shmith, Alfred Michael Nicholas, and Joseph Wilhelm Broady. I was evidently confusing in my memory George Rich Nicholas with Harry Woolf Shmith. I should like the Minister for the Navy to promise to look into the present shareholders in this company, and especially to ascertain if George Arnold, or Arnold^ who was  prevously  the agent for aspirin, is directly or indirectly interested in this company. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>A statement has appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> more than once, that last year a contract for the supply of &#163;3,000,000 worth of boots was offered to Australian manufacturers, and was afterwards withdrawn, owing to the lack of a guarantee that continuity of supply would not be interfered with by industrial disputes. I am in possession of information that the only contract ever offered was for &#163;500,000 worth of boots, and it was withdrawn, not on account of industrial trouble, but on account of the lack of material with which to make the boots. I ask the Prime Minister to investigate the statement made by the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and let the people know whether it is correct or not. </para>

            <para>- So far as I am aware, the order of public business was set out very clearly by the Prime Minister this afternoon. We do not propose to do anything more than we are compelled to do in the circumstances. That is a wellknown rule of procedure in circumstances such as the present. Supply will be necessary to carry us through the election, and we propose to ask the House to grant three months&#39; Supply, leaving all other financial considerations for the year to be dealt with on our return from the country. </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that would be too large an order, and would take us too long. The idea is to do just what we have to do in order to make the appeal to the country which has been decided upon. The next matter is the Tariff. I heard with some surprise this afternoon that the Leader of the Opposition had raised the question of cornsacks, and some other urgent matters. </para>

              <para>- I should very much prefer even technical alterations to stand over till later on. They can be raised just as well three months hence as now. Speaking from a prolonged experience of Tariff matters - and I suppose I have had as much to do with them as most men - I believe that any one who has had to do with Tariffs would eschew, as far as possible, the re-opening of these matters now, for the reasons I have given. That measure, and the one providing for taking the votes of soldiers at the front, are the only ones that I am aware of at the moment. Some other little matters may crop up, but, generally speaking, we propose to finish up here at the earliest possible moment, so that we may get to the country. </para>

            <para>- I am informed that over &#163;24,200,000 sterling has already been paid on account of the old Wheat Pool, which is nearly double the amount received for any former wheat harvest. There has not been any delay in making payments; and the date of the payment of the next dividend entirely depends upon the progress made in shipping the wheat. </para>

          <para class="block">I am asking honorable members for three months&#39; Supply to carry on the Government until a little after the end of May. We think that by that time the elections will be over, and that Parliament will be able to deal again with the question of Supply. There will be only about one more month of this financial year to run after this Supply has been granted. If there had been time, and the exigencies of the position had nob been such as they are, I would have preferred to bring down the Estimates. They are practically ready; but they could not be placed before honorable members in the form in which the Budget-papers have been generally submitted in less time than ten days. I therefore ask Parliament to grant three months&#39; Supply. The Appropriation Bill will be brought along after the new Parliament has been elected. </para>

              <para>- That will not matter, I think. We shall have to get through in the best way we can. If they give us three months&#39; Supply they will deal with the Appropriation Bill in the interval between the meeting of the new Parliament and the end of the financial year. I believe that an Appropriation Bill has been passed after the end of the financial year, but it is not a practice which I would like to follow if it could be avoided. Excluding the item for refunds of revenue this Bill appropriates &#163;3,698,652 to carry on the services of the country for the next three months. During the financial year Parliament has already granted Supply amounting to &#163;9,212,507, not including amounts made available under the Treasurer&#39;s Advance for refunds of revenue. These are respectively &#163;1,700,000 and &#163;270,000. The present Bill provides, with a few exceptions to be hereafter referred to, for expenditure for a period of three months based on the appropriations for the services for the year 1915-16, and at the rates then provided for. </para>

          <para>The item which shows by far the largest increase in expenditure compared with that of last year is &#34; War Pensions,&#34; the expenditure under that head for eleven mouths of this year being &#163;959,600 over the amount provided for the corresponding period of last year. This large increase is due to the regretably heavy casualties among our soldiers at the front, and the consequent increase in the number of pension claims. </para>
          <para>Another item which shows a considerable increase in expenditure is &#34; Trading vessels,&#34; for which the provision for this year exceeds that for the corresponding period of last year by &#163;327,000. Some vessels which were originally used as transports are now being used exclusively as cargo carriers. Their working expenses as transports were charged .to the vote for Expeditionary Forces; their expenses as cargo carriers are charged to the vote for trading vessels. </para>
          <para>The full annual training prescribed by the Defence Act for the members of the Citizen Forces has been resumed for the first time since the beginning of the war, which accounts for an increase of &#163;169,000; another large increase of &#163;104,000 for &#34;Other War Services&#34; being due to additional expenditure in connexion with interned enemy subjects, the erection of military hospitals, &#38;c. </para>
          <para>An increase of over &#163;60,000 is provided for in connexion with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, the working expenses of which have increased because of the increase in the length of line opened up for traffic. </para>
          <para>As against these increases there are considerable decreases in several items, totalling over &#163;300,000; being chiefly War Census, &#163;44,000; Maintenance of Naval Ships and Vessels, &#163;45,000 ; Naval Dockyards, &#163;93,000, and Interest and Sinking Fund and Loss of working in connexion with the Port Augusta railway, &#163;120,000.

As soon as I came into office - unexpectedly on this occasion I may say - I set about inquiring what were the financial obligations of the country. The Treasury officials have been compiling the information, which I now submit, to the Committee, as a general view of the Commonwealth finances. </para>
          <para>The outstanding features of the Estimates of 1916-17 are a great increase in revenue and a greater increase in expenditure. </para>

          <para>The increase in the interest and sinking fund on loans includes &#163;105,000 interest on loans raised for States. The increase of &#163;105,000 is set ofl by a similar amount to be paid to the Commonwealth bv the States, and included in the Estimates of Revenue. </para>
          <para>With regard to the increase in the cost of working the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, I may say that the estimated increase in revenue is &#163;52,590. </para>

          <para>Leaving war out of consideration, the Estimates of 1916-17 show the following position : - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="081331191703064_26_4.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>This leaves a balance of . . &#163;4,269,835 which, without the &#163;3,000,000 referred to hereunder, would not be sufficient to meet the estimated war expenditure necessarily payable from revenue, namely: - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="081331191703064_26_5.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>It is intended to pay the whole &#163;6,903,551 from revenue, and that is possible, because, from the year 1915-16 there was brought forward an amount of &#163;3,000,000 ear-marked for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions, which, altogether, will cost &#163;3.660,000 in 1916-17. The balance of &#163;4,269,S35 referred to above and the &#163;3,000,000 amount to &#163;7,269,835. After paying the &#163;6,903,551 out of that, a surplus of revenue amounting to &#163;366,284 will, apparently, remain at the end of the financial year. </para>
          <para>Although we can pay our way out of revenue during this year, owing to the &#163;3,000,000 brought forward from last year, there is really a deficit on the year&#39;s transactions of &#163;2,633,716, calculated as follows : - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="081331191703064_26_6.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>The position of the accounts is, therefore, very unsatisfactory. If we had not had that &#163;3,000,000 in trust funds for invalid and old-age pensions and other purposes, the real deficit would have been &#163;2,633,716. Expenditure has been incurred on most of the items provided for, and the savings which might have been made at the beginning of the year are not now possible. Much can be said in favour of all the expenditure, but, in a time like this, it is not a question of whether an object is desirable, but whether it can be done without. A policy of self-denial is required, and though the estimates of expenditure in 1916-17 have been considerably reduced, further immediate action is desirable to curtail expenditure, so that next year&#39;s finances may be relieved. Owing to the increase of interest, sinking fund, war tensions, &#38;c., it is not possible to provide out of the revenue of next year for the services which are now borne upon the revenue and which were previously chargeable to loan funds. It is useless our trying to pay out of revenue for works that we have been accustomed to pay for out of loan funds. The stringency that faced the honorable member for Capricornia and others who have preceded me at the Treasury was nothing compared with the stringency which now confronts me. </para>
          <para>I come now to the position of the revenue account in 1917-18. The position of the Treasury in each succeeding year of the war will be much worse than has been shown above, because the liability for interest, sinking fund, andwar pensions is rapidly increasing. &#34;We shall have to raise money for payment to the British Government of the cost of maintaining Australian troops abroad, and shall have to pay interest and sinking fund upon it from revenue. Our public debt, with its annual charges, will, therefore, be largely increased. </para>
          <para>The war expenditure from loan, including the liability to the British Government for maintenance of Australian troops abroad,amounts at present to something like &#163;80,000,000 per annum. Interest on this at 5 per cent., and sinking fund at 1 per cent., amount to &#163;4,800,000. For each additional year of war it may be calculated that, even if the number of troops be not increased, we shall require additional revenue to meet the following increased charges: - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="081331191703064_27_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">That is to say, for every year the war lasts revenue must be found to meet expenditure amounting to &#163;6,800,000 in addition to the amount of revenue which is being raised in 1916-17. </para>
          <para>The position in 1917-18 may be roughly set down as follows: - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="081331191703064_27_1.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>In this &#163;9,684,000 there is no provision for interest and sinking fund on any loans that may be raised for new Federal railways and other works. </para>

              <para>- I shall deal with that matter at a later stage. It would be unwise for any Treasurer to say what he is going to do in order to finance a year that has not arrived. I am dealing with the present year, and only forecasting what we shall require without laying down any rule as to how the money is to be obtained. This is a matter for the Treasurer at that time dealing with the finances of the then pending year. </para>

          <para>War Expenditure. The expenditure on war in 1916-17, not including interest, sinking fund, war pensions, &#38;c., which must be charged to revenue, is estimated at &#163;78,782,364. This includes &#163;750,000 to be lent to the States to enable them tq settle returned soldiers on the land. Also included is &#163;32,000,000, being the estimated amount payable to the British Government for the maintenance of Australian troops in the field. Of the &#163;32,000,000, arrangements have been made to pay &#163;8,500,000, which was due up to 30th June, 1916. It is proposed also to make arrangements to pay the remaining &#163;23,500,000, and this amount has been included in the annexed statement as part of the expenditure of 1916- 1917, during which the liability will accrue. </para>
          <para>The estimate of &#163;78,782,364 does not include any money for the repatriation of soldiers except the &#163;750,000 provided for settlement on the land. Other expenditure for repatriation is a responsibility of the Repatriation Fund Trustees. They have in hand &#163;304,000, which is more than sufficient to meet demands up to the end of 1916-17. </para>
          <para>The war expenditure of next year, 1917-18, may be roughly estimated at the same amount as in 1916-17. </para>

          <para>We have further agreed that the States may draw on the Commonwealth up to &#163;1,000,000; that is, for half the amount set out in the schedule up to the 30th June..... It has been decided, as a broad principle of policy, that these moneys are to be used exclusively for the purpose of land settlement under this scheme, and not for public works..  It is understood that the State of Queensland does not at present come into the scheme. It therefore follows that for the year 1917 the amount allocated amongst the other five States will be &#163;1,500,000. </para>
          <para>The assistance to be granted to returned soldiers, other than assistance towards land settlement, will be provided as it is required every year. For this purpose, the Repatriation Fund Trustees have received &#163;325,000, including &#163;250,000 paid out of Commonwealth Revenue in 1915-16. The expenditure to 31st January, 1917, has been &#163;21,000, leaving a present balance of &#163;304,000. </para>

The moneys referred to in the agreement are for the ordinary public works, &#38;c, of the States, and are not for the settlement of returned soldiers on the land, or for other repatriation purposes. </para>
          <para>In June, 1916, the Commonwealth raised &#163;4,000,000 in London at5&#188; per cent., the price obtained being par. That money, less expenses, has been handed to the States as part of that which the Commonwealth undertook in the agreement of 6th November, 1915, to raise. Loans cannot now be obtained in London without the consent of the British Government, which approved of the Commonwealth raising a further sum of &#163;3,500,000 for the States, but requested that we should not go on the market without further permission, which has not yet been given. At the same time, the Imperial Government informed us that, within the limit of &#163;3,500,000, the Commonwealth might advance money to the States out of war funds supplied by the British Government. Of that &#163;3,500,000 we have already advanced &#163;2,605,500 to the States out of war&#39; funds. We are awaiting permission from the British Government to raise the loan of &#163;3,500,000 in order to reimburse the advance of &#163;2,605,500 and to complete the payments to the States. </para>
          <para>On 17th January, 1917, a cablegram was sent to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asking what arrangements the British Treasury intends making to enable the Commonwealth to borrow the &#163;3,500,000. The British Treasury has also been asked for permission to raise the additional amount of &#163;1,440,000, which is required to makeup the full amount of &#163;8,940,000 included for 1916 in the agreement. </para>

        </para>
        <para>There is authority to borrow &#163;2,000,000 more from the Imperial Government, and that Government has agreed to lend this sum. </para>
        <para>The total amount authorized to be raised in the Commonwealth for war purposes is &#163;88,000,000. Of this amount, &#163;76,979,040 has been raised, leaving an amount of &#163;11,020,960 which may yet be raised. In computing these amounts, the proceeds of the fourth issue (which is still open for subscription) have been taken as &#163;18,246,580, though the subscriptions have already reached &#163;20,000,000. </para>
        <para>Purchase of Ships by Commonwealth. In June, 1916, the Prime Minister purchased a fleet of fifteen steamers, at a cost of &#163;2,052,476. The capital cost is being treated as an overdraft account at the Commonwealth Bank. It is not an overdraft in the ordinary sense of the term, because the Bank requires the Commonwealth Treasury to maintain at the credit of other accounts kept by the Treasury in the Bank a minimum credit balance corresponding to the amount of the overdraft. </para>
        <para>It is intended that all moneys earned by the ships shall be paid into the credit of the overdraft account, also that moneys required for meeting the expenses of the fleet shall be paid out of that account. That is to say, the overdraft will be from time to time reduced by the amount of the net earnings of the steamers. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that the excess of receipts over expenditure up to 30th June, 1917, will be &#163;500,000. If the estimate be realized, the overdraft account will at that date be. &#163;1,552,476. </para>
        <para>Legislation is required to cover the purchase of ships as well as to legalize the proposed method of accounting. </para>
        <para>Sugar. The refining, importation, and sale of sugar is controlled by the Commonwealth. Under the Sugar Purchase Act 1915 the Treasurer has power to borrow from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia moneys for the purchase of sugar by tha Commonwealth, and for the payment of Customs duty on sugar imported by the Commonwealth, but so that the indebtedness to the Bank shall not at any time exceed &#163;500,000. To date &#39;the only moneys charged to the account referred to are for the payment of duty .to the Customs Department. </para>
        <para>Under agreements with  the  Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited and the Millaquin Sugar Company Limited, those two companies handle the whole of the business. They purchase raw sugar, refine, and distribute it. The agreements provide for payment to .the companies &#39; at specified rates for their services. Apart from the charge to the overdraft account in the Commonwealth Bank in respect of Customs duty on imported sugar, the Commonwealth has not had to find any funds to carry on this business. </para>
        <para>Wheat. The Treasury is nob directly concerned in the Wheat Pool. Moneys for payment to the growers, in anticipation of the sale or shipment, are advanced by the British Government and the Australian banks. The moneys do not pass through the Treasury. </para>
        <para>Information recently supplied to the Treasury shows that the cash payments already made to farmers on account of last season may be taken as &#163;24,200,000. As the balance of the crop has now been disposed of,  further  payments of &#163;8,000,000 may be expected. This will give a total of over &#163;32,000,000, which the Australian Wheat Board will distribute to growers of the 1915-16 harvest. </para>
        <para>The present season 1916-17, though not so bountiful as the last, will, in all probability, be a year of unusual production. A. pool of at least 120,000,000 bushels is anticipated, and arrangements have been made to advance 2s. 6d. per bushel at country railway stations. These payments will absorb &#163;15,000,000. In addition, an amount of &#163;3,000,000 will be required to meet railway freights, handling charges, and&#39; other expenses. </para>
        <para>The recent sale of 3,000,000 tons. (112,000,000 bushels) effected by the Prime Minister to the Imperial Government has considerably eased the task of financing the new harvest. Payments are being spread from&#39; 1st February to 1st December, so that there should be excellent prospects of further payments being made this year, both to last season&#39;s and this season&#39;s growers.- </para>
        <para>The British Government has agreed to advance &#163;18,000,000 to the Pool, to be made available in nine equal weekly instalments,&#39; commencing 1st February, 1917, with interest adjustment when the payments from 1st February to 1st December fall due. </para>
        <para>Wool. The Imperial Government purchased the balance of the Australian wool clip for the season 1916-17. The price paid is ls. 3&#163;d. per lb., flab rate, all over the Commonwealth, on greasy wool basis. The Commonwealth Government is the sole agent for the Imperial Government. The Prime Minister is controlling the business. He delegates his duty to a Central Wool Committee of eight representatives of different departments of the wool industry. The Central Committee has assisting it a Committee in each State. Each State Committee has a subcommittee of six, representing sheepskin scouring and fellmongering industry. In addition to these bodies, tlie Central Wool Committee has an Advisory Board of the leading wool experts in the Commonwealth, to which technical matters are referred. All of these bodies are honorary. </para>
        <para>Finance is arranged by the Central Wool Committee with the Army Contracts Wool Committee in London. As soon as an appraisement has been completed, the figures are sent to the Central Wool Committee. That Committee cables to the Army Contracts Wool Committee in London, intimating that so much money is required to meet the appraisement. The money is then placed to the credit of the Central Wool Committee with the Commonwealth Bank in London. That institution transfers it to Australia as required. </para>
        <para>The grower sends his wool to one of the appraising centres, and the Commonwealth Bank in Australia, on instructions of the Central Committee, pay so much money to tlie wool-selling establishment, which divides it and hands it to the woolgrower. The value of the wool clip is estimated at from &#163;20,000,000 to &#163;22,000,000. In addition, there are the sheepskins. The Central Committee will begin appraising the sheepskins in the course of a week or so. The local fellmonger has the first opportunity of purchasing, so as to maintain the industry in Australia. The Imperial Government requires 4,000 bales per month of sheepskins. Should there be a surplus above the amount required by that Government, the Central Wool Committee will call for tenders for the purchase. The fellmongers have the call upon the sheepskins before the British Government can be supplied, and the same applies to wool in respect of local requirements. </para>
        <para>The following statements show the Commonwealth receipts and expenditure for 1915-16 and 1916-17 in some detail: - </para>

        </para>
        <para>The conclusion to be arrived at from the foregoing statements of the financial position of the Commonwealth is that, subject to the estimated revenue being secured, the requirements of the present year ending 30th June, 1917, are provided for, but an immense increase of revenue will be required for 1917-18 and succeeding years. I have shown that &#163;6,800,000 will be required next year, and succeeding years, in addition to the revenue which is being raised this year, and that does not provide for any expenditure from loans on the railways and public works of the Commonwealth. The manner in which that increased revenue will be raised I have not disclosed in this  review. It would be very unwise to reveal how the business of this country is to be financed during the next financial year. It will be dealt with at the proper time by the Treasurer of the day. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. Does the honorable member expect me to blazon forth that the Tariff is to be increased in some particular? He must have some consideration for those who have to shoulder responsibility. The honorable member will cease to have my regard if he acts like that. The manner of providing that increase of revenue is not dealt with in this review. It is incumbent that the greatest economy, consistent with progress and efficiency, shall be practised and that wealth-producing industries shall be stimulated and encouraged in every way possible so as to enable the Commonwealth to bear the heavy burden necessitated by the vast expenditure on the war. </para>

              <para>- I do not accuse the Treasurer of discourtesy, but I point out that the practice of former Treasurers has not been followed in this instance. Hitherto, the Treasurer, before making his financial statement, always handed a copy of it to the Leader of the Opposition. This document has been in my possession for only ten minutes, and I do not propose - indeed, I would not attempt - to offer any detailed criticism of it this evening. There are, however, one or two things which may be referred to. I think the Treasurer will have to abandon the proposed sinking fund of 1 per cent., because the country will not be able to set aside that amount for the extinction of the public debt. I believe the Treasurer will have to come down to \ per cent. It is true that we had a sinking fund of 2&#163; per cent., but there were certain political reasons for that policy which I do not feel called upon to deal with at this stage; but there was a question of war profits and taxation generally. In regard to war profits, we were compelled, out of courtesy to the Prime Minister, to wait until he returned from England, before proceeding with the War-time Profits Bill, which, although introduced, was postponed. The predecessor of the present Treasurer also found it necessary to postpone the measure, and now the present Treasurer is in the same position.&#34; </para>

              <para>- But the Treasurer will see that it is very unlikely that managers or directors of companies will leave anything undone in the way of maintenance and repairs to plant, machinery, or buildings, if by that means they can legitimately use up surplus profits.

              <para>- The Treasurer is certainly very reserved, in regard to this matter. The public know very well that the Liberal party are not in favour of direct taxation. The Australian Labour party introduced the Income Tax Bill, which, of course, provided for direct taxation and, in spite of the opposition of the Treasurer and his colleagues, we collected by that means about &#163;4,000,000. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that the Minister was opposed to it. The people, I say, will remember that the Liberal party are not believers in direct taxation in the way of income tax or land tax, and, that being the case, they must naturally have recourse to indirect taxation, which I think, means the taxation of tea, as one item, and kerosene as another. The Treasurer, of course, is anxious that the electors shall return the Liberal party to power before anything has been said as to the nature of proposed taxation. He tells us it would be unwise to enlighten the electors concerning the means by which it is proposed to raise money to meet the increased expenditure. Why would it be be unwise? It would be unwise because the electors would decline to vote for the right honorable member for Swan and his colleagues. </para>

              <para>- Of course, I can quite understand that anything may be possible for a candidate who, like the Treasurer, can write to practically all the ladies in Western Australia, and conclude his letter with the words, &#34; Your dear old friend, John Forrest.&#34; As I have already said, the Treasurer has not given honorable members a fair opportunity of examining the statement in order that we might criticise it at this stage. I admit freely that we cannot offer much adverse criticism of the large amounts of money that are being spent, because the war is on, and one finds it very difficult to oppose naval and military expenditure. The Defence Department asks for so many millions, and the Navy Office asks for so many more. The duties of the Treasurer of the day are so numerous that it is not in his power to go into the items in detail, but he ought to insist upon the inquiry asked for lately into the naval and military expenditure. We were promised a Committee of Inquiry into the administration of the Defence and Naval Departments. What has become of it? Is it not to be appointed, and are we to wait until the elections take place? I say, as one who has had a little experience, that the defence expenditure is extravagant,  and there is not the supervision that there ought to be over the officers responsible for it. It is very difficult for the Department to obtain officers who have that experience, as accountants, which is necessary, because most of the accountants in Australia are either in the employ of the States or Commonwealth, or in excellent positions in private employment. We cannot get, merely by putting an advertisement in the paper, an accountant qualified to act, for instance, as pay officer in the Defence Department. </para>

          <para class="block">It is time an inquiry was made as to whether the audit of the Government accounts in the Commonwealth is  properly carried out, I saw the other day that a gentleman named Ling had been appointed, and made a <inline font-weight="bold">Major, to</inline> carry out an investigation into the accounts of the Defence Department. My experience of that gentleman was such that he ought really to have been disrated. He ought not to have been intrusted with such an examination. I drew the attention of the Auditor-General to his qualifications, and the Auditor-General, apparently, in spite of that, has recommended him as the officer to make an examination of the accounts of the Defence Department. Will it be believed that this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> H. Ling was the officer recommended by the Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Government in connexion with the sugar agreements? It was his duty to see that the Commonwealth got a fair deal as between the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The Prime Minister asked the AuditorGeneral to send a man qualified to look after those accounts. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went to England, the sugar control was handed over to me. That added to our duties in the Treasury. I was extremely busy, and when the question of the renewal of the agreements between the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Millaquin Sugar Refining Company came forward, I asked the executive officers in charge to draw up the draft of a new agreement to be submitted for my signature. I sent them over to Sydney to interview the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who were complaining about the agreement. They went, and a new draft agreement was submitted to me for signature. I asked  Colonel Oldershaw,  who was in charge, in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling,</inline> if the new draft was  all right. He said, &#34; Yes, it is perfectly all right.&#34; Then, I said, we will go through it. I took the draft, and asked the  Colonel to  read out the original, paragraph by paragraph. When we reached the paragraph in the old agreement providing that a rebate of 10s. in the &#163;1 should be allowed to the Commonwealth on the &#163;1 per ton capital charge allowed to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for managing the business, I found there was no mention of the rebate in the new draft, and asked why this was. Various excuses were made, none of them, to my mind, satisfactory. That 10s. rebate meant anything up to &#163;70,000 or &#163;80,000 to the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> why he had not drawn my attention to the matter, and he had no reasonable excuse to offer. I went to Brisbane on a holiday, so called, and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> being away up the coast, I made an appointment to meet him . at Brisbane, and discuss the new agreement. I asked, also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> should be sent to Brisbane to be present. I discussed the agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling&#39;s</inline> presence. We could not come to terms because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> declined to allow the rebate. I. asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling,</inline> as he informed me that he knew quite well what the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were, and that he had them at his fingers&#39; ends, as he was going down to Sydney on the same boat as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> to point out to that gentleman the profits that the company were making, and inform him that I declined to sign the agreement unless we got the rebate. I also said, &#34; Meet me in Sydney, and in the meantime send me a list of the profits that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been making.&#34; He promised to do that, and to meet me in Sydney. I went up the coast to Rockhampton, returned in about a week&#39;s time, and went to Sydney to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox.</inline> I expected to find awaiting me in Sydney the statement showing the profits of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and to find this Government officer there also; but neither was the list of profits there, nor was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> there. </para>
          <para>A curious incident in the whole of the proceedings was that I got a most familiar wire from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> inviting me to &#34; sit tight,&#34; that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox</inline> was wavering, or something  to that effect, and that &#34;we held the key to the position&#34;; also, &#34; wishing me good luck.&#34; I wired to him at Adelaide in these terms, &#34; You promised to send a list of the profits to me at Sydney; why did you not do so ? You promised to meet me in Sydney; why are you not here?&#34; He replied to the effect that there must be a misunderstanding, and asked whether he would come over to Sydney. Of course, I wired back to him not to come.. </para>
          <para>I drew the attention of the AuditorGeneral to the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling.</inline> The Auditor-General said that he was very much surprised, for his experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> had been highly satisfactory, and he pleaded for him. I replied, &#34; Since you have spoken so highly of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling,</inline> I shall not ask for his dismissal ; but you will please appoint another man to look after the interests of the Government in connexion with this matter.&#34; I believe that another man was appointed at Brisbane - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown,</inline> I think. But after all this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> was appointed to look after the sugar accounts at Adelaide, and this is the gentleman who has been, appointed to carry out an investigation into the defence expenditure. </para>
          <para>In my opinion, there is something wrong with the Audit Department. It may be that the Auditor-General has got past the retiring age. I think that he must be over seventy years of age. I feel, of course, some reluctance in referring to this matter; but one cannot afford to allow personal considerations to intervene when the public interest is at stake. There ought to be an investigation into the naval and military expenditure. I believe there ought to be some investigation as to whether the audit of the Government accounts is being carried out satisfactorily. Certainly my experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ling</inline> would indicate that the audit is carried out in a rather perfunctory manner. </para>

What sort of a Government audit is it that allows the Administrator of the Federal Territory to permit the architect who required the use of a horse, to hire from a groom in the Commonwealth Service a horse at 25s. per week? The horse was hired for something like two years. It contracted some complaint which one of the Government experts diagnosed as glanders. The horse was segregated, all the buildings were disinfected, I believe, and a portion of the animal sent to the Bacteriological Department to be examined to see whether the horse was suffering from glanders. Eventually it was stated by a high expert that the horse was not suffering from that complaint. However, the horse died, and a bill was sent to the Commonwealth. Tne horse, which, as I have said, was owned by a groom in the Commonwealth Service, cost the Commonwealth something over &#163;200. </para>

              <para>- That would be a matter, I think, for the Treasurer to inquire into. The Acting Prime Minister has been about New South Wales making very violent speeches about Federal extravagance in the way of expenditure and the necessity for economy. I invite both the Treasurer and the Acting Prime Minister to inquire how many horses are being hired for the Public Service on the same terms as the horse was hired under the approval of  Colonel Miller. </para>

              <para>- That may be. The item of feed, I suppose, may be put down at &#163;25 per annum. The Commonwealth could have bought and fed a horse for the sum of &#163;75, as against, I think, about &#163;250, that it must have lost about &#163;175 by the transaction. Colonel Miller was responsible, but when he made that mistake what became of the Audit Department? Was there an audit ? Did the AuditorGeneral instruct his officers to investigate the expenditure at Canberra ? And if he did not, why? </para>

            <para>.- I only desire to say a few words more. In the time at our disposal, we will not be able to go into the accounts of the Commonwealth, and I do not propose to say more about them. I wish to refer shortly to the speech of the Prime Minister this afternoon. The Prime Minister obtained leave of the House this afternoon to make a statement. We thought that the Prime Minister would have contented himself with saying what the Government proposed to do; that, having stated that there would be an election, he would briefly give the reasons for the course that he proposed, and tell us the preparations that were necessary to bring us to the country if possible. Instead of doing that, he indulged in a tirade of abuse of this party, intended for the electors. He said not a word about the position of ex-Senator Ready, whose resignation cannot be separated from the charges of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson. Senator Watson</inline> made those charges only after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> had resigned in such a sudden way, and, apparently, after having been, for some days before his resignation, in negotiation with the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister has come here with that statement with a view to creating a panic throughout Australia, with the object of inducing the public to vote for him and his party. He told the House that the statement must not be made public; but, if I am correctly informed, it is very strange that, while he was making it here, it was being set up in type, and that it was afterwards issued in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> this afternoon. If, as the Prime Minister says, ships are not allowed to leave Australia, and all sailings are cancelled, what has become of the British Navy ? This would appear to be another electioneering dodge on the part of the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- Are honorable members running away from it now? The Prime Minister in his statement to this House said, in effect, &#34; The opinion of the public, as announced at the referendum on the 28th October, 1916, will be respected, but, of course, there is no telling what the future may bring forth.&#34; That is what the public have to fear. If they vote for honorable members opposite, they may expect to have compulsory military service introduced in the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I wish to know if this is not part of the political strategy of honorable members opposite. They wish to make out that the demands on the Prime Minister are so great that he has had quite a number of constituencies offered to him. I suppose some constituency will come forward and invite him to contest it. But I venture to say that, after the exposure by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson,</inline> and after the resignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> under such curious circumstances, there will be very few constituencies in the Commonwealth to invite the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- I am merely saying that if it were done, that is my opinion. I cannot bring myself to the attitude of mind of men who would use events of the kind for any political or ulterior purpose. Such events are too big with importance in this country - are too serious altogether - to trifle with in any way; and I regret very much to hear of the suggestion that has been made in this chamber. The simple fact is as stated by the Prime Minister - and he made the statement to-day on his own responsibility; I was totally unaware that he proposed to make it - that we have been warned by the Admiralty at Home that there are to be no more sailings of troop-shins from Australia at present. Honorable members may make what they like of the statement, but to me it is one of the most serious, and indicates the tremendous risks by which we are surrounded, quite justifying the statement of the Prime Minister , this afternoon that the war dangers are coming nearer to Australia. As to the conscription question raised by the honorable member for Capricornia, it is of course well known that he and his friends in the various States are doing their best to make it the issue at the elections so soon to be  upon  us. Indeed, in the State elections of New South &#34;Wales to-day that is being done, so much so that, according to the newspapers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> and his braves are signing a pledge on the subject. I question the necessity or the advisability of doing that, for it only shows the length to which my friends opposite are going. </para>

In other words, this question has been decided by the people for the time being, and there can be no alteration of that decision except by the same people who gave it so recently.

            <para>. - As to what the Minister for the Navy says about a certain cable of which we heard this afternoon, I have only to remark that, if there is a little suspicion cast on its genuineness, there is only one man to blame, and that is the Prime Minister himself. Suspicion is quite justified in view of what happened during the recent conscription campaign, when quite a number of cables were alleged to have been received from General Birdwood, Lieutenant Jacka, and scores of others whom I need not name. But there is this interesting point, that, if this menace is as suggested by the cable, how is it that the proposed delegation to the Imperial Conference had no misgivings about sailing? </para>

              <para>- However, this is all by the way, and I should not have referred to the matter if it had not been mentioned by the Minister for the Navy. I rose to very briefly refer to the statement by the Prime Minister, to which we listened this afternoon. It was the usual sensational speech which the right honorable gentleman delivers here. He asked honorable members on this side what is their policy, and he referred to the now historic Watson charges. The Prime Minister made a. very lengthy statement, and we might have expected that in the course of it he would endeavour to answer those charges from his point of view. So far from doing that, he spent practically the whole of his time in reading the reply made to them in another place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> He accepted all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had said as gospel, and made no attempt to give us his own version of the facts. </para>

              <para>- That is cheap sort of talk. The Prime Minister will not say that. I have no antipathy to the Prime Minister. I do not think that there is any man on this side who has any personal animosity to him. I have not, nor have I any personal animosity to the honorable member for Grey, or any one else. Surely we may indulge in criticism from a political point of view without honorable members regarding what we say as a personal attack. I have never been guilty of making a personal attack upon any one in this chamber, and I have no desire to begin now. I say that the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> are the most serious charges that have ever been levelled against a public man in this country. They cannot be answered in the way suggested by the Prime Minister - by an appeal to the country. What the country demands, and has the right to demand, is thatan independent tribunal shall be appointed to investigate the charges, and that an endeavour should be made to have the verdict of that tribunal before we are called upon to meet the people. If the Government do not adopt this course, they will be actually shirking the question. There is only one honorable way in which these most serious charges can be met. They will not be met by a refutation which is merely that of one man&#39;s word against another, nor can they be met by an appeal to the country. </para>

              <para>- There is a lot of suspicion about them, and the only way in which that suspicion can be removed is to have the matter investigated by an independent tribunal. Let us consider the circumstantial evidence which is apparent to&#39; every one. What are the leading facts in the case? On Saturday, 24th February, the Premier of Tasmania, in response to an urgent cablegram, left that State for Sydney to meet the Prime Minister. On the following Tuesday we read that the Premier of Tasmania was called over by the PrimeMinister to Sydney to discuss matters connected with apples, hops, and wheat, and we know how much wheat is grown in Tasmania. On the Monday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> received a messagefrom the Prime Minister, and from the Premier of Tasmania, telling him to come to Melbourne to have a talk about hops. He arrived by the steamer on the Tuesday, and met the State Premier as appointed, and later in the presence of reporters. The reporters were no doubt called in to make it appear that the meeting was not a secret one, and the talk all the time they were present was about hops and apples. On the Wednesday the State Premier left for Tasmania. On arrival there he said he was surprised to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> had resigned from the State Parliament, and that there was talk about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> resigning from the Senate. What did he do? On the Wednesday he hurriedly called a meeting of the State Executive at the State Government House, and before midnight <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> was toall intents and purposes a member of the Senate. Looking at the facts, must not one think that it was a happy coincidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> before coming from Tasmania to Victoria, should have resigned his seat in the State Parliament ? Connect up his movements with those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> The latter left Melbourne on Monday, arrived in Tasmania on Tuesday, and returned to Melbourne on Wednesday in company with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle.</inline> On Thursday he became sick, and at one minute past 6 o&#39;clock that evening he resigned from the Senate. On Friday morning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> was waiting on the Senate door-mat to take his seat. In the face of information like that, honorable members opposite ask, &#34; What are the charges, and why are you suspicious?&#34; </para>

              <para>- The Minister sits in the chamber at peace with all the world, and the familiar smile with which he meets every question disarms his attackers. This afternoon we heard a statement from the Prime Minister which was supposed to be a fuller version thanthe statement he made on Friday in reference to the Watson charges. On Friday the Prime Minister said, &#34; I did hear rumours of the likely resignation of a senator some weeks ago, and I had an idea as to what State he represented. I made my arrangements accordingly.&#34; What were the arrangements ? </para>

              <para>- If the Government endeavour to blind the public to this incident they will have to raise more dust than I think they are capable of raising. Ex-Senator Ready is to all intents and purposes a poor man so far as his circumstances are known to his friends. If he was genuinely ill he could have obtained leave of absence, as every sick man before him has done. He could have continued a senator until the day of election, and even if his term of office were not renewed he would have drawn &#163;200 &#34;in salary between the present date and the expiration of his term, in June next. But, apparently, with no position awaiting him, he said,&#34;Although I am a poor man, I will resign without consulting my leader; I will forego &#163;200 in salary, and cast myself on the waves of the world.&#34; </para>

              <para>- The PostmasterGeneral does know, but he can do nothing but refer to others who are not at the front as &#34; cold-footers.&#34; However, I do not wish to recall to the honorable gentleman&#39;s mind the historic telegrams he sent during the referendum campaign. Compare these three selected Labour candidates, who have ten sons at the front, with the Postmaster-General or the Minister for Works and Railways, who belong to the Win-the-War party. I say, unhesitatingly, that I would rather stand with Peter Bowling, Arthur Rae, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> on a recruiting platform to-morrow than I would appear there with the honorable member for Balaclava. We all recollect his absence from the recruiting depot some months ago when the honorable member for Batman challenged him to enlist. We know that a few nights after that episode he was asked at a meeting which he was addressing. &#34;What about yourself?&#34;  His  reply was, &#34; I am going to enlist.&#34; The question was then put to him, &#34;When?&#34;  His  reply was, &#34;Later.&#39;.&#39; A few weeks afterwards he said, &#34; Next September I will reach the military age, and then I will shoulder my responsibility to this country.&#34; September came round, but the honorable gentleman never got to the front, except it be the front of the Ministerial bench. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.</inline> He, too, was going to enlist after the conscription campaign. He, also, came to the front - the front Ministerial bench. These are the gentlemen who endeavour to discredit men like Peter Bowling and Arthur Rae. When the whole conspiracy to which I have referred had reached an advanced state of decomposition there was one honorable member on the other side of this chamber, who, to his eternal credit, would not stand up to the unsavoury business. Even that fact did not thwart the three delegates to the Imperial War Conference in their determination to proceed to England with their retinue of ten. But further developments took place, and the little island which has played so prominent a part in this conspiracy was again concerned. In justice to the honorable member for Franklin, it must be said that he adopted the attitude which I have outlined before the publication of the leading article in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> on Saturday last; but that article, I believe, was responsible for the Government being deprived of their majority in another place. </para>

          <para>This curious coincidence apparently struck the Premier as something in the nature of a direction and a leading, and, tired as he was after his journey, he hurriedly called a meeting of the Executive at Government House, and before midnight <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle</inline> was a senator. It was a most happy coincidence that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> before going to Melbourne to talk about hops, should have written to the Governor resigning his seat, unless, indeed, he wrote the letter in Melbourne, and gave it to the Premier to post on the train. Much sympathy may, perhaps, be expressed for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> who quite recently was full of energy, but whose illness was so sudden and severe that he sent his resignation to the  President  of the Senate without telling even the leader of his party anything about it. This sympathy will, perhaps, be modified later on if the ex-senator recovers his health sufficiently to devote his abilities to the administration of an office of profit under the Crown. As 99 people out of 100 are asking if this is part of the bargain, we may as well join in and ask it openly. </para>

We find no fault with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> who, apparently, was offered the reversion of the seat, and, having accepted it, resigned his seat in the State Parliament, in order to render himself eligible for the other.

            <para>.- I desire to say a few words in connexion with the speech delivered this afternoon by the Prime Minister. I was struck by the statement made by the Prime Minister that, in asking for an extension of the life of Parliament, he was acting strictly in accordance with the decision arrived at by the Labour Caucus, when he was leader of the party. That statement was received with acclamation by the Postmaster-General and the honorable member for Barrier, as well as the honorable member for Denison. I want to give an absolute contradiction to the statement made by the Prime Minister the other day, and repeated by him to-day, that the Labour party, in caucus, unanimously instructed him to obtain an extension of the life of Parliament in the manner as described by him. This question of the extension of the life of Parliament was considered by the party in conjunction with the six other questions for the alteration of the Constitution. The Labour Government, then headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> had forced the Referendum Bills through this House, and the Government had incurred an expenditure to the extent of &#163;40,000 in making all the necessarypreparations to submit those questions to the people. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> suddenly convened a meeting of the Labour party and requested members to agree to the withdrawal of those Bills. When this matter was under discussion, the party decided to submit a seventh question, which had to do with the extension of the life of the Senate, so that when the elections for the House of Representatives became due, members of this Chamber and half the members of the Senate could go to the country at the same time. That is the distinction between the deci sion arrived at by the Labour party in caucus and the case as stated by the Prime Minister. While we desired to submit this question dealing with the extension of the life of Parliament in the form of a referendum to the people, the Prime Minister&#39;s statement was to the effect that the party unanimously agreed that he should ask the Imperial Government for this extension. The Postmaster-General has continually been indorsing this expression of opinion by the Prime Minister. The Postmaster-General knows that he himself was responsible for this question being considered in our party. He came back from the last election with a platform, one plank of which related to this proposed extension of the life of Parliament. He advocated it at every meeting, and we desired, as a party, to submit it to the people. If they approved of this course, we were to pass the necessary enabling Bill to give effect to their wishes. To-day the Prime Minister pointed to members of the Labour party on this side, and said that all we desired, and all that we hoped for was the downfall of the Empire and this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns,</inline> the honorable member for Illawarra, rose to a point of order, and took exception to the statement, with the result that the Prime Minister, under pressure, withdrew it, but qualified it by saying, &#34; I will admit that it does not apply to all, but it applies to some.&#34; As the honorable member for Capricornia pointed out, the Prime Minister was not speaking to this House at all, but to the electors of Australia. The Prime Minister is setting out on the coming campaign with the same policy that he set out with in connexion with the referendum. That is a charge of disloyalty against every Labour member and against the tens of thousands of men and women connected with the Labour movement throughout Australia. He launched his policy here to-day, and concluded his speech by saying, &#34; What is this party&#39;s policy ?&#34; I ask, What is the Prime Minister&#39;s policy, and what is the policy of the Government? </para>

              <para>-Win their seats! They are not thinking of their country. The Prime Minister, since he was appointed Leader of our party, has wrecked four Governments, and in each case he hashad no other object in view than to attain his own ambition, and he will continue in that line. What has the Prime Minister done since he came back to this country; what have the present Coalition Government done; and what did the Hughes Government do, when they had the support of the Liberal party, after the split in the Labour party? What new legislation have they initiated that differs in any way from the policy first put forward in this Parliament by the Fisher Government? The Prime Minister left this country a united country with a united people. In the Old World he had honours conferred upon him for what Australia had done in the war. What Australia has done in the war was done under the direction of the Labour Government, with the support of the Labour party. After basking in the sunshine and smiles of the aristocracy of Great Britain, he returned, and from that moment there has been nothing but disunity and discord in the community. When he came back he wrecked his party; he forced his opinions against the majority of his party. He went to the country, and a united people were immediately broken up into disunited factions. He went to them with his referendums, and paralyzed and killed the voluntary enlistment system. He came back from the country a defeated man, and he tells the House to-day that the Labour party was responsible for all that has taken place. The bitterness that has arisen amongst the people is solely due to one man - the Prime Minister. Since his return to Australia he has not passed one piece of legislation, or made one original proposal that differs from the policy of the Labour Government presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher. </para>

At the same time, he gave every credit to the men who followed him on the conscription issue. There are men who followed him in that direction, partly, as I say, because they were hypnotized  or chloroformed, and partly because they thought conscription was going to be their political salvation. The Prime Minister said, to the party, &#34;As a party opposed to conscription, we shall be wiped out of existence. We must save our party; the people of Australia want conscription, and therefore we must go for it, and save the movement. If we do not, the Liberal party will come in on this wave of enthusiasm, and wipe us into political oblivion.&#34; Those, as near as I can remember them, were the Prime Minister&#39;s words.- All the patriotic sentiments that one hears expressed to-day; all this highsounding, patriotic talk, requires a great deal of examination, and will not stand the acid. </para>

              <para>- My statements on the floor of the House, my statements on the public platform, and my votes in the House are all the testimony which I require to refute the inference of the Postmaster-General. The Prime Minister asks what is our policy. Did he tell the country to-day of his policy ? Did he utter one word of policy here? No; but in his usual dramatic way he said, &#34; The Labour party&#39;s policy has only been one policy.&#34; He has heaped abuse upon us since the date on which the referendum was proposed. Why? When the Referendum Bill was going through the House, he turned round and pointed to certain honorable members sitting in the corner, and said, &#34; Within the next few weeks the people of this country will unmask you and know you for the men you are.&#34; From that moment until the date on which the referendum vote was taken the most vile and abusive man who ever went on a public platform holding the responsible position of Prime Minister of Australia was William Morris Hughes. What did he say? He accused the men and women of Australia who would dare to vote against conscription of being murderers. Because by their action they would be murdering the boys in the trenches. He accused every man and woman connected with the Labour movement who were fighting the conscription issue of being disloyal and unpatriotic. He told the members of this House, and the people of this country, that the money which was coming to the anticonscriptionists to be utilized by them in their fight was German gold, that we were disloyal and unpatriotic, that we were murderers. He heaped upon us every vile name which his marvellous tongue could employ. When the fight- was over a (meeting of our party took place, and this gentleman walked into the room where were assembled the representatives of a movement against whom he had made all these infamous charges and took the chair. This man - a man who is only animated by the highest possible patriotic motives - was still prepared to walk into our room, preside as leader of the party and leader in this honorable House if we chose to allow him to remain as our leader and our Prime Minister. My conduct was perfectly consistent again, because from the moment that the right honorable member went into the chair I took exception to his action. I said that he had no right to be in the chair until he had explained his conduct to the representatives of the movement in the room. I submitted that any man who held the opinions of the Labour movement, and of the men and women connected with the movement and its representatives in this House, which he had expressed, should not for one moment have consented or desired to associate with them again. But the Prime Minister was quite prepared to associate with us, provided, of course, that we would keep him in power. When the Labour party was no longer behind him what did he do? He sought the support of the Liberal party of Australia - the Conservatives, the wreckage of all parties as he had described them, the flotsam and jetsam of the black labour movement, the sweaters of the Employers&#39; Federation, the men for whom he could never find words strong enough to express his contempt collectively and individually. When he came back from the conscription fight and had no longer the support of Labour members he was quite prepared to accept the support of his lifelong political enemies, provided that they would retain him in office, because, according to his statements, upon his retention of office depended the issue of the great war raging in Europe. From A to Z examine his speeches and the message which went out to Australia and its people was this: &#34; Without me, Australia and the Empire must fall.&#34; Therefore it was essential, come what might, that William Morris Hughes, the ex-Labour leader, and now the recognised Labour traitor, should be Prime Minister of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The party believed that in doing that it was only fulfilling what the people of Australia expected it to do. I ask the honorable member for Henty: &#34;What has any one member of his party or of the Hughes party done outside of what was initiated by the Fisher Government in 1914, and what do they intend to do in the future &#34; ? Because there is only one distinction between the policies of the two parties. The Labour party and Government stood out for all that Australia could do under the voluntary system, and that is our policy to-day. There was only one form of action which cur opponents could take, and that was to introduce compulsory military service. What is their attitude to-night? It is that, even though the safety of the Empire depended upon compulsory military service, rather than advocate that policy and bring about their political death, they are prepared to sink it and save their political skins. </para>

              <para>- Didthey? The honorable member for Fawkner says that the Labour party, of which he is a member, is in favour of prosecuting the war. Has he read this evening&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and the business to be put before the Melbourne Conference? A number of societies have declared emphatically that they intend to vote for the repeal of a portion of the Defence Act, of which the original Labour party were proud, and for which they took the credit of having put it on the statute-book. They wish to have repealed that portion of the Defence Act which provides for compulsoryservice for home defence. </para>

              <para>- The other night a number of honorable members on the opposite side rose in their places, and denied <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> certain statements made by the Prime Minister, although twentyfive of us who were members of the same party are ready to state on oath that the statements were correct. There is nothing in the policy of honorable members opposite but scurrilous abuse of the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member admits it. There has been nothing but scurrilous attacks on this man since he returned from England to Australia. All he asked us to do was what we thought agreeable to our own consciences; and when we do so we are called &#34; traitors &#34; and &#34; rats.&#34; I am glad there is going to be an election, because I believe it will afford some possibility of clearing the atmosphere. It has been perfect hell in this House and Parliament for some time past. Honorable gentlemen opposite will now have an opportunity to justify their attitude in regard to the war. At this stage of the war and of our history there ought not to be two opinions in this House. Honorable members opposite would to-day support the Liberals if the present Prime Minister was not at the head of the Government. Does that not prove that the whole of their policy is animosity to the Prime Minister ? Do not the admissions conveyed in the interjections we hear prove the fact ? Ever since the Prime Minister came home to Australia efforts have been made to ruin his character, and the remarkable statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> is only in keeping with the tyranny that has been practised. I said to-night that there were some honorable members who would cut the Prime Minister&#39;s throat if they found him in a dark place. I remember that on one occasion a man who was sent to the Industrial Workers ofthe World was shot; and that vindictive spirit from outside goes back to the speech which the Prime Minister made before he went to England, and in which he referred to the alien element which had got into the Labour movement. Honorable members know well the truth of what I am saying, and anything and everything that could be done has been done to ruin the Prime Minister&#39;s character. Yet these men talk about fighting fairly and of their belief in an honorable fight! One man, the honorable member for Brisbane, has had a lot to say about the Prime Minister, but the first Labour vote that that man ever gave in his life was a vote for himself; and such are the men who hold up the Prime Minister as a renegade to the Labour movement. What greater proof could we have that he has been true to his principles? The honorable member for Fawkner and the honorable member for Indi have said that the only legislation introduced by the present combination is part of the Labour policy. </para>

They will be given an opportunity to produce their evidence. They make their attacks here where they can make them under privilege, but if they have any courage, let them take it in both hands and go outside, and say that&#39; the Prime Minister offered to pay <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> to come over to his side. They are not game to do that. They hurl their insinuations and dirty statements at the Prime Minister from their privileged benches. Let them go outside and make those statements.
