            <para>- A deputation representing the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Manly waited upon me yesterday and urged the removal of the Quarantine Station to some other area. I informed the deputation, which mentioned one or two sites which it was thought might suit the purpose, that this matter had been under the consideration of the Department for some time, and that the late Director of Quarantine had reported that the various sites suggested were unsuitable for thepurpose. In passing, I may mention that the removal of the Quarantine Station would in itself involve a very heavy expenditure. I informed the deputation&#39;, however, that if there could be suggested a site that would fulfil the necessary conditions, it would certainly be considered by the Department. Sydney is a very important commercial and shipping centre, a fact that cannot be overlooked in determining the location of a Quarantine Station, and I mentioned that, in considering the suitableness of any site, regard would have to be paid to the importance of the shipping interests to be served. I reminded my interviewers that a matter that had given rise to great anxiety on the part of citizens of Sydney was that vessels had come right down from the north into the port of Sydney with quarantinable diseases on board, but that the cause for this anxiety was now being, removed, since three Quarantine Stations were being provided north of Sydney. One of these is being placed at Thursday Island, another at Townsville, and the third at Brisbane. </para>

              <para>- Not the liberty of the press to run our Departments. The reporter of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> said that it was very unfair - that I was muzzling a great Department which I knew had an answer. I replied that I was not muzzling the Department, but wished to give the fullest information, and was ready to give it to any honorable member who asked a question in the proper place, namely, Parliament. The reporter of the newspaper then said - and this is what I wish honorable members to bear in mind - &#34; That is no good to me; I want copy.&#34; It is because that gentleman desires exclusive copy at the expense of the Departments that he is adopting this particular method. This morning the Chief Electoral Officer informed me that, so far as he was personally concerned, he did not wish to see the reporter of this newspaper, and that he had in no way been suppressed or gagged by the present Administration. If the Leader of the Opposition or the honorable member for Yarra has any doubt, I shall be only too happy for them to see the Chief Electoral Officer. I may say that one reason why I felt it particularly necessary to be careful of this press reporter is that, some time ago, when a controversy was going on in another place, he wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> as follows </para>

            <para>The figures prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> were submitted in response to an inquiry by a member of the Senate, and merely gave a rough approximation of the number of persons in Australia qualified for enrolment on or about the date of the issue of the writs for the recent elections. </para>
            <para>It is admittedly a very difficult matter to even approximately estimate the number of persons qualified for enrolment actually in Australia or in each State at any given time, or the number of persons enrolled but temporarily absent, or the number of persons not enrolled. The main point raised has been that the total enrolment for the purposes of the elections exceeded the total number of persons qualified for enrolment. The Chief Electoral Officer reported that, altogether apart from any question of irregularity, there must always be an excess of names on the electoral rolls at any given date for reasons which arise under the law, and the Minister referred to the matter in his second-reading speech on the Electoral Bill. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs a question arising out of an answer given by the Attorney-General relating to objections lodged to the names of electors being placed upon the rolls. From his statement I gathered that before objections could be filed, full inquiry would be made, either by a police officer or other official. I understood that that procedure was to be followed. But I have received several letters from residents in the Creswick district, which show that it is not being followed. Objections are being lodged to the names of people who have resided in that district for thirty or forty years, without any preliminary inquiry whatever. Will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs take action in regard to these objections, otherwise many of these persons may not take notice of them, and their names may thus be struck off the rolls? </para>

The intimation to which I refer has evidently been received by the Liberal party before any other party knew anything about it. It is to the effect that if objections are lodged against names on the electoral roll, the immediate effect will be .that those names will not be placed on any roll. I know that the Liberal party in Ballarat have lodged information against hundreds of names - or, at any rate, scores of names. I want to ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether he will see that every  Deputy  Registrar - I do not think that the Registrars would do anything dishonorable </para>

It is quite the practice - as I am sure honorable members will realize if they read the business-paper for the last few days - to put upon it contingent notices of motion of that kind. Only the other day the Treasurer gave notice that, contingent on a certain Bill going into Committee, he would move in a certain direction. If there is to be any change in that procedure I would be glad to know it, so that I may adopt another method of bringing my views before the House and the country. </para>

After having seen the notice referred to, it seemed to me that the honorable member did not seriously propose it. And, in any case, it was one which no  Speaker  could, with propriety, accept seriously. I, therefore, directed that it should not be printed. It was couched in ironical terms.

            <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question arising out of reports which have appeared in the daily press. Certain newspapers credit him with having stated that for three months the business of Parliament has been hung up by the obstructive tactics of the Opposition, and that Opposition members are persistently obstructing the transaction of business. I desire to ask him if it is not a fact that out of that three months the sittings of Parliament were suspended for five weeks to suit the convenience of the Government, and why he has not adopted morning and night sittings in order to put through the business which, he says, is being delayed ? </para>

But since notice has been taken of the honorable member&#39;s statement, I remind him that such a course of conduct is really a breach of the privileges of Parliament. The honorable member has no right deliberately to do something which he knows to be disorderly. I hope that he will not offend in that way any more; otherwise, serious notice will have to be taken of his conduct. </para>

Honorable members on the other side, particularly the Prime Minister, are, at public meetings in the country, dealing with things political, and making incorrect statements. When the matter is referred to here, invariably he refuses to give a reply, or characterizes the question .as offensive or insulting. As these incorrect statements reflect very seriously upon honorable members on this side, what do you, sir, suggest we should do to protect ourselves from a continuance of this treatment? </para>

              <para>- It is highly disorderly for an honorable member to interject when the  Speaker  is on his feet. I have been asked, a question, and am giving information&#39; to the House. In the House of Commons, questions without notice are rarely asked, and invariably, when asked, they have to deal with matters of urgent public importance, and a private intimation of the intention of. a member to ask the question is conveyed to the Minister. With regard to the nature of questions which may be asked, the practice is laid down by a number of authorities. I have had extracts taken from these authorities for ready reference by myself, and it may, perhaps, be as well for me to read some of the quotations for the information of honorable members. On page 255 of <inline font-style="italic">Brand&#39;s Decisions</inline> the rule is laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> as follows - </para>

          <para>- If the honorable member desires to raise a question of privilege, the proper course for him to pursue is to produce a copy of the paper containing the matter complained of, give the name of the printer or publisher, and conclude with a motion declaring the matter of which he complains to be a breach of privilege, and tlie person complained of to be guilty of contempt, as provided in standing order No. 285. It will then be for the House to take such further action as may be considered necessary. That is the only way in which a question of privilege can be effectively raised. </para>

          <para>.- Just before the House rose on Friday last, I submitted several amendments which I had prepared to the consideration of Ministers and of the Ministerial party  in  general. I mentioned at the time that I looked upon them as a very fair compromise, and expressed the hope that honorable members on the other side of the House would deign to consider them fully. I also trust that they will be able to accept them, aud thereby make it possible for the Bill to pass, not only this House, but also another place. I believe that if they were accepted by the Ministerial party and by the Government, the measure would have a very fair chance of being passed by the Senate. I intimated on Friday last that I was in favour of giving the postal vote under certain conditions, to any elector who, on polling day, during the hours of polling, would not, be within 10 miles of any polling place, or happened to be quarantined in the Commonwealth. Women in a certain condition cannot, of course, attend a polling-booth, and, as we have often been told by our friends on the other side, we should not withhold the franchise from the mothers of the nation.. In order to meet. the. Government and the Ministerial party in that respect, my third proposition is that any female elector who will not, ou polling day, during the hours of voting, on account of ill-health or infirmity, be able to attend at any polling place, may, after the issue of the writ, upon making a declaration in the prescribed form before a postmaster, vote as an absent voter. Of course, there would haveto be a schedule in connexion with this amendment, to provide that the declaration shall be made, and the vote recorded only at the post-office of which such postmaster is in charge : and, secondly, that the declaration shall not be valid unless the postmaster stamps it with the postoffice letter stamp of the date on which the declaration is made. This proposal would safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, and at the same time meet the case of the female electors. It would enable those living over a certain number of miles from any polling-booth to record their votes, and also meet the case of people who happened to be in quarantine on the day of election. I understand that the honorable member for Bourke- has expressed himself as willing to vote with the Government for restoring the postal vote as it has operated in previous Commonwealth elections. If so, that honorable member cannot have had any practical experience. </para>

            <para>- If he does mean that, I do not think that he could have had any practical experience of the postal voting system. I do not blame honor-, able members on either side of the House who have not had any practical experience. The Attorney-General, for instance, I look upon as an honorable gentleman in every sense of the word from both a political and private point of view ; but, as he has evidently had no experience in this matter, he thinks that everybody else must be of necessity honest and above board. All my experience, however, absolutely prevents me from voting for the restoration of the postal vote as we have had it in Commonwealth elections. I can assure honorable members that it is quite possible to get hundreds of votes under that system , not illegally, but within the letter of the law, and without taking the slightest shadow of risk. If one were unscrupulous enough to do so, he could do the business- himself without inducing, other electors to do so. If I were given a few weeks, I could get at least 400- postal votes under the old system if I wanted to, but, of course, I would not do so. I shall oppose the Government proposition in that respect bitterly, and I sincerely hope that if it is passed in this House, it will be rejected in another place. However, I submit my amendments as a fair compromise to the consideration of honorable members on the other side. I have a very shrewd suspicion of what takes place when membersmeet together, and honorable membersopposite may have been told by the Government, to stick to the Bill, and nothing but the Bill. No doubt some honorable members in particular have been advised to. that effect by Ministers, when perhaps prompted by their consciences to- object&#39; to some of the provisions of this Bill, but I should like to . advise them not to stick to. the Bill - in its entirety. Surely, we can reason together, and&#39;  arrange  a- compromise-. If it is really the. desire of honorable members opposite to pass a Bill which will meet the just demands of those who, at election time, are laid aside by sickness, or are beyond a certain number of miles from a polling booth, they can do so by accepting amendments which will enable the measure to pass through this Blouse, and, I think, through the other Chamber also. As to the number of miles that a voter must be distant from a polling booti) on the day of the elections to be qualified to vote by post, I arn willing, if the Government cannot accept 10, to agree to 5, because I wish to meet Ministers in every way; but I warn the House against restoring the postal voting system in its original form, because it opens the door to any amount of swindling and underhand work. There have been hundreds of cases in which the names of candidates have been written down by the canvassers. </para>

            <para>- Not by any means; I would not stoop to such a thing. But I am certain that it has been done. A postal voter had- to sign his name, and the signature was witnessed by a justice of the peace. Tt was immaterial to the Returning Officer, when the ballot-paper was being counted, who had written in the name of the candidate. If Ministers accept the amendments which I have foreshadowed, I shall support the second reading, and I hope that in Committee we shall be able to effect some alterations. </para>

          <para>.- It is not my intention to support the second reading of the Bill. I have had twenty years&#39; experience of electoral legislation, and I have no hesitation in saying that this is the most drastic, and one of the worst Bills that I have ever seen put before Parliament. Personally , I think that there should be some pause after the heat of an election before the introduction of an amending electoral measure. All the spleen, bitterness, and animus provoked by the elections are to be seen in this Bill, which has been conceived in hatred, quickened in malice, and has had its birth - I refer to the speech of the Honorary Minister - in vile vituperation. Why did the honorable gentleman refer to the 143,000 persons who have been convicted of minor offences? What had their conviction to do with the Bill ?  His  object was to vilify honorable members on this side. He says that he did not associate us directly with them, but he stated indirectly that if our seats were in clanger, they would come to our rescue. Let me tell him that he has afforded additional evidence of the fact that education alone does not make a gentleman. A residue of the 143,000 persons to whom he referred may permit themselves to be used in connexion with elections, but they do not give their services for love. It is not long since, in this State, in the <inline font-style="italic">Ronald</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Harper</inline> case, on the evidence of certain witnesses a verdict was obtained ; but within a few months nine of these witnesses were serving sentences for perjury. Their evidence had not been procured by any member of the Labour party. If the services of such men are used in connexion with elections, the Honorary Minister knows who are best able to use them. The measure should be entitled, &#34;A Bill for an Act <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> to limit the facilities for electors getting their names on the electoral roll; (?&#39;) to provide facilities for the wholesale removal of the names of <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> electors from the roll, and (c) to enable inquisitorial and vindictive persons to ascertain how other electors record their votes. The Bill provides, first, for limiting the period during which names can be placed on the roll. Undoubtedly the object is to prevent thousands of persons from being enrolled. </para>

            <para>- There is a date fixed now. Probably more names are now enrolled during the month preceding an election than in the whole three years of the life of a Parliament; but honorable members opposite wish to prevent persons from being enrolled in that month. The Bill will deprive thousands of young men and young women coming of age just before an election of the opportunity to vote. Honorable members opposite have not the courage to say that they do not believe in adult franchise; but there are ways of destroying it, and they have adopted one of them, namely, the placing of all possible difficulties in the way of enrolment. The Bill provides, also, for the restoration of the postal vote, honorable members opposite displaying their  chivalry  by expressing great anxiety for giving the ladies the vote. But let me read what they say to the women of the country. The party with which they are associated has described our wives, our mothers, and our daughters as breeding cows. That statement is taken from a document issued by the Liberal Union. If it could be proved that that is not so, I would resign my position. </para>

            <para>- It was made in an official publication containing the names of the Liberal candidates and their photographs, and setting out the ticket of the party. The issue was published in March last. In it is a quotation taken from a book called <inline font-style="italic">A Year and a Bay.</inline> The quotation is printed under the heading of &#34;Atheist Socialism,&#34; but the writer referred to a Socialistic club. The word &#34; Socialism &#34; was substituted for the words &#34; Atheist Socialistic Club,&#34; to give the passage an application to the Socialists of Australia, because, as applying to an atheistical Socialistic club, they had no relevance. The intention was to deliberately blacken our characters, and the characters of our wives, mothers, and daughters. They said that we had no further use for the women of this country than to make them breeding cows, and wished to father their children on the State, instead of on the animals who bred them. That is the statement of gentlemen who now parade on the housetops their chivalry to women, and  who  say they want to give the women a vote. </para>

            <para>- Why were they published in the document from which I am quoting ? They were published to alienate the sympathy and support of the electors from what is known as the Socialist party. Those responsible for the publication went further, and told the electors that if they met Socialists and listened to their talk, they would be amazed at the low value they placed upon women. I ask honorable members opposite if that is true ? There is no answer. Again, they said that they did not know any persons who dishonoured women more. Is that a true statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> ? You have been associated with the members of this House for many years, and I venture to say that you would not willingly and knowingly be party to a statement branding those with whom I am associated as dishonourers of women. If this is to be a fight with the gloves off, honorable members will get what they wish for. We know where the women are dishonoured ; and if they want to know they will have it. They go on to say that there are none who dishonour their mothers more. Could there be a worse indictment against a political party than that? </para>

In fact, in this very document there is a reference to free love and the Labour party. </para>

            <para>- Probably, and I think they did; but that is not my business, and I take no exception to it. As a matter of fact, the Socialists of Australia opposed such views at the last election, as they have done on previous occasions; and yet, because, like some honorable members opposite, we are more or less Socialistic, this document is issued with the sole purpose, of damaging us in the eyes of the electors. As to the postal vote, whether the radius be 5 miles or 20 miles makes no difference; and if this method be restored I can see very great danger of a large  number  of votes being manipulated. At one time in our political history lords and squires and their ladies used  to  drive the electors to the poll, and stand by while they recorded their votes openly; andwith postal voting, clear of the supervision of the proper officials, there is a possibility of the introduction of all the bad, old elements of a by-gone day. As to newspapers, I have yet to learn where  an  honest publication has been placed  at  any disadvantage because of the provision that the names of the writers shall be attached to the political articles for a certain period during election time. I should not be afraid to attach my name to any writing in which I attacked another person; and I do  not  see why the press should be allowed, not liberty, but the licence which they frequently exercise, and sometimes from personal spleen, to ruin a man&#39;s politicalchances. I have heard some very prominent pressmen say that the signing of the articles has a very marked effect in improving the tone of electoral discussions; and I shall certainly vote against the proposed amendment of the Act in this connexion. But the most serious proposal of the Government is that in connexion with the signing of the butts of the ballot-paper. If, as I have said, this Bill is one to enable inquisitorial and vindictive electors to ascertain how other electors record their votes, a better way could not be provided. A scrutineer has only to make a note alongside a number, and if he be also engaged at the counting of the votes, he can easily ascertain how a particular man has voted; indeed, scrutineers might just as well be handed the ballot-papers with the names attached. An honorable member opposite has said that any invasion of the secrecy of the ballot would cause a veritable hell upon earth, and the proposal of the Government would certainly enable a vindictive person to trace votes, thus giving rise to intimidation and recrimination. At outside stations an overseer sometimes votes for a Labour candidate, and it would be a bad job for him if his vote could be traced. </para>

            <para>- That is so to a limited extent, but absent voting provides facilities that otherwise could not be provided. In any case, it is only in one locality where it could be ascertained how a man has exercised an absent vote. At the last election I, as an elector for Grey, voted as an absentee in Adelaide, but my vote was forwarded to Grey under cover, and, in any case, no name was attached. It is truly marvellous to have such a proposal laid before us in this, the twentieth, century. Many years ago the Attorney-General showed the bent of his mind in matters electoral. It is not the first time in Victoria that thousands of voters have been disfranchised, and the honorable gentleman would seem to show that his anger has not been appeased, but has been carried into the Bill before us. I regret that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs is not present in the chamber during the discussion, but it is the usual courtesy shown by him. When I asked the honorable gentleman a question the other day he told me an untruth. </para>

            <para>- Well, I shall say that the honorable gentleman&#39;s answer was incorrect. I asked him whether cer- , tain instructions had gone out in connexion with the removal of names from the roll, and he said they had not; but, immediately afterwards, the AttorneyGeneral, in reply to a second question, admitted that an invitation had been given, not, perhaps, to certain political bodies, but generally-  </para>

            <para>- Yes, to suggest names that ought to be removed from the roll. To-day we have been informed of an official document in which such instructions were sent out. It is true that the officials of the Department are to make the usual inquiries before people are struck off, but what is the effect of such instructions at the present time ? I  am told that in a part of Colac, with a little over 1,000 names on the roll, some 203 have already been struck off. Under the law as it stands, a fee of 5s. has to be paid before an objection can be lodged; and here I wish to say that the Honorary Minister very nicely &#34; sidetracked &#34; us the other day when he referred to section 69 of the Act, and said  that what is being done now has been done all along. That statement, I say, is not correct. Section 69 provides that it is the duty of the Returning Officer or the Registrar to lodge or make an objection in writing, setting forth the grounds of the objection in respect of any name which he has reason to believe ought not to remain on the roll. That is an instruction to an official, but the Government have gone further, and, as the honorable member for Corio says, have issued an invitation to all and sundry, but particularly to the Liberal unions, to lodge objections. My first information as to this was obtained from st speech of the Attorney-General at a gathering of the Women&#39;s National League at Ballarat, when he invited the members of that body to assist the Government in &#34; purifying the rolls.&#34; It will be remembered that in the statement of the Government policy which accompanied the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, we were told that the purification of the rolls was being proceeded with, and every endeavour being made to insure their accuracy. From this it will be gathered that what is being done was then contemplated. The Honorary Minister today absolutely evaded the question that lie was asked. He may think it very well to slate an unfortunate pressman who is not present, or, in any case, cannot reply on the floor of the House. The honorable gentleman said that he referred to this matter in his speech on the second reading of the Bill. It is alleged that there are over 170,000 more names on the roll than there are adults qualified to vote. When the Prime Minister and his colleagues are speaking at tea parties and other social gatherings, they invariably quote the Statistician&#39;s figures, and assert that at&#34; the last general election there were on the rolls the names of 175,000 persons in excess of the adult population of Australia. They mention this as if it were a fact. </para>

            <para>- That charge is incorrect. A great many apparent duplications can be accounted for by the process followed in transferring the name of an elector from one roll to another. A name cannot be removed from a roll, in the case of a person who has shifted from one electorate to another, until it has been added to the roll for the electorate to which he has removed. When that addition has been made, notice is sent to the Returning Officer for the electorate from which the elector has removed, and the name is thereupon struck off the roll for that division. This takes some time, so that on any given day of the year there is apparently a large duplication of names, but a duplication that cannot be avoided. </para>

            <para>- No. After the last general election, it was claimed by the Liberal party that thousands of persons had voted, although they had no right to vote. It was said that even the dead had voted. A remarkable feature of these charges is that they are made only in respect of electorates which returned members of the Labour party. The AttorneyGeneral obtained from the Chief Electoral Officer a memorandum regarding this question of duplicate voting, and that report bears out my contention. Members of the Ministry have denied making these charges, bub I have before me a statement made by an honorable senator, who is a member of the present Government, to the following effect: - </para>

        <para class="block">I complain of the failure &#39;of the Government to obtain a report from the Chief Electoral Officer when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> made his unsolicited statement as to the apparent disparity between the number pf names on the rolls and the census returns. The Honorary Minister&#39; attempted to reply to a statement by a newspaper reporter who had the audacity to say something in regard to these figures. Of course, it was very naughty of the newspaper man to do anything of the kind. When he was told that he was not to have the desired information, he ought not to have said another word about the Department. I venture to say that the statement made by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to-day is not an answer to the charge made by the newspaper report in question, neither is it an answer to a statement made in this House. What we ought to have from the Chief Electoral Officer is a report showing what proportion of the alleged excess of 175,000 names ought not to be on the rolls. I venture to say that such a report would be very different from the statement made by the Minister. The honorable gentleman says that this question was answered by him when introducing the Bill. On that occasion he referred to the  alleged excess of 175,000, and went on to say that the Chief Electoral Officer reported on the matter as follows: - </para>

        <para>That is not the point we are discussing. We want to know from the Chief Electoral Officer to what extent it would be possible to avoid this alleged duplication. No Electoral Act could be so framed, as to render it possible to have no duplications on the rolls on any particular day. </para>
        <para class="block">The last general election took place on the 31st May, and since two months elapsed between the issue of instructions to transfer a name from one set of rolls to another, and the finalizing of the matter, I take it that on that date there would be a greater apparent duplication, owing to the rush to be enrolled, than on any day during the preceding three years. It must not be forgotten that rolls are not printed every month, and that consequently thousands of names on the ordinary printed rolls do not appear on the certified rolls in the Electoral Office. When an objection is lodged,&#39; inquiry has to be made, and if the objection holds good, the name in question is ruled off the Electoral Officer&#39;s certified copy. The ordinary rolls in use outside do not show that alteration. In this case a clean roll was taken by the Government Statistician, and it showed that there were 2,760,216 names enrolled. That roll, however, made no allowance for transfers in process of being carried out. It therefore covered, I am confident, many thousands of names which were being transferred from one roll to another. As against this number on the rolls, the Government Statistician quoted a total of 2,585,000, on the basis of the census returns. I have worked out the figures, and they show that in the case of South Australia there were on the rolls, apparently, 7,026 in excess of the number that ought to have been enrolled. A great many of these names were in course of transfer. </para>

            <para>- I&#39; do not think that that officer will affirm that my statement is incorrect. If he does, he will exhibit a want of knowledge of the actual working of the Electoral Department, for the simple reason that the clean rolls vary from day to day. The only place in  which clean rolls can be obtained is the Chief Electoral Office. Honorable members themselves do not know the names which appear upon those rolls until almost the day of election. The reason is that transfers are continually coming in, and new names are constantly being inserted. On the other hand, the census returns are based upon the number of persons resident in particular localities at a particular time. It is impossible to apply the same rule to ascertain the number of persons who should be on our electoral rolls. I have very little more to add. I think it would be wise to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, and consequently I give notice that, contingent upon its passing the second-reading stage, I will move - </para>

        <para class="block">Before adopting such drastic proposals as are embodied in this Bill, we ought to have a thorough inquiry upon the lines I have indicated. So far, not one scintilla of evidence has been forthcoming to justify the sweeping alterations proposed. Why should we change our whole electoral system merely for party purposes? Rightly or wrongly, honorable members opposite feel that the existing law is more favorable to the Labour party than it is to them. Of course, the more adults there are who exercise the franchise the stronger the Labourpartywillundoubtedly become. On the other hand,, the party opposite will be benefited by any process which will prevent adults from getting their names placed upon the rolls. Surely it is the duty of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to give us some evidence of illegal practices in connexion with the recent general elections ! I regret to observe that it is proposed to hold the general elections on some day other than Saturday. We all know that Saturday afternoon is a half -holiday, practically throughout the whole of the States. Upon what day can greater facilities be afforded  to the people to exercise the franchise ? Of course, if we do not wish them to vote, we shall hold the elections on some other day of the week. In South Australia, elections have been held on Saturday for about fifteen years, and no complaint has been made Surely it is idle to urge that, by holding elections on Saturday, the counting of the votes has to be suspended over Sunday. Can any election be held in the Commonwealth the result of which has not to stand over for a few days ? The only reason assigned for holding elections on any day other than Saturday is that the ballot-boxes might be burnt on the Sunday. </para>

            <para>- We all know very well that if this Bill be passed the Government will do away with Saturday elections. In South Australia the holding of elections on a Saturday, instead of on a Wednesday, resulted in an increased vote of 20 per cent. How can men possibly leave their work to exercise the franchise on any day other than Saturday? I recollect the occasion of a by-election in South Australia on which the business people induced the Factory Act authorities to waive the Saturday half-holiday. This was done within two days of the polling, and the result was that thousands of votes less were recorded than were recorded at the ordinary Saturday election. In my opinion, Saturday affords greater facilities to the working classes to exercise the franchise than are enjoyed by them upon any other day. Of course, the residents of Toorak who have their motor-cars can vote on any day. But there are some persons who have conscientious convictions, and who do not like to ride in motor-cars when they are not going to vote for the candidate in whose interest they are being run. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members upon this side of the House have been charged with having entered into a conspiracy of silence. Amongst those who have been most vehement in expressing that view was the honorable member for Boothby,  i  He accused us of not being permitted to speak on this Bill. He declared that we had to sit quietly behind the Government and accept it without a word of criticism or comment. As  a  member of the party supporting the Government, I wish to assure him that there has been no such limitation placed upon us in regard to the expression of our views on this measure. We are perfectly free to discuss it as we think proper. I, for one, would not permit myself to be used by any Government or any party in the way that has been suggested. I am absolutely at liberty to criticise this Bill as I think proper. Generally speaking, it has my support, but there are certain features of it which do not entirely meet with my approval, and upon which I shall have something to say in Committee. There are other features in connexion with electoral matters and the amendment of our electoral law which should have received consideration at the hands of the Government, but which have not. The professed object of all parties in this House is to secure the enactment of an electoral law as nearly as possible perfect, to provide for a proper system of registration of- the electors, to devise the best means of enabling them to record their votes, and to insure the secrecy of the ballot. If that be our real desire, why not approach this Bill  in the spirit in which it should be approached? Under the existing system of party government, it seems to me that, because the Ministry introduce a measure, the Opposition feel bound to condemn it. If we are going to approach the consideration of an Electoral Bill, which goes to the very foundation of good government, in that spirit, then we can scarcely expect any satisfactory results. Because the Government have introduced a measure that is not exactly in accordance with the views of honorable members opposite, it seems to me that the latter have set themselves out to criticise it to an extent which involves considerable delay in the transaction of the business of the country. </para>

            <para>- Fortunately, I come to this House fresh, hoping to assist in the conduct of the business of the country in a business-like way. I must admit that I am disappointed that, so far, very little progress has been made. Very little progress seems likely to be made if measures are to be discussed in the carping spirit which has been exhibited on this occasion. If we wish to secure the best electoral system, why nob consider this Bill calmly and dispassionately? Why not get into Committee and consider what is desirable in the interests of a good electoral system ? I am pleased to say that, notwithstanding all the criticism which has been levelled at this measure, we already appear to have converts to it amongst honorable members upon the opposite side of the House. A number of them now admit that the postal vote should be restored- </para>

            <para>- -Honorable members, in doing so, try to cover up their tracks by saying, &#34; We. will limit the postal vote to a certain class of persons ; we are desirous of restoring it, but we want a perfect system.&#34; Let us then get into Committee, and evolve a perfect system. Then, no doubt, all parties will be satisfied, and the postal vote will be restored. Amongst the extraordinary proposals that have been put forward by the Opposition iti connexion with this measure is one by the ex-Minister of Home Affairs, that we should abolish rolls altogether. But in the course of some conversational discussion across the chamber, which, I admit, was quite out of order, I drove the ex-Minister into a corner, whereupon he left the subject and entered upon a discussion of compulsory voting. He found that his position was utterly untenable. So it is with regard to a large number of similar suggestions made in criticism of this Bill. It is generally admitted that our electoral system should be improved, although the honorable member for West Sydney claimed that the present -system is a* nearly perfect as possible. The Bill may be considered under different heads. One of the earliest provisions made in it is in connexion with the divisions of electorates. A new departure has been made by the Government in the method of fixing the boundaries of electorates. Any scheme for this purpose has to be submitted to a Judge of the High Court,, or. of the Supreme Court of a State, who, having dealt with the matter, will report to Parliament, which may accept his report or reject it. Then it will be open for the Judge to make a second or final division, which will become law. Whilst, on the whole, I think it desirable that the matter of adjusting the boundaries of electorates should be dealt with by a Judge, as proposed, I should like to see an amendment made by which we should obtain the benefit of the knowledge and practical experience of officers like the Surveyor-General and the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not bind myself to submit an amendment providing that those officers should sit with the Judge, but I think that their expert knowledge would be of considerable value to him. A provision might be inserted, however, by which the Judge, as a person absolutely independent, should have the ultimate decision. </para>

            <para>- It does not provide for a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or a Judge of the High Court of the Commonwealth, to act. Under the present arrangement, the  chairman  is the Surveyor-General, if obtainable; and the provision which operates if he is nob available is extremely loose, inasmuch as it provides that an officer of his Department, or some person having like qualifications, shall take his place. I consider that that is most unsatisfactory, and is a point which requires amendment. I suggest that the Judge should have some assistance, instead of acting solely as proposed . </para>

            <para>- Yes. I am dealing with the provision of this Bill affecting the division of a State into electorates. That affects the question of representation. I should like to see provision made in this Bill for giving effect to section 7 of the Constitution Act, the framers of which clearly had in mind that the time would arrive when the States should no longer return senators by voting as one electorate, but should be divided up in order to insure the election, of senators on a basis that might be desirable, in view of altered conditions. </para>

            <para>- Although I am a new member of rhis House, I must say that remarks of that kind indicate that, even in regard to the most elementary questions, honorable members opposite have not made themselves acquainted with the Constitution. I should like to have seen included a provision by which the senators could he elected on a basiswhichwas contemplated by those who framed seclion 7. It is quite impossible for a candidate for t he Senate to get in touch with the electors over such an enormous area as he seeks to represent. The result is that Senate candidates devote their energies principally to the cities, towns, and other large centres of population. If provision were made for dividing up States, I have not the slightest doubt that itwould bring the senators more in touch with the people. Let me point out what is likely to arise in the very near future. </para>

            <para>- For the information of honorable members opposite, and at their invitation, I was about to explain that in time to come the members of both Houses of this Parliament need not necessarily be elected at the same time. Assuming that there is an election for this House at the end of next year, there may not, and would not, in the ordinary course, be an election for the Senate at the same time. Then, assuming that this House, when re-elected, runs for three years, as fixed by the Constitution, in the interval an election for the Senate must necessarily take place. It cannot be deferred until the date for the next election of the members of this House. &#34; Therefore, the result will be that in time to come - necessarily, I might almost say - the members of the two Houses will not be elected on the same day. What will the position be unless provision is made for the division of the States into electorates for the purpose of Senate elections ? In the country districts there will be comparatively little interest in the Senate elections, but in the cities and big towns to which the candidates will direct their chief attention, attention will be given, and the result will be that the members of the Senate will be largely elected by the city and town interests. That shows the great importance of taking in hand at an early date the division of the States into electorates for the purpose of Senate elections as contemplated by section 7 of the Constitution Act. </para>

            <para>- No, but I am indicating what is desirable in the Bill, and I am not afraid to express my opinion. The honorable member for West Sydney, who, I think, gave the other side away entirely in their attitude to this Bill, said he had never heard of an Electoral Bill being introduced in the early life of a Parliament, except on one occasion by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid. He stated that an Electoral Bill was generally introduced towards the close of a Parliament. As a large number of honorable members opposite admit the necessity of amending the electoral law, and so are going to vote for the second reading of the Bill, and as the honorable member for West Sydney also admits, even with his criticism, that amendments in certain directions are necessary, evidently his party believes that the time is not far distant when there will be an appeal to the electors. That shows the wisdom of the present Government in introducing this Bill at this early stage. It shows that the Government is going to prepare itself for an emergency. It shows that the Government is doing its best to have a perfect electoral law in this country. If the Opposition is desirous of securing a perfect electoral law, it should let this Bill get into Committee as quickly as possible, and criticise it there, and so let us prepare for an emergency which may arise. </para>

            <para>- Some of the interjections are highly humorous. If we on this side do not speak we are charged with a conspiracy of silence, and if we do speak we are charged with taking up the time of the House. I wonder what honorable gentlemen on the other side expect us to do. I feel sure that they have not the remotest idea of what they want us to do. I think that while they profess that they want an amendment of the electoral law, they really want the electoral law to stand as it is, believing that in its present form it helps them materially. </para>

            <para>- It has been said that we on this side do not desire that the electors shall be properly enrolled, because the fewer the electors on the roll the more likely we are to succeed. Let us compare the results of the last general election with those of the preceding election. We find that three years ago the party on the other side was returned on rolls not nearly so numerous* as were the rolls in use this year. A change has come about. We, on this side, reflect the popular will ; we were elected on the rolls with a much larger number of names. Personally, I have nothing much to complain about in connexion with the rolls for my electorate. My party polled this time nearly 50 per cent, more votes than was done three years ago, and in connexion with the absentee votes, I polled sixteen votes more than did my opponent. </para>

The honorable member for Grey also referred to another matter, and that was the statement attributed to Mr.Knibbs, that there were 175,000 more names on the electoral rolls than there were persons entitled to vote. </para>

            <para>- I can understand honorable gentlemen on the other side saying, &#34; Put down the money.&#34; Apparently they have plenty of money to put down, unlike the party on this side. We cannot afford to put down 5s. to. inquire into every name that is objected to. In my electorate, on the last occasion, there was a number of names which I felt should be inquired into - on one roll something like 100 names - but I did not feel disposed, and 1 know that my committee did not feel disposed, to go and plank down &#163;25 to have those names inquired into. Why should not information be furnished to the electoral officers, and inquiries be made by them, and, if tire names should be struck off or added, why should a payment of 5s. be the test of public duty ? Moreover, in this measure, the Government has included a provision for the infliction of a fine of &#163;5 upon any person who enters a protest or makes an objection which is not well-founded. That shows that the Government have no desire to -stuff the rolls. Although they are abolishing the os. deposit, they are securing due inquiry in every case by the officials, and are putting such provisions in the Act as will prevent absurd objections and absurd notices being sent in. The honorable member for West Sydney said that the Government, by means of this Bill, were attempting to achieve five things - to abolish Saturday voting, to close the rolls one month before the issue of the writ, to compel voters to sign their names, to restore the postal vote, and to restore the freedom of the press. Apparently, there is a difference even amongst the honorable member&#39;s own part}&#39;, as to three of those things. A number of them now admit that the postal vote should be restored. I wonder what their position was three years ago when it was abolished. I suppose they were flogged in Caucus, and were brought down here and compelled to swallow the measure as introduced. Now they appear to have some little freedom in this connexion. I suppose they consider it discreet and wise to favour the restoration of the postal vote. They see the desirability of reintroducing it, and are anxious to vote for it, while at the same time protecting themselves by saying that it should be limited. </para>

            <para>- If what we are now getting from the other, side is assistance, I do not know what opposition would be. Although the honorable member for West Sydney has criticised the Bill, there is, apparently, a considerable section of his own party in favour of restoring the postal vote - a proposal to which I am absolutely committed. I advocated it throughout the whole of my campaign, and intend to advocate it in the future, although I admit that there should be proper restrictions to prevent abuse. I shall be glad to give my assistance and co-operation in every direction towards achieving that end. The honorable member for West Sydney also criticised the proposal to close the rolls one month before the issue of the writ; but upon that question, also, there appear to be members on the other side who are entirely in accordance with the views of the Government. In fact, one honorable member who spoke from the Opposition benches favoured the closing of the rolls three months previously. </para>

            <para>- That is so. &#34;Under the old law it was compulsory to hold the election on a Saturday. Under the present Bill, the election may be held on any day. Before I had experience in the matter, I was against Saturday polling, but I now view the question with rather an open mind. I am indifferent as to whether the voting takes place on a Saturday or on any other day, and I believe that applies to a number of electors ; but in the country districts, I believe. Saturday suits a large number of voters. </para>

            <para>- I .said that some of them were backing out on these questions. There are some objections to Saturday voting, and the conscientious scruples of certain sections of the electors should be considered. I have met numbers who object to Saturday voting, and unless there aTe strong reasons why the polling should take place on that day, consideration should be given to their views.  Whilst  I favour the adoption of every safeguard to prevent double voting, impersonation, and abuses generally, I am afraid that the proposal to compel voters to sign their names on polling day will not work satisfactorily. I am willing to give it a trial, but I am afraid that in crowded centres, where several thousand electors record their votes at one polling booth, the greatest difficulty will be experienced in making provision to enable them to sign their names. </para>

            <para>- I shall vote for the adoption of what I think will be the best electoral system for the people of Australia. Another proposal criticised by the honorable member for West Sydney was the restoration of the freedom of the press. &#39; I expressed my views on that subject when moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and I notice that even on that question -there is a difference of opinion on the other side. I suppose the Caucus whip has not yet been cracked sufficiently loudly on that point. Before I knew whether I would be returned or not, I expressed myself in favour of the freedom of the press. I may also say that I did not have the assistance of a large number of the Liberal party in connexion with my campaign, although I was allowed a free hand. I fought my own fight, and won it in face of the strong opposition of the then Government. I should like to have seen provisions for preferential voting included in the Bill. In my campaign I strongly advocated preferential voting, which was one of my chief planks in connexion with the electoral law. </para>

            <para>- I can afford to ignore that interjection. I strongly expressed the view that there should be no preelection or selection of candidates by any party. I think it is desirable that both parties should be permitted to put into the field any number of candidates that they think proper. The result would be that proper elimination which would insure that whoever was elected represented the views of the majority of the electors who recorded their votes. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member need not be afraid that this question will not be considered at the proper time, and I hope that when it is considered he will vote for it. It is sometimes said that the system of preferential voting means the. introduction of a&#39; large number of candidates into the field, and it is also stated that candidates working on the same side in the same interest often cause more bitterness than those opposed to it. Pre-selections also often cause a great deal of bitterness and dissatisfaction, but I feel sure that if a number of candidates come into the field, no matter what party they represent, the electors will ultimately select the man who will most suitably represent the views of the constituency. There will be a proper elimination, as I said, and so long as the electors use the system &#39;of preferential voting honestly and fairly, they need have no fear of it. Under present conditions, we may  have  a Labour candidate and a Liberal candidate in the field, and also an Independent, who is wanted by neither party. Often the result of the candidature of the Independent is the return of a member for whom only a minority of the total votes is cast. </para>

            <para>- Under the preferential voting system electors must vote for all the candidates in the order of their preference. At the present time, in Senate elections, electors are compelled to vote for three candidates. I hope that, at the proper time, provision will be made in the Bill for the adoption of preferential voting. There are many other matters with which I should like to deal, but I do not wish to occupy time unduly. If we desire a pure roll and a good electoral system, we should approach the consideration of this measure in a proper spirit. To my mind, the measure is a very plain one, and its provisions are worthy of careful and deliberate study, but so many bogies have been raised by honorable members opposite, so many obstacles erected, so many awful possibilities pictured, that I may say of the speeches of the Opposition, that they have - </para>

            <para>- Honorable members on the other side are all alike; but, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> knowing the honorable member for Werriwa as well as you do, you must be of opinion that there is some strong chain holding him down. How the party keeps him silent God Almighty knows; I do not. Some spell has been thrown over him. Possibly he has been told that if he does not keep quiet during this Parliament, he will never again get the Liberal indorsement. That is the only whip with which they could scourge him successfully; because he loves to be in the midst of a fight. When the first Electoral Bill was introduced,  no  one spoke more loudly than he in denunciation of certain proposals that are now being brought forward again. There is a conspiracy of silence on the part of honorable members opposite. Either they have been struck dumb, or they have been struck comical. The honorable member for Indi has broken away, evidently because he felt that he must say something. Like a bird escaped from the cage, he was bursting with song, and had to get it off his chest or die. When honorable members who now support the Government were in Opposition, we had to listen and suffer in silence to what the Prime Minister has characterized as &#34; hog-wash &#34; and &#34; drivel.&#34; We remember, too, the tirade of abuse which the honorable member for Werriwa, in the early days of Federation, used to pour on Protectionists; but he has now become a strong Protectionist, and today is like a little Pomeranian dog, ready to follow his master or mistress anywhere that they may call him. I should like to hear what he has to say regarding certain clauses of the Bill. </para>

Now is the time to deal with the general principles of the Bill. This measure, instead of being one to amend the Electoral Act, is a Bill to keep persons from getting on the roll, and to strike names off the roll, and the Honorary Minister in introducing it used language such as I have never before heard in this or any other Parliament. I would remind the honorable gentleman that, while the two parties sit on opposite sides of the House, the members of this party, and those with whom they associate are not criminals, although he would have the country believe that -we are connected with all that is bad.

          <para>The records of the Courts bear witness to that fact. This country is the most honest on the face of the globe, yet, as in every other country, there are in Australia a certain number of persons who are ready to commit offences against the law. We had in  1911-  the last year for which particulars are available - 144,764 convictions in the Police Courts of this country, and  2,631  committals for trial. These were not serious offences; they were trifling Police Court offences. But the fact remains that a proportion of these men who will commit trifling offences against the law, might be led to commit what they might regard as trifling offences against the electoral system if they thought that honorable members opposite were in danger. Nobody believed at the last general election that honorable members  opposite  were in danger. . . . Since then some of these people have, unfortunately, found out the way to commit these petty crimes,  and  have learned of the safety accompanying any such breach of the law. We have had the newspapers full of the opportunities for fraud given by the present electoral system. Every one is now educated up to the opportunities for fraud which it offers. </para>

        <para>Unfortunately, the honorable member for West Sydney then asked if the Honorary Minister was in order. Had the honorable gentleman been allowed to go on without interruption, he would have convicted himself out of his own mouth. I know what he intended to say, though he did not say it. It is playing it pretty low down for honorable members to speak of their opponents as consorting with thieves, rogues, and vagabonds. How does he know that those to whom he refers would vote for the Labour party instead of for the Liberal party. If he and those supporting the Ministry believe what he said of us, they have no right to associate with us i.u any way, nor to have anything to do with us. I do not think that there is any difference between honorable members opposite and those on this side, except that on political matters they think in one way, while we hold entirely opposite views. I would be sorry to fasten on them every crime in the calendar, as the Honorary Minister tried to fasten evil upon us. Every one is free to vote as he chooses; and if any honorable members on this side have to depend for support on criminals or drunkards, our position is not very stable in this Chamber. The Honorary Minister would have been welladvised to drop such talk as he indulged in when introducing this Bill. The honorable member for Indi finds a &#34; peg &#34; in  what honorable members on this side have said in regard to the postal and preferential voting. When the honorable member was speaking I interjected, &#34; One swallow does not make a summer &#34; ; and, as a matter of fact, the  vapourings  of honorable members opposite have nothing in them. They tell us that we are Caucus-bound, and that we are bound to vote here as the Caucus dictates. Times out of number I have told honorable members that, beyond the Labour platform, the Caucus has no right to bind me in any way.  </para>

            <para>- I never voted for a duty on bananas. I introduced that proposal for a Queensland colleague of mine, who was asleep at the time, but I voted against it; and the honorable member should not twit me when he knows that was only a joke. No one knows better than yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that we on this side are free to vote as we like outside the Labour platform. I feel that the pledge I gave ray constituents has to be honoured just as I would honour any promissory note I had indorsed. When I go on to a public &#39;platform and say that I am willing to carry out certain reforms, I am prepared to prove my sincerity by signing my name, as it were, to a promissory note to my constituents. Beyond the Labour platform, however, I am quite free, as can be shown in several instances. The Honorary Minister made a great parade about the Labour party&#39;s disloyalty, because of the fact that they did not subscribe to the Queen&#39;s Memorial; and, as showing the freedom that we have, I may say that I was the only Labour member who voted for that proposal, and that not a single member- of my party has said one word to me about the occurrence. Then, in regard to the Bill before us, there is nothing to prevent my supporting postal voting if I feel inclined to do so; but, as a matter of fact, I do not believe in the system. I think it is one of the most rotten pieces of machinery ever invented in any country. I have lived a long time in the State iu which postal voting originated, and I have seen some peculiar things done under it. I plead guilty to the soft impeachment of having done some myself. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I found out how a voter was going to vote, and, if he did not vote as J. wanted, his vote did not go in. I know very well what can be done, and that is the reason I am against postal voting. Some honorable members take exception to my remarks about justices of the peace. The honorable member for Darling Downs knows as well as any man that the Philp Government, when they ousted the Kidston Government, appointed political justices of the peace by the score, and in no electorate was this more glaring than in that of the honorable member I have mentioned. Every canvasser of the People&#39;s Political League, as it was then called - the &#34; People&#39;s Political Leg-puller &#34; - was made a justice of the peace. These men went canvassing from door to door, and frightened women into voting by post, pointing out that if they did not do so their husbands would lose their jobs. But as soon as the Government were returned, what was their first act ? Every justice of the peace created under the Philp <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> - and they numbered over 300 - was wiped off the rolls, and a fresh start made. </para>

            <para>- It was done, and no one knows better than the Minister of Trade and Customs what corruption took place. The newspaper with which that honorable gentleman&#39;s relatives are associated denounced the system with &#34; bell, book, and candle,&#34; and the newspaper files of the Library will show what his family thought about it. Yet we find the honorable member in a Government which seeks to perpetuate this evil. </para>

It was my desire to get my friend in, and I can tell the honorable member &#34;that I worked hard, got him in, and kept him there. Under the Queensland Act, justices of the peace are done away with altogether; and this brings me back to what I said about political justices of the peace being rotten wretches. If honorable members knew some of the things those justices of the peace have done, they would agree that the words used are not strong enough : in fact, I am sorry I did not call them something stronger. Some of the acts they perpetrated at the 1907 election were something awful; indeed, honorable members opposite would scarcely believe what was done.

        <para class="block">As to the sick and infirm, I have no objection to their having a vote. Honorable members on both sides believe that every qualified man and woman should be able to exercise the franchise; but what makes me so suspicious about, the postal vote is the corruption that has taken place. In one electorate, a justice of the peace went round with a canvasser, and told the wives of working men that it was quite easy to avoid the bustle of the polling booth by signing a postal vote, and that, in a few days, they would come round with the necessary witness. There were peculiar ways of finding out how these people voted. I do not wish to tell honorable members what I know, because I am familiar with the game from A to Z. As I told honorable members before, I have been at it, and know very well what is in it. </para>

          <para>The justice of the peace has degenerated. In former years there was an old-fashioned feeling that the justice of the peace was created to hold impartially the scales of justice. In hundreds of cases justices of the peace are party political agents. There is little, if any, disguise about it ; avowedly in many instances they are appointed to their judicial position for political purposes. It is but natural in these circumstances that abuses will result. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Indi raved and ranted &#34; this afternoon about purity of elections. All that he wanted, he said, was to insure the purity of elections - that no name should appear on the roll that ought not to be there, and that no one should vote who was not entitled to vote. There is no virtue about that. Our electoral law is the freest in the world. Every man and woman of the full age of twenty-one years has the right to be on the roll and to vote. </para>

            <para>- I would tell the honoralbe member that my experience is that it is a difficult matter to get many people to vote once, let alone twice, at an election. In many instances constituents of mine have ridden 70, 80, and up to 100 miles in order to vote for me. In my electorate, hundreds of miles intervene between polling booths. Every man and woman has a right to be enrolled. If they are resident in Australia, their names ought to appear upon some roll; and I maintain that they should not be struck off one roll until they have been transferred to another. They, are residents of the Commonwealth, and have as much right to be upon the roll as has the Attorney-General, whose fixed residence is Melbourne. Their names should not be removed from the roll until it is plain that they have been transferred to another roll, or that they have left the Commonwealth. </para>

He defied honorable members to show how they could give a postal vote and not open the door to a wholesale interference with the secrecy of the ballot. The great objection to that vote was that when an elector took his ballot-paper to some place away from scrutineers and the returning officer, political agents and employers&#39; agents would be after him to see he voted in the right way.

At Mosman the work of revising the rolls has proved, very unsatisfactory.

            <para>- A vote sent by post is a postal vote. The very organizations for which honorable members opposite barrack, have decided to abandon the postalvoting system so far as the selection of candidates is concerned. They are going to do what the late Right Honorable Charles Cameron Kingston, when speaking on the first Electoral Bill submitted in this Chamber, counselled us to do. He urged that the only means of getting a true reflex of public opinion was by inducing every elector to go to the ballot-box. Some honorable members opposite have endeavoured to make capital out of the fact that one or two honorable members upon this side of the House have said that they agree with postal voting. If the postal voting system could be properly safeguarded, there is no member of. the Labour party who would desire to prevent the sick or infirm from exercising the franchise. But knowing, as we do, the way in which the system was abused in Queensland, we should be lacking in our duty if we agreed to its restoration here. </para>

I hope that there are in this Chamber a sufficient number of honorable members of my way of thinking to turn down that proposal. </para>

The honorable gentleman says that there are to be duplicate papers, and that the butts must be signed by the electors. Before he put forward this proposal he should have held a mock election amongst the seventy-five members of this Chamber.

            <para>- I would wager &#163;50 with the Attorney-General that at an election at which there .are a hundred votes cast, under his butt system I will tell him how fifty of the electors voted. If that does not destroy the secrecy of the ballot, I do not know what does. It does not matter whether you put the number on the front or the back of the paper, because, if the scrutineers desire it, they can handle every ballot-paper that comes out of the ballot-box, and it is the easiest thing in the world to make a note. If I wanted to know how you voted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and I was scrutineer at a booth where you voted, all I should have to do would be to put the number which appeared on the front or back of your ballotpaper opposite your name on my copy of the roll. I think I should have enough brain power to keep twenty or thirty cases in my head until the votes were recounted. The secrecy of the ballot must be maintained at all, costs; otherwise, we might as well go back to open voting, and compel voters to range themselves on sides, as we did in the days of old, when every elector had to go to the polling booth and declare himself openly. This system of signing the butts is about as old as the hills, and has been found defective. Suppose that half-a-dozen men came and voted in the name of James Page at different polling booths in Melbourne. Unless the election was disputed, how could any one find out who was the rightful voter? I wish to deal with the matter of removing names from the electoral roll. I have seen many instances of people who have been residing in one place for thirty years, and whose&#39; names have been removed from the roll. Only to-day I heard of people who have written down to their representative, telling him that they had received notice that their names were to be struck off the roll. If the members of my party had been imbued with the same feelings as I am, the Government would never have obtained Supply last week until they undertook to lay aside the regulation under which these objections have been entertained. A more unjust one I never heard of in my life. We seem to be returning to the condition of things that prevailed in the old days, when the Pastoralists&#39; Union.&#39; and other organizations used to send in wholesale objections to persons to whom they were opposed in politics. A person objected to could not go to the appointed place and prove his claim, and it was not permitted to an agent to go to the Court and speak for him. The same sort of evils are being perpetrated to-day. I will fight this Bill at every stage, as long as it contains provisions enabling people to be deprived of their just rights. What reasonable objection is there to the 5s. deposit ? The honorable member for Indi told us that he knew of 100 names that ought to come off the roll, but that neither he nor his organization could afford to put up &#163;25 to strike them off. The honorable member must have thought that he was talking to a bush audience, instead of to a body of legislators. He ought to know that if these objections were upheld the whole of the money would be returned to him. But if the objections were shown to be frivolous, not only would the 5s. in each case be forfeited, but the objector would be liable to be fined <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5.</inline></para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Parkes has an opportunity of telling us what he believes to be the right method, if only he will get up and speak. Is it the intention of honorable members opposite to deprive the people of the secrecy of the ballot by introducing the postal voting system and the butt system ? If not, there is but one alternative. There is no member of this House who does not want a pure roll. But -the roll on which the last election was fought was good enough for honorable members opposite. It gave them their brutal majority, by means of which they are able to &#34;  swang  &#34; it over us every day. It ought to be good enough for them in the future. It certainly is good enough for us. I shall have more to say on the subject in Committee. </para>

          <para>.- I propose to offer a few remarks if the silence of honorable members opposite is to be maintained. But if any one of them would like to explain a Bill that has not yet-, been satisfactorily explained, I shall be only too happy to give way. Each hon.orable member opposite seems to know enough about the Bill to enable him to interject, though incapable of explaining his meaning in a speech. It would be interesting to find out which Minister is in charge of the measure. It was introduced by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, but during the last two weeks he has hardly been in the chamber ten minutes. We are somewhat at a loss to understand who is really in charge of the Bill, who is making a note of what is said about it, and who will guide its course in Committee. Possibly Ministers and their supporters, revelling in their present majority, are indifferent to the references made to the subject on this side, and to appeals for justice, or even for the observance of an ordinary sense of decency. Apparently, they have decided that a certain course is to be followed, and we must put up with the consequences, merely hoping that the time is not far distant when circumstances may be somewhat changed. The penultimate  speaker  opened his remarks by the suggestion that we should accept this Bill in a Christian spirit, refrain from adverse&#34; criticism, even with the object of effecting improvements, and let it go through. He referred to some members on our side who had ventured into his electorate, even including my humble self. It is true that I was invited by some hundreds of citizens in that part of the Commonwealth to visit them and address them. I have been invited to go there again. I feel disposed to accept the invitation. But when the honorable member asserts, as he did, that he won his election in the most open and upright manner, I feel concerned to remind him that there is on record one instance in particular of where his conduct was not such as he alleges it to have been. I have before me a copy of the Wangaratta <inline font-style="italic">Chronicle,</inline> of 24th May, published just one week before the day of the election. Consequently, any statement published in it had just about time enough to circulate in the district, without permitting an answer to appear. If this statement is typical of the political criticism in which the honorable member indulged at this or subsequent or previous meetings, his statement of to-day must go by the wall, because it will not hold water. For instance, the honorable member is reported in this newspaper to have said - </para>

          <para>At the Hobart Labour Conference of last year was formulated the policy of the Government for this election. A proposal was brought forward that the present Federal exemption of  &#163;5,000  should be wiped out and no exemption at a|l allowed.

            <para>- The honorable gentleman will not deny the report; he will not admit it, and he seeks to prevaricate by an assertion of his own respecting myself. He being present, and at liberty to deny it or accept it, as the case may be, I feel justified in calling attention to that particular view. The land tax was one of those subjects with which certain honorable gentlemen wickedly deceived the electors. Their allegations in respect of it were of a most wretched and most shocking description, and, in the direction referred to, deplorable. The statement warning the farmers as to the narrow shave by which they escaped being subjected to a land tax without an exemption is an indication, at any rate, that some statement of that description was made. If honorable members will turn to the official report of the proceedings of the Conference referred to - a report which, I presume, the honorable gentleman has had, because he referred to it a few weeks ago in remarks he made - they will find, on page- 14, that that particular proposal was defeated by 18 votes to 6, and not, as alleged by him, by the narrow shave of one vote. It was by methods of that description that he won his election, and he asserted that he won it in a fair, upright, honorable way, deserving of the praise of all sections of the community, with a modesty which, I am sure, commended itself to honorable members on both sides. In the circumstances, he was justified in saying that he cared neither for the hosts of heaven nor for the hosts of the other place. He could win, I admit, if he followed a course of that kind. We are asked, for instance, why we do not approach this Bill in a Christian-like spirit, why we do not show ourselves amenable to reason, which, we can only, assume, is in the other side, for few of them venture to address the House. We are asked to consider a particular Bill. We consider the Bill as it is put before the House. If it is a Bill which permits of a Christian-like criticism and forbearance, necessarily it will receive it; but if it is a Bill specifically designed to do injury to the country, it naturally follows that honorable members who believe it to be of that description will receive it in no friendly spirit. Even if the Bill were of the character suggested, even if it were mild in its provisions, we are justified, in the circumstances, in criticising it; indeed, in criticising the Minister on the other side on the spirit in which he presented the Bill to the House. He presented it to the House in a blackguardly utterance  </para>

            <para>- Then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I withdraw the offence again. I am sorry that I have offended; but, in the circumstances, you will see that honorable members are justified in displaying a little warmth of feeling. When, on top of that conduct, the honorable member for Indi - a novice in the House, but not a novice in years nor in legal procedure - suggests in words that are calculated to mislead the community, that we ought to meet this Bill in a Christian-like spirit; when we are being subjected to this kind of insult daily, in particular by Ministers, and being misrepresented daily at socials, banquets, or other sorts of gatherings by the Prime Minister, then there is room for exception being taken to such conduct in words that cannot possibly be misunderstood. The honorable member for Indi regrets, he interjects, that there is not an illustrated <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I am sure I do not know why he wishes the publication to be illustrated. If these words of the Minister, whom he tamely follows, are not sufficient embellishment, do not in themselves form a sufficiently dirty picture, I do not know what more he desires. Now, so far as the Bill itself is concerned, in the few moments that are allowed to honorable members for its consideration, nothing like detail is possible, yet we may indulge in a few general references. We were led to believe, by the first line of the Ministerial statement, that a major alteration of the Electoral Act would be suggested, for that line reads - </para>

        <para class="block">That is a complete sentence, composed before any inquiry had been made, before anything in respect of the elections was known other than that honorable gentlemen on the other side, though representing a minority of the electors, have yet a majority in this House. Before any irregularities were proved, before, indeed, the inquiry in relation thereto was- finalized, the electoral roll had not been found to be satisfactory. One would think that honorable gentlemen opposite, embracing in their numbers, as they do, some nine or ten members of the legal profession - men who &#39;assert that they are of high business standing, who arrogate to themselves almost the sole right of governing and legislating for this country, and who refer to honorable members- on this side as being quite incapable of rising to the sublime heights of understanding political economy - would have some reasonable proof behind them before asserting that a thing was unsatisfactory; at any rate, a proof acceptable to the average and unbiased elector. But from that day until this, despite the few speeches that have been made, notwithstanding the columns that have appeared in their party newspapers, they have not been able to prove in the Electoral Act one unsatisfactory feature, so far as the last elections were concerned. All that they are entitled to attempt to do, by reason of their hustings pledges, is to re-institute the postal vote. Outside of that particular feature there is scarcely one clause in the Bill that embodies any of the references or pledges they have made to their electors. Of course, the Electoral Act is unsatisfactory to honorable members opposite because they have not a majority in both Houses of the Legislature. Only an Electoral Act which will give them, by preferential or some other form of voting, by splitting up the Senate seats, by striking names off or putting them on the roll, by having the electorates divided by Commissioners or by a Supreme Court Judge, by absent voting or postal voting, or any other method, what they term a workable majority in both branches of the Legislature, will be satisfactory to them, and then only will they be mute so far as suggestions for its alteration are concerned. It is sad, indeed, that the Electoral Act of this country should be made the plaything of political parties. If, at the moment that either party receives a chance majority in either branch of the Legislature, they are there and then to seek to alter the Electoral Act to suit their party purposes, it will be a sad day, for we shall go down to the low level of some of the smaller American States, where these matters, together with all Civil Service matters, are regularly manipulated for party purposes after each election. What can be said of this Bill, introduced immediately following an election, when uo irregularity has been disclosed, when not one member on the other side has produced a scintilla of evidence, outside of the restoration of the postal voting provision which they promised to their electors, to justify any alteration whatever? </para>
        <para class="block">Despite all the powers of the Government, which have been used during the last three months - detectives, officials, unlimited money - after every inquiry that could possibly be conceived of has been made, they have failed to find one irregularity, one justification for any alteration. Yet they submit the Bill to us in a form which clearly indicates that it has been introduced wholly and solely for party purposes. The main features of the alterations which are proposed have emanated, not from the brains of honorable members opposite, but from their political leagues, from the machines that control the elections, from those people who understand the practical working of every-day elections, and who want to make the Electoral Act such that they can escape the. penal provisions, and do whatever seems to them best to get a majority for their side. The question of whether every human being is allowed to vote is of no consideration to them. If they are so solicitous about the women voting, why do not their party in this State extend the franchise for the Legislative Council to women ? If they are so anxious that their women should speak at &#39;the electoral booths, and have a voice in the government of the country, why not give them the right more fully? Why not give it to them in all the States, where to-day they are debarred specifically and persistently by the very political element which is facing us to-day ? The cry about giving women the vote is about the most hollow sham ever imposed on a community by honorable . members on the other side. In Victoria, there still remains a form of plural voting for men,  and they seek no alteration of it. As I say, the idea has emanated from the political leagues outside. It is an indication of a desire to manipulate elec-, tions, to remove some names from the rolls, to be able at some special times, when their Ministry happens to be in office to identify particular electors, and enable canvassers to go from door to door and solicit votes. They know that canvassers can mislead and deceive, obtaining votes from persons who do not give much attention to politics, and who are liable to be misled bv forceful or untruthful arguments. They know that they can mislead the electors, for instance, by such wretched statements as that a proposal to alter the land tax was defeated by the warrow majority of one, when it was really defeated by eighteen votes to six ! They know that the efforts of these canvassers are systematically directed to mislead and misrepresent. They want to be able to pay their canvassers, men and women ; degrading women as they do day by day, by paying them to <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> round and mislead the electors. They want to be able to canvass the electorates and get votes by hundreds, as many can get them, not because the average voter is venal, not because he wants to do wrong, but because if men and women sufficiently strong-minded and sufficiently unscrupulous go from door to door, innocent and uninformed electors can be misled <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> many ways. That class of electioneering can be indulged in only by those who have abundant wealth, those to whom money is no object, and who, if they do not manipulate all the funds that come in, know full well that the wealthy institutions of the country send money in by hundreds of pounds to aid in the election of honorable members opposite, or to defeat referenda proposals, which would give the people a fuller privilege of selfgovernment. This Bill was conceived in viciousness, delivered in venom, and presented in vilification by its unmarried parents. The four great corner stones on which it is proposed to erect this safe retreat for electoral thieves, are deprivation of electoral rights, curtailment of political power, violation of the secrecy of the ballot-box, and opening up avenues for fraud. Whatever be the desire of individual honorable members on the other side, it is utterly impossible for them to raise on such a foundation any superstructure that can be either honorable to the builders, or perfect in its parts. Yet honorable members on the other side, knowing full well all the possibilities&#39; under the Bill, knowing whence it in reality emanates, propose to continue pushing it before the House, not that they have any real hope of it passing, not that they believe that its provisions will meet with final legislative assent by both branches of the Legislature, but because they think that by its provisions they can mislead a section of the community into believing that something is wrong with the Electoral Act. </para>

            <para>- The cry on the other side is, &#34;For Heaven&#39;s sake, do not speak. Let us get into Committee, where you are not fully reported. Do not expose our intentions and desires to the public. Say nothing. Let it be a policy of hush, silence, and suppression. Get into Committee. Let it go.&#34; Does the honorable member wish me to go back over the last three years, when from this corner, he regularly delivered orations of unlimited length on all and sundry subjects, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dick</inline> with King Charles&#39; head, never forgetting the Pacific Cable business in every speech. Indeed, so long and laborious were his utterances, that it was he that constrained us to propose a time limit, for, although we love to hear him, there was nothing truly edifying in his laboured efforts. It, therefore, ill-becomes him, on this occasion, to suggest that we should go into Committee, when but a few honorable members have had the privilege of speaking, and all have been subjected to a time limit. It is proposed in the Bill that the boundaries of the electoral divisions should be delineated no longer by a Commission of three, including the Surveyor-General of the particular State, but by a Judge of a Supreme Court or the High Court. First of all, we may doubt whether the Judges have the time for this work. Secondly, unless they call expert evidence and go into the question very minutely, as this practically embraces a new sphere of employment for them, it will be impossible for them to do the work in a reasonable way. Another serious objection to a Judge  alone having the right to do this work is that one of the matters to be considered is diversity, or community, of interest, and I would suggest for the consideration of honorable members opposite that it is not meet that we should mix our Judges up in that matter. </para>

        <para class="block">Let us keep them pure and above the reach of everything and everybody that can improperly influence them. Do not let us ask them to decide questions affecting community of interest or similar matters which are not dealt with on evidence or according to law. They should not have that task assigned to them. But while it may not be of great importance who does the work of subdivision, the method under which it is done is of importance. The Ministry of the day can submit the redistribution of a State to the Judge, practically whenever they like. If the Bill became law, they could ask for the redistribution of New South Wales, Victoria, or any or all of the States whenever they so. desired. If, after their hustings utterances, the Government were proposing to take the redistribution of States altogether out of the hands of Parliament, we might regard them as sincere, and as believing what they told the electors about the need for that step; but the right of Parliament to interfere with the redistribution rs not taken away. After the Judge has decided the new electoral boundaries, his redistribution must come before Parliament, and if either branch of the Legislature - not as heretofore, both branches of the Legislature - disagrees, the Ministry can do what they like in the matter. In this provision we see their  Machiavelian  cunning. Ministers happen to have a majority in this House. If either branch of the Legislature disapproves of the work of the Judge, what happens? This is the worst feature of the provision ! The proposed redistribution is thrown holus-bolus into the hands of the Ministry, who can do what they like with it. It has been said that the last Government prevented a redistribution of the State of New South Wales, but the statement is grossly false. There was a redistribution in accordance with the law. It was submitted to Parliament for review, and returned to the Commissioners. Redistributions were submitted by the Commissioners on two separate occasions, and then the Liberals, finding that the scheme proposed was favorable to them, because its adoption would increase their numbers and decrease ours, went so far as to hold up the business of Parliament for fifty-four consecutive hours, or thereabouts, to force its acceptance, despite the assurance that was given that it would be approved. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to be unfair. Even were the honorable member a regular attendant, he might not quite understand ; though I shall not stress that point too much. The assurance waa given by Ministers. Although, having a majority in both branches of the Legislature, we had the power to prevent the acceptance of the &#39;redistribution, and although we knew that it was inimical to our interests, because it would bring about the reduction of our following, we passed it. Note the difference between what we did and what was done earlier by the Liberal party. When the last Fusion Government were in power, in 1909, it became necessary to redistribute the divisions of Western Australia, and independent Commissioners made a report to Parliament. The. then Minister of Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fuller,</inline> as in duty bound, moved the adoption of that report. Then what happened. These immaculate gentlemen, whose honour transcends anything previously known in the political life of this Commonwealth, voted or paired against the scheme to a man, the Minister of Home Affairs alone voting for it. What did they care then about a fair redistribution, or about one man one vote of one value? What sense of honour, decency, or uprightness did they then show? They were playing the political game. </para>

            <para>- I shall not do so; but it has a close relationship to the provision under discussion. Every Liberal member and Minister alike voted or paired against the scheme, because it would have lost to the. party the then member for Fremantle, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges.</inline> Did they send back the scheme to the Commissioners for reconsideration ? No. That would have been too much risk. It was quietly put into a pigeon-hole in the Minister&#39;s office, and their adherent was saved. These are the gentlemen who to-day bring forward a provision under which they would be able to do the same thing again. After this House, and they have a majority here now, has disagreed with the proposals of the Judge - and the majority will disagree with them if they are not suitable or satisfactory to the party; because we must judge of the future by what has happened in the past - they will do as they did in 1909, and stamp it out of sight. Well might the honorable member for Wimmera say, &#34; Do not speak. Let us hush it all up, and rush&#39; the Bill into Committee.&#34; They do not desire the exposure of these proposals to the public view, so that the people may understand their evil possibilities. </para>

I am not an embryo lawyer, nor yet the finished article; but, while I do not like to be unkind to the honorable member, it is possible that if I were the finished article I could earn my living, whereas he cannot earn cheese. If the House disagrees, then the Ministry have full control. If it suits the Ministry the report may go back to the Commissioner; but, if not, then the report does not go back. As in 1909, when the Fremantle seat was in danger, the Government, with the knowledge of what they are doing, may pigeon-hole the proposals, and the Commissioner will never see them again. Despite all the utterances about the purity of elections, and the necessity for taking the control out of the hands of Parliament, this has been done. Paragraph 5 of the clause is as follows : - </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Once again we see the cunning which drafted this paragraph. It is quite possible that a by-election now would upset either side of the House. A resignation or death on this side might mean a very substantial majority for the Government if they won the seat; whereas, a death or resignation opposite might mean the Government and their supporters coming over here. This particular paragraph is so framed that, no matter how the electorates may be divided in the next two or three years, no by-election can be conducted under the new provisions. The Ministry, to the extent to which they canmake themselves safe under this provision, have done so; and yet all the time they keep talking about using their power to protect the people. There is another proposal to which I desire to call attention. It is proposed, by an amendment of section 64, to prevent the registration of names within one month before the issue of the writs. At present, a person desiring to become an elector may register up to the day of issue; and not a word of justification has been said for the proposed alteration other than that the electoral officers allege they have scarcely time to get the rolls into reasonable condition. During the last thirteen years, however, the officers have been able to do this work; and we  know that within the period of one month before the issue of the writs many thousands of electors register their names on the rolls. This provision is specifically drafted to prevent a large number of people from having their names recorded. In the excitement immediately preceding an election hundreds of people, good citizens in the best sense of the word, who have not previously taken the precaution, awake to a knowledge of their responsibilities and seek to be placed on the roll.. The Honorary Minister ought to have been honest with us, and brought down a statement showing the number of persons who, during the last thirteen years, have had their names recorded within the specified month. There is, however, a policy of silence and secrecy that is almost appalling - a policy of hush permeates the whole of the Government side. Had the Minister given us this information, we should have been able to show clearly that tens of thousands of electors do suddenly awake to their responsibilities, and in the vast majority of cases they become the most active of voters. There may be no clear notification when the writs will be issued, and hundreds of electors, in the case of an unscrupulous Ministry issuing them a week or ten days earlier than expected, may find themselves disfranchised. All the time we have honorable members opposite crying about the purification of the rolls, and their desire to give every elector the opportunity to exercise a franchise. They are fair of promise, but false in deed. The result of this Bill will be to deprive many thousands of electors of their rights. Whose loss this will be I cannot say; but I am confident that those from whom this measure emanated are under the impression that the majority of the electors .so registering their names are not favorable to them, or we should certainly not have had such a provision suggested. I hope sincerely that honorable members opposite will be true to their professions, and afford every facility to properly qualified persons to enroll, and subsequently to record their votes. Here, however, we find a specific provision to prevent very many thousands from voting. Another peculiar provision is that declaring that citizens shall not be allowed to register their names for one month prior to the issue of the writs, whilst the leagues which control honorable members opposite will continue, without responsibility or penalty of any description, to object to names already on the roll, and to have them struck off right up to the very day on which the writs are issued. Am I not justified, in the circumstances, in saying that this Bill has been drafted with a cunning that is almost  Machiavelian  ? How will this provision affect a citizen who has been six months in the Commonwealth, or who has reached his majority a day or two before the issue of the writs? All these will be deprived of the right to vote. Many of our young people, I am glad to say, are taking an active interest in politics. With the spread of education they are obtaining a better knowledge of political economy. Hence the gradual increase in the strength of our voting power, although, for the moment, it is not adequately reflected in this Chamber. I have in my mind&#39;s eye at the present moment some young men of eighteen, nineteen, and twenty years of age, who are looking forward eagerly to the time when they will be able to record their votes. For long they have been active political workers. But these young men may become of age, perhaps, just a few days before the date of the issue of the writs, and honorable members opposite, who prate of their desire to extend the facilities for voting, will say to them, under this measure, &#34; You cannot vote at this election; you ought to have come of age a few weeks earlier.&#34; Then we may have a citizen pf repute who desires to record his vote, but who, a month prior to the issue of the writs, has not been in the Commonwealth for quite six months, and, therefore, will be deliberately prevented from .securing enrolment. This is a provision which necessarily means strengthening the position of honorable members opposite. As Conservatives they naturally desire for this House a conservative or limited roll, like those relating to their Legislative Councils - so limited, indeed, that but few Democrats will be able to enter. Whilst they seek that degree of conservatism which will prevent people from getting on the rolls, they desire, also, to secure a power that will enable them to remove names from the roll right up to the date of the issue of the writs. If the one proposal were fair and honest, why should it not be applied to the other ? Why not say that political leagues, also, shall not be allowed to lodge objections to names on the roll within one month of the date of the issue of the writs ? The whole Bill has been framed for specific party purposes, and there is underlying it an intention that does not reflect credit on those responsible for it. There is, first of all, the intention to deprive people of  the  right to vote by preventing them from securing enrolment, and, secondly, the intention to deprive them of the right to vote by a rigid system of striking names off the roll once they have been put on. This is but a return to the old methods, which we thought had been dead for twenty years. Indeed, such methods are dead in some countries ; but, because honorable members opposite have been suddenly returned to power by the narrowest of majorities, and with a minority of the votes of the. people behind them, they have seized the first opportunity to carry back our electoral procedure twenty-five or fifty years - to drag us back practically to the days which we thought we had left behind, for ever. </para>

            <para>- We see at once the desire of honorable members opposite underlying this measure. We can read, so to speak, into their minds and hearts. This Bill lays bare their intentions. Every line of it is stamped with conservatism, rank and rampant. It shows that they would, if they dared, have this House and the Senate like the Legislative Councils of the States. The leading man behind this measure is one who, but a year or two ago, having a majority behind him in both branches of the State Legislature, deliberately robbed certain people of their votes because they dared to differ from him on political questions. Here we have honorable members opposite, who arrogate to themselves knowledge, culture, education, and all that go to make up the individual fit to take part in the deliberations of the National Parliament, seeking to institute an electoral system so conservative as to make honest men blush. We can readily see the condition of mind into which they have fallen. A moment or two ago, when it was suggested that the Bill should be withdrawn, the honorable member for Kooyong laughed scornfully at the idea of withdrawing a measure which is going to help his side so materially. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member laughed at the idea of withdrawing &#171;. Bill which is going to chock thousands of useful citizens - without whose assistance and labour many Government supporters would not bask so happily as they do to-day in the sunshine of life, in the desire to record their votes. Their names are to be taken off the rolls. Then there is the provision to prevent Saturday being chosen as a polling day. According to the honorable gentleman who introduced this Bill, the reason given by the Electoral Officers is that there is always a great rush after 1 p.m. when the election is held on a Saturday - that the rush is so great as to clog the electoral machinery. If a general election were held on a Friday, instead of there being &#39;a continual rush from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., all those who had been at work from 6, 7, or 8 o&#39;clock in the morning would be rushing to record their votes from 5 to 8 p.m., so that for a couple of hours the congestion would be intensified a hundredfold. The hollowness and shallowness of this pretence is positively nauseating. The Government know that by doing away with Saturday as polling day they will deprive thousands of useful workers - clerks, shop assistants, labourers, mechanics, and artisans - of the right to exercise the franchise. Then, again, those who seek to record their votes are to be called upon to sign the butts of the ballot-papers. Of all the ludicrous, not to say shameful, proposals ever made this is the worst. Imagine elector!? going into a polling place in respect of which 5,000 voters are enrolled, and ha- ing to sign their names in this way before being allowed to vote! Many, unfortunately, are not rapid writers; a small percentage are scarcely able to write at all. So that this proposal that every man and woman, before receiving a ballot-paper, shall sign the ballot-paper butts, discloses either a remarkable peculiarity of imagination or the depths to which honorable members opposite will descend in order to deprive electors of the franchise. There are several other provisions with which I should like to deal, but, as my time has expired, I shall have to reserve, until we reach the Committee stage, my comments on them. </para>

It relates to sugar manufactured from cane which was delivered at the mills and upon which, therefore, bounty has been paid.

            <para>- Approximately, in bond, there were 27,461 tons of raw sugar and 1,768 tons of refined sugar produced from cane delivered for manufacture after the first day of May, and before the 26th day of July of the present year. Then there is the beet sugar, amounting to 29 tons of raw and 424 tons of refined sugar, making a total of 453 tons. Roughly speaking, therefore, the amount in bond was 32,815 tons, upon which duty will have to be collected. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to enter into any thing of a controversial character. In addition to that, the next clause of the resolution declares that the actual amount shall be certified to by the Comptroller-General. The third resolution declares that all cane sugar manufactured in Australia and entered for home consumption after the commencement of the Act is to be deemed to be sugar subject to Excise. Further, &#39; when the duty has been paid, the Act is to cease to operate. The effect of this resolution will be to authorize the collection of revenue upon cane and beet sugar to the amounts respectively* that would have been paid if such a clause had been inserted in the repealing Act. In other words, the effect is just the same as if a continuing clause had been inserted in the repealing Act providing that revenue to these amounts could be collected. We authorize the collection of the revenue to the full extent of the &#163;4 per ton upon all amounts upon which we have paid bounty. </para>

            <para>- We have to add 3,500 tons of sugar in bond from last year, making a total of about 39,500 tons. Of course, these figures can only be taken at present as approximate. The revenue from that will amount to &#163;158,000. This year we have paid bounty to the extent of &#163;114,672. In addition to that, in the other proposed legislation which I propose to circulate, dealing with the additional bounty upon the cane of 2s. 2d., there will be involved another amount of &#163;35,730, which will make the bounty  payable total about &#163;150,402. That includes what has been paid, together with what is promised to be paid. </para>

          <para>.- I have no intention of delaying the introduction of the Bill ; but I think that the Minister might have frankly stated the reason why it is being introduced. For about two months the Government have paraded before the country a statement that their trouble arose out of some fault or failure of the previous Government. It did not. There was before them a Statute, telling them exactly what they could do and what they could not do. The Minister did not say whether the Government had cognisance of the fact chat there was in bond sugar on which bounty had been paid at the time of the issue of the proclamation, and on which they must have known duty ought to have been paid, the sugar not being released by the proclamation. He has not said a word as to whether the Customs officers were invited to give information to the Government before the proclamation was issued. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member has not told us either that Parliament was to re-assemble shortly after the issue of the proclamation. If Ministers had looked at the Act. and seen that it was defective, from their point of view - and it was not defective at all, in my opinion - they could have removed that defect, because Parliament was to meet within sixteen days after the proclamation was issued, and no disturbance could have taken place as regards the collection or non.collection of revenue. In fact, the matter was discussed when the Bill was going through last session in the ordinary course of events. Unfortunately, the last cane season - that is, 1912-13 - yielded a very poor crop. Had it been put on the market, as it ought to have been, it would have been all consumed in Australia before March, and &#34;any proclamation issued between March and the end of June before fresh cane was cut would in ordinary circumstances have been issued at a time when there was no sugar in bond at all, unless some persons were speculating heavily and holding back against a proclamation that might be issued by a Government who would not take care to see that there was no sugar in bond. That is really the position, as the Minister knows, but this is not the time to debate it. I hope that later the Minister will tell us frankly whether he consulted the Customs officers to ascertain what sugar was in bond. The officers must have known as the new sugar was coming in that there must be some in bond. It is carried in bond on the seaboard from the mills to the refineries, and therefore the Government must have been aware of the position if they took any notice of matters at all. Furthermore, this question was discussed in the Queensland Parliament, particularly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillies,</inline> who pointed out to the Commonwealth Government twelve days before they issued their proclamation that they had to take care that the sugar in bond was not allowed to go scot free, because the bounty had already been paid in accordance with the amount of sugar delivered at the mills for manufacture. That is how the matter stands, but I shall wait with pleasure for the second-reading speech of the Minister, when, no doubt, we shall hear more of the facts, and the reason why this proposal has been brought forward. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to know if the Prime Minister can make a statement as to the arrangements in connexion with the welcome that is to be extended to the Fleet at Sydney ? We should be told when the train is to leave Melbourne, so that we may communicate with our friends in regard to the matter. I understand that it is proposed that the special train shall leave on Friday morning. If that is so, it will not be fair to keep us here on Thursday night, because the train will not get to Sydney until early on Saturday morning, and we shall have to walk about in the parks - at any rate, those who have not homes to go to will have to do something of that kind - until the function starts. </para>

A special train will leave for Sydney at 1 o&#39;clock on Friday afternoon, and it will, therefore, be useless for the House to meet on that day, because, to catch the train, honorable members will have to leave here not later than noon.

            <para>- That is a mistake; the statement could not be supported from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records. , It seems to me useless to meet on Friday, because little or no business could be done then. Thursday is the day set apart for private members&#39; business, but I suggest that at 2 o&#39;clock instead of at a quarter past 2, which is the usual hour when we reassemble after luncheon, the Treasurer should be permitted to deliver his Budget. He will probably finish by 4 o&#39;clock, and then honorable members who wish to leave will be free to do so. Of course, there remains to be settled the question how best to accommodate private members&#39; business. As to that, I should be glad to receive a suggestion from the Leader of the Opposition during to-morrow. </para>

Perhaps the best arrangement would be to give up Thursday morning to private members&#39; business. The Treasurer could then make his speech after the luncheon adjournment, after which honorable members might like to go home to get ready for their trip.

On Monday a conference was held there, the outcome of which, according to the newspaper reports, seems to have been that the whole question should be left for the Prime Minister to decide. The press statement of what took place is this - </para>

          <para>The object of the Conference was to discuss the small-pox outbreak and the possibility of removing the quarantine restriction from Sydney. The Conference lasted for more than an hour. AH the members of the Board of Health, which include such well-known figures as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Paton,</inline> Director of Public Health <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline> Normand  McLaurin, Chancellor of the University; and the Lord Mayor, Alderman Cocks, M.L.A., were in favour of the immediate lifting of the quarantine embargo. The Federal representatives, however, were anything but complacent. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What appears to be the desire of this Government is that the embargo shall not be removed until the two Houses of the New South Wales Parliament have passed a law making vaccination compulsory on the people of the State. If the disease is really smallpox, and the Federal Government has the right to compel the people within the affected area to be vaccinated, it has either made a mistake in imposing quarantine or has failed to give effect to its constitutional powers. For this Government to ask the State Parliament to pass a law about which the people of the State have not been consulted, and in regard to which they have not expressed their views, is an unheard-of thing. The National Parliament has no right to tell a State Parliament that it must pass such and such a law. As a member of this Parliament I disclaim any right of that kind. Let the State Parliament act in a constitutional manner, and appeal to the people on the subject. Apparently, the Government, as represented by the Minister of Home Affairs, will not allow even a conscience clause. Surely, the State Parliament is not expected to act so tyrannically as to pass a law compelling the whole population of New South Wales to be vaccinated, seeing that there is a strong objection to compulsory vaccination in the State. Many persons have .died in New South Wales recently who would be alive to-day had they not been vaccinated. Some of the lymph that has been used has been of such a quality that many have suffered because of it. </para>

            <para>- Your ruling, sir, makes my position difficult. I do not think this Parliament desires that the embargo should be kept upon Sydney until the Parliament of New South Wales has passed a law compelling the citizens of the State to be vaccinated. Action of that kind is without precedent in any part of the civilized world. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> representing Lang, the Prime Minister, who represents Parramatta, and other Ministerial supporters who represent other Sydney constituencies, were sitting on this side of the House, the Government in power would have no peace, and no business would be done, until this unjustifiable embargo had been removed. The constituents of honorable members opposite are appealing to the honorable member for South Sydney and myself as the only legislators with the courage to stand up to represent the case of many people in the quarantine area who have been vaccinated in a brutal manner. </para>

I trustthat the Prime Minister is now in a better frame of mind than he was this morning, and that he will see that the 755,000 citizens in the quarantine area are no longer unduly punished. The Sydney Board of Health, the Sydney press, the Chamber of Commerce, and other public bodies are all in favour of the view I am expressing; and it is an absolute fact that if small-pox were to break out in New York, London, Glasgow, or Paris, such steps as have been, taken by this Government would be laughed at. </para>

During the last three or four years medical opinion has so altered that, while no one disputes the prophylactic power of vaccination, that method of treatment is now regarded as obsolete. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Victor</inline> Horsley, the  President  of the Compulsory Vaccination Society, said, so recently as April last, that, while he had not abandoned his belief in vaccination, he considered its compulsory application as obsolete and unnecessary, in view of the present methods of sanitation. In <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> we have a medical man who supplied lymph reported to be so unsterilized that it had caused hundreds of people to lose hundreds of days&#39; work; and I should like to know whether the Federal Government propose to reimburse those people. </para>

            <para>- It has occurred also, I believe, in Melbourne; but in Sydney the loss must amount to tens of thousands of pounds. The man who advised the Government was recommended by the Labour party for the position; but, of course, if they chose, when in power, to recommend an unfit man, the whole Parliament had to bear the responsibility. The Government are following the advice of a young man who does not seem to have sufficient knowledge to guide him as to the right steps to be taken. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion, that is what the Government ought to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> is so unaware of the recent developments in bacteriological science that last year, in Western Australia, he said that vaccination was unknown for a certain disease, although it had been used in this way in the Philippines for three years. If a medical man can make such mistakes, for which he has to be corrected by laymen, we cannot have much reverence for his knowledge. The attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston</inline> has advised Australia to take is different from the attitude of Italy, Germany, and England, where opinion is so changing, that during the last twelve months, in the Old Country, for instance, compulsory vaccination has been abolished in the Public Service. </para>

            <para>- I was quite  prepared to allow the Government time to see what the developments might be; and had the disease become malignant, I should have been ready to allow them to take any action they pleased to try to stamp it out. But we have had the history of epidemics of cow-pox in other countries, and, seeing that in this case there have been no deaths amongst the unvaccinated, although small-pox is believed to be specially fatal in such cases, we can only conclude that the Sydney epidemic is one of cow-pox. </para>

I should like the Government to take into consideration the fact that the Royal Commission in England recommended that the British Government should recompense all who had lost money because of vaccination; and I also desire that an inquiry shall be held into the number of deaths which undoubtedly have been caused by the lymph supplied. There is no question that a septic poison has been set up- </para>

          <para>- On a point of order earlier in the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you ruled so far as my memory serves me, that an honorable member would not be out of order in bringing before the House a matter of urgent public importance, notwithstanding that it related to a notice of motion, the debate on which stood adjourned. Is not the question which the honorable member for Werriwa is raising a matter of urgent public importance, and, therefore, within the ruling to which I refer? </para>

          <para>- The honorable member is mistaken as to a statement which I made earlier in the day, which had reference to quite another matter. What I pointed out was that the practice of the House of Commons was that questions without notice were asked only in respect of matters of urgent public importance. I did not rule that the discussion of a notice of motion, the debate on which had been adjourned, could be anticipated as an urgent matter of public importance. </para>

This is a question of increasing urgency, and your ruling, if I understand it rightly, means that, because the debate on the honorable member for Gwydir&#39;s motion has been ad-  journed to a future date, there can be no chance of raising this question on any other motion, no matter how urgent it may be. </para>

            <para>- We have already been told that Ministers are guided by the advice of their medical officers. It must be recollected that the members of the Labour party who were responsible for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston&#39;s</inline> appointment would, By voting for the motion which I desired to move, be passing a vote of censure upon their own nominee. Recognising that fact, I have always striven to make this matter one for the whole House to deal with. </para>

            <para>- Certainly. We have more than one report from medical men absolutely condemnatory of the policy which has been followed, and which has caused an untold amount of  Buffering.  It is time that this House took, into consideration the question of reimbursement  for  the loss which has been sustained. This is a matter which should receive consideration, and I think we might well accept the advice of other medical men who are more competent to deal with this smallpox outbreak than is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cumpston.</inline> These men have seen hundreds of cases of smallpox, whereas that young man had probably never seen one until he went to Sydney. The present restrictions seriously interfere with the livelihood of thousands. </para>
