            <para>- Has the Prime Minister seen, in the Ministerial organ - the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> - the names of those who, it is reported, are to be appointed to the Tariff Commission? I should like to know if the list is correct, because seven of the twelve are free-traders. I think that the Prime Minister shouldmake the numbers equal, so that there may be a straightforward investigation. </para>

          <para>- I wish to know from the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Treasurer, whether the arrangement come to with the British Government with respect to the coinage of silver includes the making of provision for the cost of replacing all worn gold coins minted in Australia. More of the gold which is minted in Australia is eventually exported than isused here. </para>

          <para>- I had intended to see my right honorable colleague this morning, and that was one of the subjects upon which I wished to obtain information. Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of other business, I was unable to see him. My impression is that the arrangement as to the replacing of worn gold coins does not refer to coinage minted in the past, but to coinage to be minted in the future. Such coinage, I believe, must be renewed after a very long interval - I think twenty years - though I am not in a position to make a precise statement on the subject, because the matter has been left entirely with the Treasurer. If my honorable friend will repeat his question on . Tuesday, I shall be prepared with full information. </para>

            <para>- That is a matter for the House. The Government do not wish to throw any obstacle in the way of the completion of the discussion. That will depend on the number of members who propose to take part in the debate. My impression is that it would take at least a month to thoroughly discuss the question, and if a majority of honorable members is prepared to remain here another month to do so, the Government are also prepared to remain, hut if honorable members will not stay, neither will the Government. </para>

            <para>- The trouble is to get reliable particulars in regard to the period before Federation. We have received a return from the Treasury, which has been checked by our Department, and has been sent to Queensland to ascertain if it is correct, because I am anxious that reliable information, which cannot be ques tioned by either the Treasury authorities here or the Queensland Government, shall be laid upon the table. </para>

            <para>-  The procedure seems to be somewhat strange. We have resolved that on certain days we shall transact certain business. I could understand, if the motion were to be dealt with merely as a formal one, letting it go with the consent of the House, but if this procedure is to be followed, then, no matter what business may have been set down on the noticepaper, an honorable member by giving a contingent notice of motion, may move that it be set aside. The sessional order provides that on Thursdays general business shall take precedence. </para>

          <para>- I could have understood the action of the Government if they had moved this motion on some other day, but I think that it is irregular to move it on a day on which private members&#39; business takes precedence. I do not, of course, contest your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> though I feel strongly on this matter. If the course now being followed is the correct one, there is nothing to prevent me, bymeans of a contingent notice of motion, from moving on a day set apart for Government business that general business take precedence, thus occupying a couple of hours. </para>

            <para>- At the same time, we are entitled to see that fairness is meted out to honorable members generally, and I protest against the favoritism now being shown to supporters of the Government. I do not say that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not an important measure; but it is not so viewed by the Prime Minister, and evidently he has some ulterior motive in affording time for its consideration. We know the right honorable gentleman&#39;s views, because he delivered a speech in strong opposition to the measure. </para>

He has expressed his willingness to afford time for the discussion of a proposal in which he does not believe. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. I do not think it will be fair to permit the honorable and learned member for Ballarat to make a speech on his motion, and to devote sufficient time to discussion to enable merely the Prime Minister, and perhaps the leader  of the Opposition to speak. There are other honorable members who have a right to be heard on the subject. </para>

            <para>- The views of all honorable members upon that important subject should go forth at the same time, and the discussion should be continued until the question is decided one way or the other. I wish it to be understood that I do not advocate that the House should discuss private members&#39; business. I have always held that the time so spent is practically wasted. I object, not so much to the wiping out of private members&#39; business, as to the unfair preference shown to supporters of the Government. It is proposed to devote a certain portion of the time which would otherwise be occupied in the discussion of public business, to debating matters which are in the hands of two private members. I maintain that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill should not be included amongst the Government&#39;s business. The Ministry have renounced all responsibility in connexion with that measure, and have placed it in the hands of a private member, and therefore it should take a position among the ordinary private business. Therefore, it seems to me that the Bill cannot be dealt with in Government time without the consent of the House. I give the Prime Minister credit for having adopted the right course in having handed the Bill over to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, but it was the duty of that honorable member to move that it should be made an order of the day for such and such a day, instead of its being merely included amongst the Government business. I shall not, however, discuss that matter any further, because I shall have an opportunity to deal with it to-morrow. I trust that in fairness to honorable members who have private business on the notice-paper, the Government proposal will be rejected. </para>

          <para>- I think the action of the Prime Minister is scarcely warranted at this stage, especially in view of the importance of the business which is on the notice-paper for consideration today. The second notice of motion deals with a matter which I regard as of the utmost importance, namely, the introduction of Chinese into South Africa. </para>

            <para>- I was about to refer to that. It appears to me that in connexion with that notice of motion we may find a reason for the proposal that is now before us. The question therein dealt with is a very ticklish one for some honorable members. The motion has been postponed two or three times, apparently because the Prime Minister does not care to discuss it. I am not, however, afraid to face it. </para>

            <para>- I desire to emphasize the point raised by the honorable member for Kennedy to the effect that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not a Government measure. It is distinctly a private measure. The Prime Minister desires to postpone private members&#39; business to-day, and yet to-morrow he proposes to afford the honorable member for EdenMonaro an opportunity of proceeding with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. He has also intimated that Tuesday next will be devoted to a discussion of the question of Preferential Trade, which will be initiated upon a motion by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I should like to know what chance the Manufactures &#34;Encouragement Bill has of receiving fair consideration if it is to be finally dealt with to-morrow? It has absolutely no chance whatever. We all recognise that even if the debate upon it in Committee is very limited, its consideration must occupy at least two or three days. The leader of the Government himself admits that the discussion of the question, of Preferential Trade - if it is to be pushed to a division - would absorb quite a month. What is the meaning of all these statements ? Obviously, they mean that neither of the subjects to which I have referred will be finally disposed of. The action of the right honorable gentleman is prompted by a desire to delay the consideration of certain business which appears upon the notice-paper. He has no intention whatever of finally dealing before the prorogation of Parliament with either of the two important matters mentioned. </para>

          <para>- When the Prime Minister gave notice of this motion last evening I assumed that his intention was to devote to the consideration of Government business, the time which is usually allotted to private members, and in view of the general desire to get into recess, I felt disposed to support him. It now appears, however, that he proposes to&#39; rob private members generally of the few hours in the remainder of the session, which could be devoted to a consideration of their business, and, at the same time,/to set &#39;apart two days to enable two Government supporters to bring forward matters in which they are specially interested. It seems to me that such a proposal cannot be in any way justified. Why should certain honorable members be afforded privileges which are denied to others? Had the Prime Minister proposed to take the time which is ordinarily allotted to private members&#39; business, and devote it to the transaction of Government! business, I should have raised no objection. What a farce it is to talk about setting tomorrow apart for the consideration of tha Manufactures Encouragement Bill, with a view to finally passing that measure ! The Prime Minister knows very well that there is no prospect whatever of its being finally dealt with to-morrow. </para>

          <para>- I desire to add some sort of protest to what has already been said against the intention of the Government to curtail the opportunity of discussing the two very important subjects which have been referred to by the honorable member for Hume, namely, Preferential Trade and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. It is essential to the good government of this country that every honorable member should have a chance of voicing his opinion upon Preferential Trade now, rather than wait until after Parliament re-assembles next year. By that time the Prime Minister will have had an opportunity to ascertain how the cat jumps, and will thus be in a position to come in on the top of the tide. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman proposes to give the honorable and learned member for Ballarat an opportunity of discussing Preferential Trade, so as to placate him whilst denying a similar privilege to others. He makes a noncommittal sort of reply - we all recognise that he is a past master in that art - and then desires to sink into a glorious recess, at the end of which period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamber-</inline> lain may have clone something, or possibly the elections may have taken place in Great Britain. At any rate, he would then be in a position, irrespective of what party prevailed at the polls, to give effect to popular demands.

            <para>- That I am out of order is a most regrettable fact. The whole proposal of the Government is a sham, seeing that they intend to give up the whole of to-morrow to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro - avowedly for the purpose of enabling the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to be finally dealt with. There are other important matters upon the business-paper upon which we should arrive at a decision - notably, a motion having reference to the introduction of Chinese labour in South Africa. </para>

            <para>- I understood the Prime Minister to say that if honorable members would give up the time that would in ordinary circumstances be devoted this afternoon to private members&#39; business, he would adopt a certain course. The private members&#39; business set down for consideration today is not of&#39; a very important character ; but that, of course, is a matter of opinion. The Prime Minister pointed out that it would be more desirable to proceed with the consideration of business such as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which might be productive of some good result, than to discuss mere abstract questions. I admit that that is open to argument, but I regret <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> find that there are honorable members in this House who disagree with my contention that- it is better that we should attempt to pass measures, from which we can obtain some tangible result, than to devote time to the discussion of abstract questions. At the close of a session., there is, as a rule, a certain degree of consideration extended to a Government. Honorable members usually defer the consideration of mere abstract motions until proposals likely to produce some result have been dealt with. In making the statement as to the time to be given to private members&#39; business, I do not think that the Prime Minister intended <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> suggest that he would merely set apart to-morrow for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. </para>

            <para>- I thought the Prime Minister expressed the hope that honorable members would see that as we were apparently approaching the close of the session, it was desirable to forego the consideration of notices of motion set down for to-day, none of which could lead to any very important result. He said that if we adopted that course we should be able to conclude the consideration of the Conciliation and &#34;Arbitration Bill this evening, and that to-morrow we should be able to deal with the question of Preferential Trade or the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. I have no desire to discuss Preferential Trade further than to say that I am a supporter of it ; but there can be no question that we can pass the Manufactures Encouragement Bill this session if - honorable members really desire to see it carried into law. </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable member must occasionally suffer from deafness. We have been told that it is all very well to allow the Government to go into recess and come in with the rising tide next session. But so far as the people are concerned, it is immaterial who is on the top of the tide. Is not the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill of more consequence than is any question as to the leadership of the House? </para>

            <para>- One is apt to be led away by interjections suggested by others, who would show to better advantage if they were prepared to make them themselves. It is interesting to observe certain honorable members making bullets, and getting others to fire them. Whenever I attempt to answer any statements in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, half-a-dozen honorable members, from the leader of the Opposition downwards, are always ready to cry out about the unfair treatment of the honorable member for Hume. </para>

            <para>- If you were in my position, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> you would find it very difficult to refrain from answering interjections which in themselves are very pertinent. I hope I do not misunderstand the Prime Minister. I take it that he considers we should have reasonable time to discuss the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. We know, of course, that if honorable members are determined to block the passing of that Bill merely because a private member happens to have charge of it, and tha? the right honorable member for East Sydney is the leader of the Government, -they can do so. If that is the spirit which animates them, it is certainly desirable that we should have a dissolution rather than a prorogation. Those who, like me, are earnestly in favour of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, will appeal to the Prime Minister not to withdraw his motion. </para>

I should not have objected to the withdrawal of the motion had I not been attacked by the Opposition. No honorable member may attack me with impunity. I am quite prepared to answer in this House and out of it for any action I have taken. There is no reason why the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should be delayed. If we postponed private members &#39; business set down for consideration to-day, we should have an opportunity to deal with that measure as -well as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Honorable members have publicly pledged themselves to abide by the decision of the House on the subject of bonuses, and therefore, they should take the opinion of the majority as soon as possible, in order that we may know what is to be done, and not continue to gull the people by pretending to do what we do not intend to do. </para>

After the shameful tactics which have been resorted to on two occasions when I have attempted to bring that motion forward, I cannot but protest in the strongest terms which our rules allow against such contemptible and miserable tactics as are now being pursued. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that my limited vocabulary cannot find more apt terms. The tactics of the Government are certainly not dignified. I hope that private members will insist upon exercising their privileges, and will not allow their business to be pushed on one side without Thyme or reason. The Prime Minister has suddenly developed great zeal in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. He is anxious to go on with the measure now, because we have told him that it is not worth having, and that, therefore, we do not care what becomes of it. I assure the House that my motion must be faced sooner or later, and the Government may just as well face it gracefully as make a wry face over it. This unprofitable and unfruitful session should be brought to a termination as soon as possible. Either by prorogation or by dissolution, we should immediately put an end for the timebeing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> this expensive and unseemly <inline font-style="italic">farce</inline> of doing business in which we have no serious interest. What care the Government for the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ? Their new born zeal for passing it is shown only when the Bill has been emasculated, and is no longer worth the paper on which it is printed. </para>

            <para>- It is usual at this period of the session for private members to give up their time, so that public business may be proceeded with. Honorable members who place motions of a controversial character on the notice-paper know that they are not likely to reach finality. In my opinion there is a clear distinction between the ordinary private members&#39; business on the notice-paper, and the two proposals which have been referred to, and are in charge of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat and the honorable member for Eden-Monaro respectively. Those two matters are legacies from a past session, and the Government - whether wisely or unwisely, it is not for me to say at the present time - have seen fit to give up their own time for their consideration, regarding them as of an important character, and questions in regard to which an attempt should be made to reach finality. For my own part, however, when the Government refused to take up the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and left it to a private member, I felt that there was no hope of getting &#34;it passed. Those of us who are enthusiastic supporters of the Bill are aware that no private member has a chance to obtain finality in regard to such a measure. </para>

            <para>-I think there is justification for giving special consideration to these two proposals. So far as the question of preferential trade is concerned, if honorable members choose to discuss it at length, it will be impossible to come to any decision this session. To my mind, the position shows that there is a great amount of make-believe in public as well as in private life. We are gulling the public all the time. </para>

It seems extraordinary that a Parliament constituted of over 100 allegedly sane business men, should transact the business of the country in a way which would bring them to insolvency in no time if applied to their private affairs.

            <para>- In view of the attitude adopted by the Prime Minister, after the expressions of disapproval from this side of the House, I do not desire to occupy any further time in discussing this matter. If there were any need for me to express my opinion with regard to the proposal to set aside private business, I should have a good deal more to say. I desire that private members&#39; business, and particularly the motion relating to the tobacco monopoly, should be proceeded with. </para>

          <para>-I commend the Prime Minister for offering to withdraw the motion. Every one knows that it is usual, long prior to the close of the session, to bring such a motion forward. It has been the invariable rule, both in the States Parliaments and in this House, for honorable members, towards the close of the session, to sacrifice the private business standing in their names, and what was proposed to-day, therefore, was only in accordance with a long line of precedents reaching as far back as our knowledge of Parliamentary procedure. It seems, however, that honorable members opposite are quite determined not to extend ordinary courtesy to the present Government. </para>

            <para>- It is very unfortunate that honorable members should have outraged the usual amenities by refusing to accede to a motion such as that now before us. A motion of this kind was adopted two or three months prior to the close of the last session, and in the ordinary course the Government take similar action at least a month or five weeks before the date at which it is anticipated the session will be brought to an end. </para>

            <para>- Honorable members do not like to be squared up, and to be reminded of the logical outcome of their actions. The honorable member has accused me of unfairness, and yet he indicated by interjection a score of times this afternoon, without any interruption from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that the whole ground of complaint is that all private members are not being treated upon the same footing. He is complaining that the Government are proposing to make an exception in favour of Preferential Trade. </para>

            <para>- Certainly ; I shall be glad to do so, and I beg of you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to stop these interjections. We have been sitting for nearly ten months, and 1 think that the honorable member for Moira rightly complains of the great length of our sessions. Something will have to be done with a strong hand to shorten the duration of our sessions. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie told the honorable member for Moira that &#39;he could leave Parliament if he did not care to attend our long sittings. I would suggest that there is another alternative, namely, that honorable members may remain in parliamentary life and still be able to give some time to their private business. I think that one of the most urgent reforms we require is the curtailment of the length of our sessions. If a strong determination were shown in this direction, we should do better work, and more of it. But honorable members opposite are not prepared  to do what is customary towards the close of the session. They refuse to give the Government the sole control of the time of the House. So far as I am aware, that courtesy has never previously been refused to any Government by any  Parliament  in the Commonwealth. I admit that the members of the Opposition subscribe to none of the ordinary customs of parliamentary government. They are establishing precedents of a most objectionable character, and I appeal to them to allow the Government to . devote the time which still remains to us during the current session to the consideration of important public business. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that, and I merely desired to make incidental reference to the honorable member for Parramatta. He has taken a strictly partisan view of this question. If the Government honestly desired to devote this afternoon to the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, I should raise no objection to their action. As a matter of fact, however, the course which they propose to adopt is prompted only by a -wish to placate one or two of their supporters by enabling them to discuss subjects in which they are interested, notwithstanding that those discussions must be barren of results, so far as the present session is concerned. I venture to say that no precedent can be found for handing over to the control of a private member such a measure as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. The honorable member for Parramatta knows perfectly well that to exhaustively discuss the question of Preferential Trade would occupy a very considerable time. I recognise that the period which is ordinarily allotted to private members on Thursday afternoon has almost passed. That fact may be attributed to the speech delivered by the honorable member for Moira, who is always anxious to dictate to the Opposition. In his remarks this afternoon that honorable member again hinted - just as did the honorable member for Parramatta - that the Prime Minister will have to exhibit more backbone in the conduct of public business. I wish to remind those honorable members of the fact that the members of the Opposition possess some rights. We are expected to discharge the duties which attach to a responsible Opposition. The attitude we have adopted this afternoon is not prompted by a desire to delay the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, but by a wish to see equality of treatment extended to every honorable member. Even if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill were finally dealt with to-morrow, it could not be put into operation unless the Government were prepared to guarantee that the money  necessary  for that purpose will be forthcoming. They are not willing to father the measure. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>We, Your Majesty&#39;s dutiful and loyal subjects, the members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on  behalf  of the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty&#39;s person and Government. </para>
          <para>We have observed, with feelings of profound satisfaction, the evidence afforded by the recent speeches from the Throne, and debates thereon in the House of Lords and Commons of the United Kingdom, and also from Your Most Gracious Majesty&#39;s recent visits to Ireland, of a sincere desire on all sides to usher in a new era of lasting peace -and goodwill in Ireland, and this House congratulates the mother country on the just and equitable legislation recently passed on the land and education questions, and hopes for an early and lasting settlement of the troublesome problem of the government of Ireland, which has taxed the powers of British statesmen for so long. </para>
          <para>Enjoying and appreciating, as we do, the blessings of self-government here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule will be granted to the people of Ireland. We would point out that land purchase was half of the proposed settlement of Ireland&#39;s difficulties in 1881, and that recently Your Majesty&#39;s advisers saw fit to pass a liberal measure of land purchase, thus removing the great hindrance to Home Rule. </para>
          <para>We desire to point to our own experience, and to emphasize the blessings which accrue to this Commonwealth from the Federal system of Home Rule, under which our people live, and the benefits in which the people of&#34; Australia, with their fellow citizens and subjects of the Dominion of Canada, rejoice. This extended experience which Your Most Gracious Majesty&#39;s subjects have had of the inestimable benefits resulting from selfgovernment being bestowed on the Australian States and Commonwealth, only intensifies their desire to affirm through their representatives in Parliament the sentiment that nothing could give more solidarity to the Empire over which Your Most Gracious Majesty rules than a liberal measure of Federal Home Rule being granted to the people of Ireland. </para>
          <para>It is scarcely fair to expect me to deal with this subject in the brief period at my disposal, and consequently I think that the House might grant me its indulgence by allowing me to continue my remarks upon a future occasion. </para>

            <para>- The nominative of this motion - the object of it- is  His  Most Gracious Majesty the King. I do not wish to approach so exalted a ruler in any way as a matter of form, but rather from genuine and sincere feeling, which will be shared by those who are most interested in this question, namely, the Irish people. That they entertain a profound respect and reverence for  His  Majesty the King has been demonstrated again and again. Upon the other hand,  His  Majesty has shown, his high appreciation of the Irish character. I may be told that it is not desirable that we should discuss Imperial politics, because our action may provoke interference by the Imperial authorities with Australian politics. </para>

            <para>- That will be the objection raised to a proposal to approach the Imperial Parliament, even through the person of His Majesty. But I would point out that a precedent has already been established in that connexion. Australia wascalled upon to interfere in a matter of Imperial concern in connexion with the recent South African Avar. Upon that occasion we did our best to assist the British Government. I attribute to these who were enthusiastically in favour of that war only the very best intentions. Surely, if a dependency of Great Britain may interfere with Imperial politics, to make war, to spread desolation and carnage in any part of His Majesty&#39;s dominions, it is our inalienable right to interfere, with a view of making peace, and1 spreading good-will and happiness throughout the land. That is the object I have in view in submitting this motion. Australians will certainly throw more enthusiasm into a proposal of this kind than they could be expected to display in supporting any pro-, position to make war. This is a message of peace ; it is a proposal to make a reality of a union which exists only onpaper. It is a proposal to bring about a union of hearts, and that being so, I feel that if we have ever shown any enthusiasm for the welfare of the Empire in relation  to a matter of war and destruction, this motion will find a far more ready response in the hearts of the people of Australia. It makes for righteousness, peace, and goodwill in His Majesty&#39;s dominions. </para>

            <para>- I was about to say that in this case the minority is something like one in twenty-eight. The only province of Ireland in which there is any opposition to Home Rule, is that of Ulster. But, even in Protestant Ulster, something like 80 or 90 per cent, of the people believe in the principle. The fact that the vast majority of members returned by that socalled anti-Irish province are in favour of Home Rule, proves that its population must consist of a very large percentage of persons who are in favour of the principle. In the southern parts of Ireland the people are unanimously in favour of it, so that the minority is a miserable _ one, utterly unworthy of consideration. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member is a very &#39;fair representative of the class for which he speaks. This opposition reminds me of one of those little insects that make a noise by the river side, while the big stream flows steadily on. Ever since I have known anything about politics, the people of Ireland have spoken with one voice, and with great fervour, in favour of Home Rule. There can be no mistake as to its being a thoroughly democratic proposal. If the people of Scotland/ had asked for Home Rule with the same unanimity as have the people of Ireland, their prayer would have been granted long ago. Coming more closely to the terms of my motion, I would remind the House that the demand for Home Rule is now being received with a better spirit by the people of England. That better feeling has been largely due to the action of  His  Majesty the King, who, within the last two years, paid a most successful visit to Ireland. This was the first Royal visit almost since the time of George IV., and it seems to me that it ushered in a new- era, in which a better feeling is likely to arise between the people of Ireland and the rest of the Empire.  His  Majesty&#39;s visit has demonstrated beyond doubt that the people of Ireland are at heart most loyal and enthusiastic. The suspicion caused by class and party feeling in the old country has alone been responsible for anything in the shape of doubt as to the loyalty of Ireland. Loyalty is often a term applied to a kind of affection for the reigning monarch, but in its truer sense it has to do with devotion to law. In that respect I claim that there is no reproach upon the people of Ireland. A nation has a right to protest against bad laws, and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> resort to constitutional means of righting them, and I contend that the loyalty of Ireland is loyalty in the best and highest sense. Loyalty is&#39; shown to the King as the head and embodiment of the law. But the devotion of the people of Ireland to the law itself, in the abstract, has never been doubted. If we turn to the records of crime, we find that the Irish are perhaps the most law-abiding people in the world. There is no other country where serious crimes are less prevalent, and even in the matter of political crimes, which in many cases have been manufactured, Ireland bears favorable comparison with Australia, which has a very good record. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> pointed out in his great Home Rule speech, from 1832 to the passing of the Reform Bill there was no Crimes Act in force, with the result that there was no crime. After that, however, Crimes Acts were continuously in operation. There was special legislation for the suppression of crime, and, in consequence, it increased. We have to face the great historical fact that coercion by special legislation invariably produces crime, whereas ordinary laws either suppress or keep it under control. That has been the history of Ireland. Coercion Bills have bred crime. I belong to a people who are perhaps the most law-abiding in the world. They are reputed to keep the Sabbath Day, and everything else on which they can lay their hands, but as the result of special legislation passed in connexion with the Crofters - legislation&#39; similar to that applied to Ireland - crime became rampant among  the people of the Highlands, who are regarded as a God-fearing class. Coercion and suppression - the suspension of the ordinary law - have been responsible for the charge of disloyalty made against the people of Ireland. Many of the crimes committed there have been the result of bad legislation. </para>

            <para>- That is so. But, coming back to the nominative of the proposed address, namely, our respect for the Throne, I would point out that this is a proposal that we should avail ourselves of the privilege of the humblest citizen in the realm to approach so high and exalted a personage as  His  Majesty the King. We wish to take advantage of that right, as well as of the fact that  His  Majesty has more than once shown that he can appreciate the loyalty that has been demonstrated by the Irish in fighting, the battles of the Empire. That, according to my honorable friends opposite, is the true test of loyalty. I should not have touched on this matter but for the fact that it has been dragged in with very bad taste, and I feel that I am bound to answer the statement that has been made. A Commission, which sat after the Crimean war, reported that 47 per cent, of the troops which took part in that war were Irish, while 57 per cent, of the officers were also of Irish birth. We all know that the vast majority of British troops which took part in the South African war were Irish, and that the majority of the generals also claimed Ireland as their place of birth. If any section of the people of the Empire have fully demonstrated their loyalty and their readiness to share the burdens of the Empire by fighting its battles the Irish have done so. Unfortunately, they have not served under a very thankful master. All that they have received in return has been prolonged contumely and contempt. </para>

              <para>- The case was one in which two honorable members, acting on behalf of all the members of this House, took upon themselves the responsibility of appealing against the judgment of the Victorian Court. In stating the decision of the High Court, the Chief Justice of Australia said, amongst other things - </para>

            <para>According to the Constitution, the salary of the Governor-General might not be altered, and if the Federal Parliament attempted to impose an income tax of 2s. on it, the effective salary would be reduced by 10 per cent., whether deducted first or collected afterwards. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a self-evident fact. If the Constitution is at fault, I do not think either the High Court or this Parliament should be blamed. The fact remains that if income tax is levied upon salaries fixed by the Constitution, they are reduced by the amount of the tax, and consequently there is an invasion of the Constitution whenever such a tax is levied. The Court thought that the tax under consideration - was in substance, if valid, both a tax on the income of the appellants and a diminution of that income. The next question was whether such an imposition or diminution made by the authority of the State would, if valid, fetter, control, or interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para class="block">The Court held that that question seemed to supply its own answer. That answer is very obvious. If the States have the power to tax Federal officers, they have the power to seriously interfere with the agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth. We know that the States would not so interfere intentionally, but their desire is that all Federal officers shall - as in equity we all admit they should - be subject to the same taxation as the rest of the community. The point is, however, that a State might at any time, by levying a special <inline font-style="italic">*h\ on</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Federal agencies, resist the Federal authority within its borders. That was one of the reasons of the High Court for upholding the appeal. As the Chief Justice further pointed out - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the case of the Commonwealth, the argument for the destruction of uniformity of compensation had especial force, when it was remembered that the income taxes in the several States were unequal in their incidence. In order, therefore, to give effect to the provisions of the Federal laws regulating the salaries of officers, it would be necessary to make special provisions for adjusting their incomes when transferred. State taxation of Federal salaries was open to two objections - (1) In effect, it diminished the recompense allotted by the Commonwealth to its officers, and so interfered with its agencies ; and (2) it interfered with the freedom of action of the Commonwealth in the transfer of its officers from State to State, except at the risk of doing them an injustice, only to be remedied by the appropriation of Federal revenue for the purpose. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The second point made by the Court is that, owing to the fact that the income taxation levied by the States is not uniform, the freedom of the Commonwealth to transfer its servants from one State to another is very seriously interfered with. If the Constitution is at fault in&#34; that regard, we can hardly blame the High Court for interpreting it, or ourselves for acting under it. </para>

              <para>- I have quoted the three points on which the High Court laid great stress, and in regard to which laymen can form an opinion with as much facility as the legal gentleman who framed the judgment. To recapitulate these points very  briefly,  they are as follow: - First, a tax imposed by a State on a Commonwealth officer might in an extreme case be made to interfere very seriously with an instrumental itv of the Commonwealth, by compelling it to&#34; pay additional salary to the officer so  concerned ; secondly, the unevenness of the income taxation of the various States would restrict the Commonwealth power to send its officers into any State that it might desire; thirdly, the State has power of  taxation only over persons who come within its borders with its own consent and authority. Federal members come to Victoria, not with the permission and authority of this State, but bv the order and desire of a paramount power, the Commonwealth of Australia. Consequently, unless the States have been given by the Constitution a new power to tax Federal servants, they have no legal right to exact income tax from them. In stating these three points, I am discussing solely the legal aspects of this most important question. I have, so far, dealt with the legal aspect of the question. I now propose to address myself as briefly as the importance of the subject will permit to the equity side - to the great question whether there shall be established in the Commonwealth a privileged class, which, under the protection of the technicalities of the law, shall be able to evade payment of taxation similar to that which their fellow-citizens have to bear. Federal servants, although they may be sent into a State by the authority of the paramount power, yet enjoy all the protection and safeguards which the State offers to its ordinary citizens. Therefore, it is obvious that from the point of view of equity, the Commonwealth servants should contribute towards the cost incurred in affording the security which they enjoy equally with their less happily-situated State confreres. I have indicated .the dangers attached to the States being permitted to tax Federal officers, and although they are not particularly imminent, a Stale might, in an extreme case, seek to harass the Commonwealth authority within the State area. I think honorable members will agree that we should endeavour to avoid any possibility of that happening. We seem to be debarred, not only by the law, but by considerations of ordinary prudence, from running any such risk. At the same time, we must endeavour to exercise our authority in the direction of equalizing conditions, and removing the injustice which will be involved by the continuance of the present state of affairs. The motion proposes that a short Bill shall be introduced for the purpose of imposing a Federal Income Tax, which shall apply to all persons in the Commonwealth Public Service, who, by the decision of the High Court, escape payment of a State Income Tax. The proposal is that we should ourselves tax our own servants. We have already heard the arguments urged in favour of that proposal. I now desire to discuss the objections to it. I think the greatest objection rests upon the fact that the direct taxation of Federal servants may be used in. the future, and inevitably will be used, as the thin end of the wedge of universal direct taxation by the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I shall show the honorable member why I think that direct taxation by the Commonwealth - not by the States- is bad. . If the Commonwealth were to impose direct taxation it would have to avail itself of one of the means of . raising revenue of which the States have at present the exclusive use. That would involve a duplication of authority in one of the avenues of taxation. We all know that when the Commonwealth came into being the States agreed to give up their principal means of raising revenue, namely, Customs duties. We know also that they have retained,  among  other things, an unlimited right to levy direct taxation upon their own citizens. If we established a dual system of income taxation, we should depreciate the value to the State of that means of taxation, &#39;and thereby seriously interfere) with its opportunities for raising revenue. Honorable members know - even those who believe in the single tax - that there is a limit to the amount that can be extracted from the public by means of a tax. As the matter stands at present, the States have absolute power to impose taxation to the uttermost. If we exercise our authority in the same direction, we shall limit the opportunities of the States, and consequently interfere with the agencies and the powers of the States. As one who has always desired to safeguard and protect the powers of the States, I find myself in an extremely difficult position. How could we answer to the States for the injustice that would be done to them if we imposed a tax which would prove to be the forerunner of an attempt to interfere with their present powers of taxation? </para>

              <para>- That would be introducing the thick end of the wedge. I am endeavouring to point out that if an Income Tax were imposed by the Commonwealth without any restriction, either by constitutional process or otherwise, the rights of the States would be exposed to great danger. Any risk upon that score, would, however, disappear if we decided that the income tax imposed by us should for all time, be levied only upon Federal officers. If that safeguard were provided1, I should welcome a proposal such as that now before us. The Federal servants are divided into three classes. In the first place, there are the departmental officers, who are resident in their own States; secondly-, the departmental headquarters;&#39; officers resident in Melbourne; and, thirdly, the members and officers of the Commonwealth Parliament. Speaking purely from the point of view of equity, I do not see why departmental officers residing in their own States should not pay income tax to those States for the security which they enjoy in common with their fellow-citizens. The departmental headquarters&#39; officers, who are resident in Melbourne, are, in one particular,- in much the same position as the officers of this Parliament. They are here as guests of Victoria, pending the establishment of the Federal Capital. In. the meanwhile these officers should not escape from the payment of their share of taxation, but the question is, &#34;To whom shall they pay it?&#34; The salaries of these officials are not being paid solely by the citizens of Victoria. They are here as guests, and if an attempt were made by Victoria to extract taxation from these officials for State purposes,, and not for those of the Commonwealth at  large, she would be taking up very much the same position as a person who invited another to stay with him, and who when the last train had gone, and no other accommodation could be obtained, endeavoured to extract payment for the hospitality he had extended. In conclusion, I should like to say that honorable members can, without passing a Bill, overcome the difficulty by rushing the Treasury with offers of their conscience money. We may all do that, and thereby save a good deal of trouble, and that is the course which I hope most honorable members will follow. I am content to believe that those honorable members who may oppose this motion are prompted to do so solely upon national grounds.- I realize that people outside this House will be apt to&#39; attribute all sorts of base motives to us when we arrive at an inevitable conclusion upon this motion, whether it be this afternoon or next session. But, irrespective of what view may be taken by the House, even if its decision is Opposed to my own view - and I hope; I have made it quite clear - that I am entirely in favour of the proposal under consideration. If, however, others oppose the motion, I shall credit them also with being actuated only &#39;by a desire to act in the very best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- From the first, the question which is now before us has been complicated by the action which was taken in this State when an attempt was made to collect income tax from Federal representatives resident in other States, who merely visited Victoria for the purpose of discharging their legislative duties. A number of honorable members felt that any tax of that character which might be payable by them was legitimately due to the State to which they belong. Privately I made strong representations to the Victorian Government - I regret to say without avail - that any levy should be limited to the Federal representatives of Victoria. It was that incident which first provoked the feeling antagonistic to this tax. In the next place the attempt to collect taxation upon the salaries of Victorian representatives in itself raised a constitutional question, and when the attempt extended to salaries payable to the whole of -the representatives of the Commonwealth, it raised a veryserious question, of which, so far, no adequate appreciation has been evidenced in the columns of the press. So far as I am aware, it has not been observed that the very principle at stake in the endeavour to levy income tax upon the salaries payable to Federal officers is identical with that involved in the effort made in this Parliament to control the public servants of the States. It is the same principle inverted. I am aware .hat there are honorable members who maintain that the express language of the Constitution separates the case of the public servants of the States from any general principle. But, putting that technical contention upon one side, every one will admit that the Federal principle, that the spheres of action of the Commonwealth and the States should be preserved distinct - as was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall - the principle which forbade the Commonwealth to tax the servants of the Slates equally forbade the States to tax the servants of the Commonwealth. Consequently, we find thai critics outside, who were violently in favour of that principle when the question of interference with the public servants of ths States was involved, denounce it most severely when it is applied to Federal servants. When the question at issue&#39; was whether the Federation could impose any burden upon the States, they were strong in their determination to stand by the Constitution, but when the question involved is whether the States can impose burdens upon Commonwealth officers, they adopt an opposite attitude. I maintain that if they accept the one application of the principle they must accept the other. Under the feeling which was generated in consequence of the attempt to tax representatives outside of Victoria, it was thought necessary that two members of this Parliament, on behalf of all the public servants of the- Commonwealth - whether in the Legislature or elsewhere, for we are all public servants - should be selected as defendants in order that test cases might be submitted to the Court. As I was Attorney-General at the time, I could not refuse to allow myself to be nominated as one of the defendants, although, as a matter of fact, I have always, under protest, paid income tax to Victoria. As AttorneyGeneral at the time, I was perfectly willing to become a nominal defendant in these cases, brought in reality against all persons who received salaries from the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Hume, who was a member of the same Administration, also kindly consented to allow his name to be used to represent those public servants who do not live in Victoria, but who transact a part of their business - legislative or otherwise - within its bounds. As I have said, I paid income tax in this State under protest. </para>

              <para>- The cases werecon sidered by the Victorian Supreme Court, and finally, upon appeal, by the High Court, which gave a most important decision in the matter. Of this we have up to the present time had an opportunity of reading only a fraction, which appeared in the public press. If I may be permitted to say so, that fraction appears to be based upon the soundest principles of Federal law, which it will be absolutely necessary for this Parliament to maintain at any cost. It is the all-sufficient principle that, in just the same way as we refrain from any interference with the States or with their public servants, so as not to impair the efficient discharge of their public duties, we demand that our independence shall be likewise preserved, and that our public servants and agencies shall be equally free from interference by the States. </para>

              <para>- When that Bill comes before the High Court, I am convinced - in view of its recent judgment - that it will declare that provision unconstitutional. The same principle which has protected the public servants of the Commonwealth from interference by the States, will guard their public servants against interference from us. It has been represented in the press that this is a question full of highly intricate, refined, and hairsplitting distinctions, which only lawyers can discover. Instead of that, it is the plainest common-sense principle, to which any two legislative bodies dealing with the same people must resort. We each have a duty to perform to the electors of Australia. In our Constitution we have distinctly specified the work which we are called upon to perform. Legislation in regard to everything else remains with the States Legislatures, and is thus placed beyond our power. It would be absolutely impossible for the States to carry out the behests of the electors, if we, sitting here and representing those electors, and also a great many more, were to trench upon their functions. So in order that the Federation may do its work we must protect our own Government, and our own public servants against encroachments by the States. Without those mutual abstinences Federal government is impossible, and the Constitution is not worth the paper upon which it is written. Without them, no Federal spirit can be created, and no permanent work can be done. We deal with the fundamental basis of Federation when we say that the agencies of the Commonwealth Government, its Members of Parliament, and its public servants as such, must stand outside the control of the States. If the States have power to impose taxation upon Federal servants, what is there to prevent them from increasing that taxation, until it becomes absolutely destructive of the income which they receive? There would be nothing to prevent them from destroying all the functions of government which we are called upon to exercise. Similarly, we might destroy their authority. Consequently, I hold that, just as the Federation must keep within its own domain - which is large enough, in all conscience - the States must be kept within their own domain. Under these circumstances, it appears to me that the judgment of the High Coutt is absolutely sound. It constitutes a declaration of Federal independence, and of the right of our public officers to act without interference by any State. We have put ourselves and them in a proper position to enable us to discharge our duties to the people of this country. </para>

          <para class="block">Federal public servants as such, and Federal public servants as citizens. If this Parliament should ever impose an income tax, it will have no right to levy upon the salaries paid to the public servants of the States, because we shall not be able to impair their ability to discharge their obligations to their employers. But having defended our just rights, we are brought face to face with another question, &#39;which is a very plain, simple, and practical one. Having established the fact that the. Commonwealth public officers are legally and necesarily exempt from interference by the States, what are our moral obligations ? I submit that, so far as they are concerned, there can be no question that this Parliament would be doing itself justice and honour if it required that each Commonwealth public officer should recognise the obligation upon him to stand shoulder to shoulder with his fellowcitizens in bearing the taxation imposed by the State in which he resides. If we provide for that by Federal law, as I think we have power to do, we shall have at once removed all cause of complaint. We shall have put ourselves beyond attack, and at the same time have done all that justice demands. I admit that, it is not as easy as it may seem at first sight to devise a legislative scheme by which this can be effected. I have privately called the attention of the Ministry to the matter from time to time, and have made several suggestions, one of which, I think, should suffice to carry out our purpose, at all events during the ten ye.us&#39; period. We have merely to provide that the Commonwealth Government shall have the right to retain from the sum payable  to any member of the Federal Public Service, or member of Parliament, the amount which would be levied under the income tax of the State in which he resides. </para>

If the Federal Government took power to retain from the incomes payable to Members of Parliament and public servants of the Commonwealth, the sum which would be payable in respect of each income tax, the result would be that - while the present system prevails which allows the surplus remaining after the deduction of the Federal expenditure to flow back to the States - the amount so retained would go into the coffers of the State in which it was deducted, without any further action on our part. It might be necessary to pass an Order in Council clearly defining the State Acts recognised, and making the deductions perfectly definite. By an order of the Governor-General in Council, the Government would be able to retain from each member of the Parliament and each Federal public servant living in a State where an income tax was in operation the amount of the tax, and the money so retained would flow back to the State as part of the surplus, without any further act on our part. </para>

              <para>- The distribution would not be made on a more differing basis than that upon which the surplus is at present returned. If we expend more on work and buildings in one State than  another, a deduction is made from the amount which would be otherwise returned to the first. I do not put this forward as a scheme which has been perfected. It has not been my duty to look into the matter with professional thoroughness, and I am now merelyspeaking as a lay member of the House might do. </para>

              <para>- I shall not discuss that point with the honorable member; but I may say that in one sense he is right and in another he is wrong. The right honorable member for Swan is just as much entitled to bear any Federal expenditure as is the honorable member for Maranoa. But we have to remember that this, does not relate to Federal expenditure. The honorable member for Maranoa would have to pay something because his State chooses to levy upon him as one of its citizens. </para>

              <para>- I may be wrong, but I think not. If the course which I propose will not serve the purpose, there are other means of giving effect to our desire. I wish to emphasize the point that the Prime Minister should make an effort to find some way to overcome the difficulty before we go into recess. The sum involved, is trifling to the individual, but the principle at stake is important. The principle is that we,  as citizens of the States, should shoulder the responsibilities which our fellowcitizens are called upon to bear ; and as long as the collection which I suggest does not interfere with Federal functions, and is undertaken by Federal authority, we shall not impair the Federal Constitution. </para>

              <para>- In this case that is a distinction without a difference. Any sum paid to an honorable member, whether it be called an allowance or not, would come within the income tax provisions. If it would not, he would go free. I do not desire to elaborate my scheme, because, after all, it is merely a suggestion. I am perfectly willing to support any proposal in consonance with Federal law, but it is not easy to draw up such a scheme. I am told, on very fair authority, that for thirty years they have been endeavouring, without success, to pass such a law in Canada. I do not know that they are consumed with any burning desire to succeed. If they are not, that may have something to do with their want of success. </para>

              <para>- If the Government lasted with it, perhaps the Minister would . not object. I merely make this suggestion by the way, and lay no special stress upon it. What I wish to impress upon honorable members is that it is desirable in the interests of the Parliament and the Public Service of the Commonwealth that we should deal with this question before the recess. Provided that the Federal authority is preserved - provided that it is a result of our own act as a Federal Parliament, having authority over our public servants - we ought to be perfectly satisfied to shoulder our. responsibilities as citizens of the States. What we fought for in the recent test cases was the great principle of the control of our own services and agencies, and we have been successful. What we are perfectly prepared to allow the States we claim for ourselves. We recognise as the .very foundation-stone of the Federation the declaration of Chief Justice Marshall that the States and the Commonwealth can only hope to operate on the same citizens, and do their work efficiently  and practically side by side, if the sphere of each is clearly defined. It must be defined so that, without overlapping, without interference, without either impairing the right of the other, they shall be able to work together for the common weal. Justice demands that we shall do our duty as citizens of the States as well as citizens of the Commonwealth. By the decision of the High Court we have demonstrated our rights as citizens of the Commonwealth, and it now remains for us as citizens of the States to do our duties to the States to which we belong. </para>

            <para>- I believe that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat has correctly laid down the constitutional position. I felt from the first that the decision of the High Court was the only possible one; but the solution which the honorable and learned member has suggested is to my mind impracticable. Although we have established a sound constitutional principle, we are face to face with the fact that it has given rise to a feeling of injustice among the citizens of the several States. I shall not occupy the time of the House by dealing with t&#39;his matter, as I might have done earlier in the session ; but I should best express my view of what is the only solution of the difficulty by moving - </para>

          <para class="block">I think that the only solution of the difficulty is that the Federal Parliament should collect the income tax. My experience is that such a tax is fraught with great evils, more particularly in the smaller States. Taxation of this kind would be far better in the hands of the Commonwealth than in the hands of a State. In the little island State of Tasmania several attempts were made to impose an income tax, but they had to be abandoned, because of the inquisitorial nature of such a tax when applied to a small community. Even in New South Wales, the tax has given rise to trouble, owing to the fact that it leads to the undue disclosure of private business matters. </para>

            <para>. - I may mention for the information of the House that this question &#39;has been considered on several occasions by the Cabinet. We are fully impressed with the desirableness of the public servants of the Commonwealth bearing their fair share of the responsibilities of citizenship ; but I can assure honorable members that it is extremely difficult to determine the best method of giving effect to our wishes. There are constitutional difficulties in the way, and we have also to face difficulties in regard to distribution, as well as the fact that there is no uniform income tax in operation. The Government, however, are determined to devise the best means possible, and as soon as they arrive at what they believe to be a fair solution of the difficulty, they will submit their proposals to Parliament. If we are unable to deal with the matter before the close of the &#39;session, that need not necessarily prevent Parliament from making any future legislation retrospective, so .that no one shall be able to escape any portion of a charge that can be legitimately levied upon him. </para>

          <para>- It has been alleged during the progress of this debate, and it was alleged in another place, that a certain combination controls the manufacture, importation, and sale of tobacco in Australia, and that therefore the Federal Government should take over the whole industry for the advantage of its citizens. I would point out, in the first place, that a combination such as is alleged to exist in the tobacco industry is not necessarily improper. During the past nine months we have heard in this Chamber an enthusiastic advocacy of combinations of workmen and employes generally, and if such combinations be justifiable, surely combinations of employers and manufacturers are also justifiable. Combination is hurtful only when it uses power and influence for unworthy ends, such as to gain profit by increasing prices and lowering the quality of the article it sells, by reducing wages, or by harassing the public, or interfering with the public health and comfort in other ways. Before we should be asked to take the tobacco industry under Government control, some more substantial reasons must be given than the alleged fact that a combination is now controlling that industry. The fact that certain persons in the tobacco trade have come to an understanding as to the prices at which they shall sell tobacco is not in itself a sufficient reason why the Commonwealth should take over the manufacture, importation, and sale of that article in Australia. I believe in the Government control of railways, waterworks, and other public services in regard to which, from the nature of things, competition cannot exist, and should therefore be under the control of the State. But the production and manufacture of articles of food, clothing, and consumption generally, does not exclude competition, and therefore Government control is unnecessary and undesirable except in the last resort. The manufacture and sale of tobacco is not <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> a subject for Government enterprise, because tobacco being an article which can be readily produced, imported, and sold, the industry gives scope for competition, and is primarily a subject for private enterprise. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie, and another representative of Western Australia, have quoted the example of the Republic of France in support of their contention that the Commonwealth should take control of the tobacco industry, but an investigation of the facts gives very strong reasons why we should not follow that example. French tobacco is notoriously the worst in the world, and English and American travellers on the Continent invariably take their own supplies of tobacco with them, to avoid having to smoke such a filthy and dirty compound. In support of what I have said about the character of French tobacco, let me quote from a book called <inline font-style="italic">The Soverane Herb,</inline> a history of tobacco, by W. A. Penn, published in 1901, in which, on pages 202 and 203, he says - </para>

The resultant cigarette is indescribably horrible. English smokers fail to recognise it as tobacco.

          <para>As is well known, the products of the State monopoly of France, with the exception of its higher priced cigarettes and smoking tobaccos, are hopelessly inferior. French cigars of domestic manufacture are the worst in Europe - those of Italy alone excepted. The truth appears to be that tobacco manufacture in France has gotten into a rut, and there is not a man in the Republic who is strong enough to pull it out. For so rich a country as France, its State monopoly in tobacco is but a poor revenue producer. </para>

        <para class="block">I would remind honorable members that in Italy, as well as in France, the manufacture of tobacco is a State monopoly. So much for the quality of the article manufactured under State control. Let me now give honorable members the reasons why the manufacture of tobacco was made a State monopoly in France. Louis XIV., about the year 1674, was the first to establish a tobacco monopoly in France, but when the first free Parliament, which the French had had for about 200 years met, it at once abolished that monopoly, it was so seized of its defects. The monopoly was reestablished in 1810 by Napoleon Bonaparte, purely for political reasons. As honorable members know, he was the author of that bureaucratic system of Government which is carried to a further extent in France than anywhere else in the world, and under which as much power as possible is concentrated in the hands of the Ministry of the day. All who vend tobacco in France have to obtain licences from the Minister of the Interior, who has thus placed in his hands a patronage which is used for political purposes, with similar results to those which flow from the &#34; spoils to the victors &#34; system of the United States of America - the friends of the Government are those who are most likely to obtain licences, just as in America the friends of the successful political party are those most likely to obtain billets. </para>

            <para>- It was established in France by Napoleon, whose desire was to obtain as firm a grip as possible on every detail of administration, and to centralize, as much power as possible in the Government. Probably, he also desired to obtain revenue. But what weighed more with him than any Other consideration, as a study of his life and character will show, was his desire for unlimited power. I wish now to discuss the proposal of the honorable member from the point of view of the States. We have just had a debate on the effect of the decision of the High Court in regard to the non-liability of Federal officers for income tax taxation, and the injury thereby caused to the States. We are required by the Constitution to return at least threefourths of the Customs and excise revenue collected until 191 1. If the control of the importation and manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes is taken over by the Commonwealth, the revenue collected upon those articles would not be returnable to the States, butwould be entirely at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government. Thus great injury would be done to the States. In order to enable honorable members to appreciate the great importance of this industry, I would point out that tobacco, next to stimulants, is the most prolific item in the Tariff. From a return furnished at my request by the Collector of Customs in Victoria, I find that in 1903 the revenue collected from the duties upon tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes imported and manufactured in the Commonwealth amounted to &#163;1,370,000. In New South Wales . &#163;595,000 was collected ; in Victoria, &#163;400,000 ; in Queensland, &#163;128,000 ; in South Australia, &#163;80,000; in Western Australia. &#163;130,000; and in Tasmania, &#163;30,000. I have given only the round figures. If three- fourths of this revenue were diverted to the Commonwealth, the States finances would be seriously depleted. Therefore, from this point of view alone the proposal should be very carefully considered. </para>

            <para>- I should not go so far as to say that; but certainly only the gravest reasons would warrant us in taking such a step. It is interesting to note the reasons which have been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. They allege that there is a monopoly in existence, which exercises almost complete control over the manufacture and importation of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes; that the monopoly has resulted in the closing &#34;of factories, the reduction of the number of hands employed, and the lowering of wages; that the combine will not permit retailers to start in business without their .consent, that they dictate the prices at which their manufactured articles shall be bought and sold, that they prevent the retailers from buying from any other firm but Kronheimer and Co., and that alt this tends to increase prices to the consumers. It is also claimed by those honorable members that the Federal Government by taking over the industry could make a profit, in addition to the revenue derived from the existing duties, of ,&#163;673,000, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and &#163;628,000, according to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. That is to say, &#39; that the Commonwealth Government could from this industry extract a revenue of about &#163;2,000,000 annually. Finally, they say that this lovely plum of &#163;2,000,000 per annum could be secured by the expenditure of &#163;1,000,000. No doubt many of us have principles, but if we thought that by expending &#163;1,000,000 we could secure ,&#163;2,000,000 per annum, we should drop most of our principles, and reach out for the &#163;2,000,000. I think I can show, however, that each and every one of the statements I have enumerated is either a gross exaggeration or utterly baseless, that the estimates of the revenue the Government would secure are ludicrous, and that the estimate of the cost of nationalizing the industry is absolutely puerile. In the first place, it is alleged that the tobacco industry is controlled by the combine. I have gone into this matter, in considerable detail, and I shall be in a position to show that the firm of Kronheimer and Co., which, so to speak, is the very head and front of this offending, does not represent all the manufacturers of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes in Australia. </para>

        <para class="block">This <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter</inline> has been giving some most extraordinary statistics to the Select Committee. I am very strongly of opinion that he is at the bottom of all this fuss. He supplied honorable members of the Labour Party with a pamphlet advocating the nationalization of the tobacco industry, and his attitude at the present stage is well worth noting. Years ago, in Victoria, we had what were called &#163;5 licences for the manufacture of cigars. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carter,</inline> with the assistance of some members of the Labour Party., established himself as a manufacturer, and he prospered, waxed fat, and kicked. Then he came to the conclusion that all cigar manufacturers should be charged a licence-fee of &#163;50 - he then being in a position to pay- that amount. Now he goes a length further, and proposes that the Government shall take control of the manufacture and sale of tobacco. The other manufacturers of cigars included in the list from which I was reading are : - </para>

            <para>-  1\he  information which I have obtained can be placed before the Select Committee which is inquiring into this matter, and can be verified upon oath. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie can - if he chooses - submit my statements, which will be contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to that body, and call evidence to rebut them. As regards the import market, I find that the following brands of tobacco are not controlled in any shape or form by the alleged combine : - -Taddy&#39;s, Copes, Ardath Tobacco Co., Craven, Gallagher, Watson and McGill, Zimmer and Co., also Tuckett and Son, and others. The following cigars are also excepted: - F rossard&#39;s, Ormond and Co!, Tinchant and Co., Dresselhuys, Engelhardt and Biermann, S. Wolf and Co., Compania Generale, Manila, as well as all other Manila factories, excepting one, all Havana cigars, excepting those of the Havana Commercial Company, such as Upmann, Partagas, Larranaga, Flor de Benito Suarez, La Excepcion, Figaro, Romeo and Juliet, and many other brands. In cigarettes, all Egyptian, &#34;Turkish, English, and American makers - excepting one in each of these countries - come outside the operations of the alleged combine. It is not a fact that tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes cannot be sold in Australia without the consent of this firm. It is further alleged that this wicked combine has closed a certain number of factories, and thereby reduced employment. That statement is practically without foundation. There is just a scintilla of truth in it. </para>

            <para>- No. The facts are that some years ago Messrs. Dixson and Co. established a number of branches of their Sydney factory. Prior to Federation they were obliged to pay the border duties upon any tobacco which they forwarded to the other States, but with the establishment of Inter-State free-trade they found that it was more economical to manufacture under one roof. Accordingly, they reduced the number of their factories. It is true that one company in Melbourne - the National Cigarette Company - has closed its factory ; but it cannot be denied that there has been a very large increase in the number of persons who are employed in the tobacco trade. The next allegation to which I would direct attention is that the firm of Kronheimer and Co. and others who are interested in the tobacco trade upon a large scale pay their employes sweating wages, and generally indulge in brutal treatment of them. I have here a copy of a letter which was written by the States Tobacco Company ProprietaryLimited to the  President  of the Trades Hall, on the 23rd February last. It reads - </para>

        <para class="block">That letter was published in the press. Having been accused of paying sweating wages to the girls in their employ, this company called upon its accusers to substantiate their allegations.

This challenge was accepted by the Trades Hall Council, and a tribunal was accordingly appointed, consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> H. Bolton, J.

It reads thus - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Some weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan,</inline> representative of the Cigar-makers&#39; Union on the Trades Hall Council, made certain allegations against the States Tobacco Company Limited, to the effect that sweating was being carried on amongst the girls in the company&#39;s employ in Adelaide. The charges were challenged by the company, and eventually they were remitted to a tribunal, consisting of Messrs. F. H. Bolton, R. H. Solly, and R. S. Walpole. The tribunal met yesterday for final consideration of the dispute. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Solly</inline> opened the proceedings by traversing the evidence given by the various witnesses, and quoting from various home authorities as to the meaning of sweating. In his opinion, this was based on the disproportionate wage paid to women in comparison with men employed on similar work. This, he considered, occurred in the work done in the Adelaide factory. After he had spoken for some three-quarters of an hour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> replied, pointing out that the question before the tribunal was a plain-cut issue &#34; whether or not there is any sweated girl labour employed in any of the States Tobacco Company&#39;s factories.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bolton,</inline> in giving judgment, stated that the question resolved itself into one as to whether the cost of covering the machine-made bunches, as fixed by the Wages Board, was too high a minimum, in comparison with the wages paid to cigar-makers for completing a cigar right through without machines. In his opinion, after seeing the wages books of the States Tobacco Company as to what wages an indifferent class of labour had made  per week, he thought the price was too high in comparison with the earnings of the workman who made the cigar right through. He did not consider that the girls iri the factory in Adelaide were being sweated, especially when one compared the wages paid for the small experience attained with those of other trades employing women. </para>

            <para>- I could give the honorable member the wages which are paid in France, where the tobacco industry is a State monopoly. There some of the operatives receive about 2s. per day. The British Australasian Tobacco Company pay the girl employes in their Melbourne factory 15s. 6d. weekly for day work, and 24s. weekly for piece work. In 1904 the average day and piece work wage paid to women employed in the States Tobacco Company&#39;s Melbourne factory was &#163;1 18s. 8d., while the average day and piece work rate for girls was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> os. 11d. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member loses sight of the fact that I am referring to the average wages paid to women and girls in the States Tobacco Company&#39;s Melbourne cigar factory in 1904. It has been alleged that the monopoly has discharged hands and reduced employment. The only statement made in support of that assertion is that a certain commercial traveller was dismissed. It does one good to see honorable members of the Labour Party practically shedding tears over the position of commercial travellers. I should like, now, to put before the Committee a comparison of the hands employed in the factories of the British Australasian Tobacco Company in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as the Melbourne cigar factory of the States Tobacco Company during the last three years. In 1902 they employed 825 hands ; in 1903, 848; and in 1904, 1,103. *n fairness to the honorable member who has submitted this motion, I should deduct from the last: named total the number of persons who have lost their employment as the result of the closing of the National Company&#39;s cigar factory in Melbourne. Fifty-eight persons lost their employment in that way, leaving a total of 1,045 hands employed in these factories in 1904, or a.i increase of 197 as compared with the number employed in 1903. These figures show that the statements that have been made as to the combine having reduced employment are as absolutely baseless as is the charge that it has reduced wages. As a matter of fact, the wages paid in the tobacco trade of Australia are higher than those prevailing in Europe or America. It has been alleged that the firm of Kronheimer Limited has boycotted retailers. No evidence has been submitted in support of that assertion, and I am assured that it is without foundation. Although those who make such an assertion have the protection of a Select Committee, they have not seen fit to submit evidence in support of it to that body. When one gives a moment&#39;s consideration to the facts of the case, he recognises that it is highly improbable thatanything of the kind exists. Kronheimer Limited supply retailers to only a limited extent. The bulk of their trade is done with wholesale houses, who are naturallyglad to sell to any one. The more customers they can obtain the better they are pleased. It has also been said that an attempt has been made to fix a minimum price. In dealing with that point, there are one or &#39; two considerations which we must bear in mind. No attempt has been made to prevent those engaged in the retail trade from obtaining as large a profit as they can from the sale of their goods. But honorable members- who reside in the suburbs of Melbourne know that in a number of trades competition has been so keen that tradesmen have been forced, in selfdefence, to agree as to the prices at which they shall sell their goods. In the grocery trade, for instance, prices have been cut so fine that many men have been forced into the Insolvency Court. The Tobacconists&#39; Association of Victoria have for many years been endeavouring to secure the fixing of a minimum price for a number of articles so as to insure a living wage, and I believe that they have asked the assistance of the wholesale houses in that respect. Whether that course of action be justifiable or not, the combine is in no way responsible for it. I have known grocers and other tradesmen to keep a stiff upper lip in the face of cut-throat competition, and then go  under,  and  in  these circircumstances, I feel that there is a good deal to justify the making of an agreement to sell goods at a certain price in order that the retailers may make as much as they can. That course is followed in all the ordinary walks of life. Whether a man belongs to a trade union or any other body, he usually agrees not to sell his labour under a certain price. A further allegation has been made that, as the result of the combine, the price of goods has been increased to the consumer. In reality, there has been no general increase. It is true that there has been a trifling increase in one or two cases, and a trifling decrease in others ; but nothing more. For example, the price of &#34; Yankee Doodle &#34; tobacco in Sydney has been slightly increased, but that has been due to peculiarly local conditions. In the vast majority of lines, the price to the consumer remains absolutely untouched. I shall not have time to deal with all my notes ; but I desire tobriefly discuss the alleged profit which, according to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, would he secured by a State tobacco monopoly. He did not give all the figures; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in dealing with the matter in another place, made a complete statement of what he thought to be the facts upon which he based his caluculations. </para>

          <para>- When progress was reported last night, I was referring to the fact that the Prime Minister has frequently stated that he fully appreciates the good which has been done by trade unionism, and that if he were an artisan or a workman he would become a member of a trade union. Notwithstanding these declarations, however, he is now asking us to pass into law a measure which, if not materially amended, will, in my opinion, strike one of the most serious blows at trade unionism which it has ever received. Right back from the earliest history, as the workers emerged from slavedom, through serfdom, to their present position, trade unions and organizations have Been forced to secure reforms by political action. It is the trade organizations which have been behind every political reform brought before the public. They have kept reforms to the front until public opinion has been focussed upon them, and legislators have taken them up, and have supported the necessary legislation with all their strength. Long before there was trade unionism in Australia the trade unions played an important part in political reform in England. A few years ago, after the industrial struggles of  189T,  the workers of this country were advised by the members of Parliament, the Judges, and other men in high positions in the States, to abandon the old barbarous method of striking, and to seek to obtain by constitutional means the redress of their grievances. </para>

            <para>- The action of the right honorable member for Swan shows how little interest he is taking in this matter. Otherwise he would know that the Prime Minister dealt with the amendments in a speech which traversed the whole question, and that other honorable members have followed on the same lines. The effect of the advice given in 1891 is shown by the representation of the Labour Party in, not only this Parliament, but every one of the States Parliaments. Now, however, we are asked to pass a measure which will take away the political rights of the trade unionists, and subject them to boycotting throughout Australia. </para>

            <para>- I do not see the relevancy of the interjections. I know of many cases in which men. have been black-balled and boycotted throughout an entire State, because they have been the mouthpiece of their fellows -in order to secure some reform. If preference is not given to unionists when there are just grounds for asking for it, the industrial organization which is the machinery of the Bill will be a curse to trade unionists. </para>

            <para>- That seems to me a technical objection. I am not going into a long discussion of the subject, but I wish to show that the Bill, if passed as it stands, will take away rights which trade unionists at present enjoy, by preventing them from applying for preference if they have spent as much as it would cost to print a poster announcing the holding of a political meeting. That will do them considerable injury. There is no doubt that this measure was introduced primarily in the interests of the trade unionists. If, however, it is provided that no trade union shall incur expenditure in the direction I have indicated, even to the smallest extent, the measure, instead of proving a blessing, will be a curse. </para>

            <para>- The South Australian Act is faulty, and has never been brought into operation. If once this Bill is passed the whole of the trade unions will become subject to it whether they like it or not, and I am appealing to honorable members to divest the Bill, as far as possible, of its objectionable features, in order that it may be made acceptable to those who are most directly affected by it. I wish to say a word or two with .regard to the statements made by representatives of the employers&#39; associations and others who are opposed to .the aims and objects of the Labour Party, to the effect that all the financial difficulties under which we are now labouring in Australia are due to the socialistic legislation which has been passed in the States and Commonwealth Parliaments. I can hardly conceive that honorable members believe that there is any truth in such statements. I appeal to the honorable member for Grampians, whether our present condition is not due to the very heavy losses which have been inflicted upon the community by the disastrous droughts of .the last few years. I find that, during the last ten years, the number of sheep in. four States of the Commonwealth has been reduced from 102,000.000 to 61,000,000. If we assess the value of these sheep at the very low rate of 5s. per head per annum, we shall see at once that we have been sustaining a loss of &#163;15,000,000 per annum for some years past. During the same period, our herds of cattle have been reduced from 11,000,000 to 5,000,000; if we estimate the value of these cattle at &#163;2 per headit will be seen that we have sustained a loss of &#163;.12,000,000 in that direction. We have also to consider the losses incurred by those who are engaged in the dairying industry, and in agriculture generally. Many of the wheat-growers in the State which I represent have cropped their land for seven years in succession, and have taken off very little more than enough grain for  I  seed. I cannot understand how, in the face of- all these facts, honorable members, and others, can say that socialistic legislation is at the bottom of all our troubles. Even if our legislation had proceeded along the lines which honorable members opposite most strongly advocate, we should have been no better off than we are at present. It is contemptible that such utterly unwarranted statements should be made in order to prejudice the minds of the public against a measure which is conceived in the interests not only of unionists, but of employers and the general public. Nothing can be more unsatisfactory to an employer than to know that his hands may knock off work and entirely  dislocate his business at any time. The honorable member for Grampians referred to the great losses incurred by pastoralists during the shearers&#39; strike, and similar disastrous results have followed other industrial disputes. Honorable members should be only too glad to perfect a measure which is designed to prevent the recurrence of the dreadful scenes we have witnessed during labour disturbances, such as those which resulted from the maritime strike, the shearers&#39; strike, and the Broken Hill strike. I trust that honorable members will do their best to render the Bill acceptable to the trade unionists of Australia, who have been commended for doing that which no other workmen in the world have shown themselves prepared to do, namely, handing over the whole of the questions affecting their means of livelihood to the arbitrament of the proposed Court. I feel very strongly with regard to this matter, and I make an earnest appeal to honorable members to divest themselves of all party feeling and to direct their best energies to placing upon the Statute-book a measure that will do justice to all parties concerned. </para>

            <para>- No doubt many idle statements have been made. There is a very general feeling throughout the country that in view of the heavy losses and the hardships that have been incurred, we should avoid doing anything that would tend to destroy public confidence, or to prevent the free investment of capital. If we do anything that will injuriously affect the credit of the country, our recovery will be retarded. It was stated last night that the farmers and pastoralists were not so much exercised in their minds as some people represented with regard to the probable effects of legislation of this kind. I should like to read a telegram which has been addressed: to myself and to the  Chairman,  and which shows that it is feared that the proposed legislation will operate against the common good. The telegram reads as follows :  - </para>

At the same time, I know that alarm is being felt - perhaps more than is justified by the actual facts, because extreme conditions must exist before the Bill could be brought into operation - and that it is feared that legislation of this kind will prevent that free exercise of enterprise which we all desire to encourage in this country. </para>

            <para>- I think that remark is an unfair and unjust reflection upon their sense of justice. I am entirely in sympathy with all the legitimate aims of labour. I have had opportunities of talking with a large number of unionists upon this particular clause of the Bill, and they have assured me that they do not want it. They are satisfied that so long as no unreasonable restrictions are placed in the -way of men gaining admission to the unions, the best men will join the unions, and by reason of their superiority as workmen, and their superior skill over their fellows, will naturally get the preference from employers. I object to the preference provision, because it . is undemocratic. It is absolutely opposed to all -the legislative ideals of the Labour Party. The honorable member for Darling laid great stress upon the fact that he did not wish to countenance class legislation. But I would point out that this proposal constitutes not only legislation for a class, but legislation for a section of a class. Although I credit honorable members opposite with a desire to do what is best in the interests of labour, I do not believe that a majority of unionists would insist upon a provision of this kind being inserted in the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I do not make that statement. I think that any fair Bill which will bring about better relations between employers and employes is worthy of support. I have said more than once that provisions of this character cannot be productive of any permanent good. They do not strike at the root of things. I am compelled to oppose those portions of this Bill which differentiate between one class of citizen and another class, and to re-affirm the principle^ of equal opportunities for all, and special privileges for none, no matter to what class they belong. This is the fundamental basic principle of true democracy, and is now sought to be set aside by the Labour Party. Reverting to the question of the &#34;Open Shop,&#34; I should like to read a short summary which shows what it really means - </para>

          <para>First : It means that the right of non-union and union men to employment is equal, else the equality of right and of opportunity is destroyed. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is the point which I have been emphasizing. In all legislation of this character, equality of opportunity - which should be preserved - is absolutely lost sight of, and a minority are deprived of the right to accept work, save upon certain terms. That is a denial of the very fundamental principle of democratic legislation. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. The honorable member is quoting the summary of an article which refers to what labour unions are doing in the United States.  As there is no law relating to compulsory arbitration in existence there, the extract which he is reading cannot have the slightest bearing upon what unions would do under the operation of a Compulsory Conciliation and Arbitration Bill here. If the scope of the debate is to extend to the United States, we shall not finish this discussion by Christmas. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to enter upon a general discussion of the several amendments made by another place, but I wish to say a few words with respect to the amendment, bringing agricultural and horticultural labourers within the provisions of the Bill. I am more than ever convinced that we have started on wrong lines. When the Bill was first introduced. I said that if we desired to pass an effective measure, we should restrict it to half-a-dozen or more industries of a purely Inter-State character. Instead of doing so, we have sought to apply the provisions of the Bill to the whole industrial life of Australia. The attempt to extend it to agricultural labourers demonstrates the absurdity of the position. We have been told by the honorable member for Bland, the honorable member for Grey, and others, that the Conciliation and Arbitration Acts of New Zealand and New South Wales apply to this class of labourers. But it is strange that, notwithstanding that the New </para>

            <para>- It would be time enough to take such a step when an effort was made to bring this class of labourers under the control of the Court. The same remark applies to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of NewSouth Wales. It would be absolutely impossible to apply such a provision asthis except at the instance of some agitator, and one reason why the farmers object to the proposal is that they fear the interference of such men. </para>

            <para>- There are agitators and agitators. I wish to impress upon honorable members the impossibility of applying such a measure as this to . agricultural labourers. It is strange, but true, that the farming community entertain the opinion that they can manage their farms more effectively on their own lines than they could by acting upon the theories of the Labour Party. I am inclined to agree with them.It is singular that those who are prepared to theorize in this Parliament about the possibility of securing uniformity in the matter of the conditions of farm labourers, are not prepared to go on the land themselves. They could not be drawn on to a farm by a traction engine, yet they are prepared to indulge in beautiful theories as to the right course for farmers to pursue. </para>

            <para>- In the district in which I reside dairying is carried on to a considerable extent, and those engaged in the industry employ a number of milkmen. The ability of these men to milk is only a secondary consideration ; but in the southern districts of Victoria it is of the very first importance. The same remark will apply to the position of harvesters in different districts. Thehonorable member for Bland has told us of a strike which occurred last year in his own district, but I have yet to learn of a case in which agricultural labourers as a body have had occasion to strike because of the conditions under which they were called upon to work. </para>

            <para>- I have nothing to say on that point. These farm hands, who receive&#163;1 per week, have their wages raised to 36s. or 35s. per week during the harvesting season, which lasts from six to ten weeks. What mechanic in the city cansave as much ina year as oneof these men can do? These are pointsto which I invite the special consideration of the Committee. I would impress upon honorable members that it would be impossible to secure uniformity and equality in the conditions under which farm labourers are employed, so as to enable the Court to obtain information for its guidance in determining the rates of wages and hours of labour to be fixed. It would be necessary in the first instance to show that these labourers suffered some injustice. In every manufacturing industry, it is an easy matter to ascertain the cost of production. A man who attempts to manufacture a piece of cloth in Australia can readily ascertain the cost ; but no farmer can foretell the cost of raising a thousand bags of wheat. His experience counts for nothing. He has to incur the cost of buying or leasing the land, and of putting in his crop ; but it is impossible for him to say, until the last, what is the cost of production. He does not know until the harvest season approaches whether he will obtain a single bushel of wheat from the area which he has put into cultivation. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Grey would have men go to bed by Act of Parliament, and rise again in accordance with &#39;the same rigid rule. Has any request been made by the agricultural labourers,&#39; or the farming community generally, for inclusion in this Bill? Decidedly not. The honorable member for Bland told the Committee last night that the measure would protect the farmers from the danger of a strike in the har.vest field. They would, however, never make application to the Court until they wanted the men, and then it would be too late. </para>

            <para>- I followed them as closely as it was possible to do. If the farmers were brought under the Bill, and  a  farmer had made application to a union for what he considered to be a sufficient nunn ber of hands to take off his crop, would&#39; her in the event of the weather conditions rendering it necessary to employ immediately a larger number of hands, and non-union labour offering, refuse to accept that labour ? I think that he would rather disregard the. law than waste the time necessary to apply to the union secretary for more unionlabour, and thus lose his crop, even though that secretary might be in the next town. When farmers realize the possibility of occurrences like that, they feel resentment against the Bill as a whole, although its provisions in other directions may be just. It is true that the community earnestly desires the prevention of industrial disputes; but there is no justification for doing what is uncalled for in order to secure what is right and proper. This Parliament will have enough to do foi a generation to come if it confinesitself to necessary legislation, without reaching out towards the impossible. Knowing what has happened in New Zealand and New South Wales, and having a practical knowledge of farming, I say that there is nojustification for applying the Bill to agricultural labourers, and that they have nodesire to come under it. </para>

          <para>- I desire to indorse what has been said by the honorable members for Grampians and Moira against the inclusion of rural workers in the Bill. There is no question of which I have&#34; had experience during my parliamentary life which has caused such a ferment among the farmers of this State - and I speak only forthe State which I know - as the proposal to bring them under this Bill. I have received&#34; numerous communications on the subject from farmers, and day after day meetings, of farmers protesting against the proposal are reported in the press. This attempt toimprove the position of rural workers will&#39; act to their disadvantage. Rightly or wronglv, the farmer believes that if this provision- is inserted in the Bill, it will be put into, force, and consequently he will not take the risk of cropping his &#39;land. </para>

Why should we cause all this unrest and ferment in the farming community by inserting this provision, if it is not- to be used ? If the amendment is agreed to, the farmers, instead of cropping their land will lock up their machinery, and put their holdings under grass. </para>

          <para>- It is true that, while the honorable member for Echuca was putting forward what he considered to be arguments against the acceptance of the amendment, I smiled -audibly, but that was because the honorable member asked the Committee to believe that the farmers are concerned at the prospect of their industry being injured by a provision which he says will never be put into effect. He told us that if they are brought within the scope of the Bill they will cease to crop their land, and he also said that the experience of New South Wales proves that this provision is never likely to be put into operation. Which of those statements does he wish the Committee to take seriously ? With regard to his observation that whenever the word farmer is mentioned honorable members on this side receive it with sneers- </para>

There has never been an occasion, either in this House or in the Parliament of New South Wales, in which I have not supported every effort to assist the farmers, and I resent the insinuation that I desire to harass them. I am not, however, in favour of enacting class legislation by leaving the farmers outside a Bill which is to apply to all other classes. </para>

          <para>- I indicated on a former occasion that I advocated the inclusion of domestic servants within the scope of the Bill, in order that no distinction might be made between citizen and citizen. Since the Federal Parliament in its wisdom has conferred the franchise upon domestic servants, male and female, I maintain that they are entitled to the full rights of citizenship, and that they should not be treated as a class apart. The Prime Minister made a statement to the effect that there were no unions of agricultural labourers in Queensland, New Zealand, New South Wales, or Victoria. So far as Victoria is concerned, the right honorable gentleman&#39;s statement was correct, but I am in a position to show that he entirely misstated the facts in regard to New Zealand. A large number of agricultural labourers are registered in that colony as members of unions. I shall first quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Tocsin,</inline> which of all the journals published in Victoria, has fought longest in the labour cause. That journal contains the following statement :  - </para>

Subject to the conditions of this award, the employer shall retain the right to conduct his business and manage his property in such manner as he thinks best, and shall make such rules, not inconsistent with this award, as may be reasonable to that end.

        <para class="block">It was unwise for us to use the word &#34; preference.&#34; It would have been much better to have employed the word &#34; protection &#34; to unionists, and to have provided that no employer should be permitted to dismiss a man simply because he belongs to a union. In order that there may be no doubt as to the correctness of the information I have given, I propose to quote from a New Zealand publication, which contains a list of the industrial associations and unions registered under the New Zealand Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, on 30th September, 1904. At page 12 of that publication, I find that the Canterbury Agricultural and Pastoral Labourers&#39; Union is registered under the number 463, the address given being the Trades Council Hall, Christchurch. Upon page 13, the Waimate Workers&#39; Union is registered under the number 327, and the address is given as the Foresters&#39; Hall, Waimate. Honorable members may think that the latter is not an agricultural labourers&#39; union, but I have the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mann, who , was present at Waimate on the date of the registration, for saying that a large number of the members of the union are agricultural labourers. Any one who knows New Zealand must be aware that Waimate is a purely country district, and that agricultural operations are largely carried on there. Upon page 14, I find that the Otago Agricultural and General Labourers&#39; Union is registered under the number 424. Altogether there are four unions ofagricultural labourers, and I think that this fact should convince honorable members that agricultural workers should be brought under the operation of the Bill. The population of New Zealand is not crowded into the cities, as is the case in the various States of the Commonwealth ; and we must recognise that these unions in many cases contain agricultural workers. One of my earliest memories - I am referring to thirty years ago - is that when I was a boy upon the Moorflat station, I was astonished to see one of the employes there retiring to his hut at four o&#39;clock in the afternoon. I inquired of him if he had ceased work for the day, adding that in Victoria men were required to work much later. I shall never forget his reply, which was, &#34; My boy, when you grow up to manhood, you will think that eight hours work per day is quite enough for any man. I retire to my hut at four o&#39;clock to read and to enjoy a well-earned rest.&#34; That disposes of the argument that no union of agricultural workers exists in Australia. I now come to the proposal of the Senate to include domestic servants within the scope of this Bill. I claim that the measure should be made applicable to them. I may add that my view upon this matter would be the same if the ladies of East Melbourne were being subjected to a similar injustice. The other evening I spoke of the cowardly term which is used in England to describe domestic servants. There they are designated &#34; slaveys.&#34; I say that that term should ring throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom as an insult to the intelligence of the community. But in the old country, we must remember that men and women do not enjoy the broad franchise which is bestowed upon all Australian citizens. So far as considerations of citizenship and of humanity are concerned, the mother country occupies a position much inferior to that of Australia. If the people could exercise the wide franchise in vogue in the Commonwealth, they would sweep into oblivion the fetishes which exist there. How many domestic servants are there in our midst? Quoting from that statist of all statists, whose name rings loudest wherever the English language is spoken - I refer to <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> - I find that in 1841, the agricultural labourers of England were the most numerous class of workers, numbering as they did 3,400,000. Next upon the list stood the operatives who were engaged in manufactures. These totalled 3,137,000. The domestic servants constituted the third most numerous class, their numbers being 1,555,000. In 1881, the number of agricultural labourers had declined to 2,561,000; but that of the operatives in manufactures had increased to 4,535,000, and of domestic servants to 2,448,000. It will thus be seen that they still maintained their position upon the list. In 1891 the agricultural workers , had further declined to 2.500,000. Those engaged in manufacture had increased to 9,000,000, and the number of domestic servants had undergone a slight decrease, totalling only 2,341,000. In other words, they were still third upon the list. Comparing these returns with the statistics published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Handbook,</inline> I find that whereas in New South Wales, those engaged in professions or in attending upon professional callings number 41,000, the domestic servants total 72,000, the commercial classes 121,000, and the industrial workers 146,000. Honorable members will recollect that more women than men are employed in the factories and clothing establishments of Victoria. In this State those connected with professions number 35,000, the domestic servants 66,000, the commercial classes 109,000, and the industrial workers 145,000. From these figures it will be seen that the domestic servants stand, third upon the list of workers in Great- Britain, and fourth upon the list in these States. In the primary industries I find that there are 173,000 engaged in New South Wales, and 161,000 in Victoria. If the agricultural workers are to be denied the benefits which would be derived under this Bill, how can any honorable member go before his constituents and justify his attitude in differentiating be- tween one class and another? Is it not almost akin to that harsh word &#34; hypocrisy &#34; for this Parliament, after having conferred upon all adults the right to vote for the return of representatives to frame their laws, to declare that this Bill shall not apply either to the third most numerous calling in Australia, or to those employed in the fourth? My own opinion of second chambers has recently undergone a considerable change. I give my meed of praise to the Senate for its action in connexion with this Bill. It is the most democratic and glorious second chamber speaking the English language to:day. I care little whether the Bill be carried or rejected, but I care much for the stigma of injustice which will attach to us if we carry; it without these amendments. I care also for the myriads of people outside who wil suffer injustice at our hands. I claim that the vast majority of Australians would - if the opportunity were afforded them - do justice to their fellow men and women. I venture to prophecy that if the Bill be returned to the Senate, and if as the result of that Chamber&#39;s insistence upon its amendments, a double dissolution ensues, the country will support the members of the Opposition. It is not my intention to delay the Committee any longer. I have made my protest as vigorously as possible, and with all respect to those whose opinions differ from my own. But I would warn those honorable members who are simply voting against these amendments because they desire to keep a certain party off the Treasury benches, that when the people understand the wrong that is being perpetrated - when they realize the stigma which is being placed on human beings fashioned like ourselves - they may have cause to regret their action. &#39; I say, a plague on both your parties, when it is simply a question of the &#34;ins&#34; and the &#34;outs.&#34; That is the sole consideration ruling the Legislature to-day. The seventy-five members constituting this House, in other circumstances, would gladly do good work for the country ; but when it is a question of the &#34; ins &#34; and the &#34; outs &#34; - when we have one side strenuously fighting for a Bill which will do the greatest good to the greatest number, while others are opposed to it lock, stock, and barrel - the position is different. I believe that but for party considerations, there is not one honorable mem- </para>

It mav not be in accordance with the rules of this Parliament, but I am satisfied that if we could bring the two Houses of the Parliament together to decide without debate whether we should have the Bill as amended by the Senate, or as we sent it up to another place, we should arrive at a decision which would certainly be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- When this question was under our consideration on a previous occasion, I opposed the extension of the Bill to domestic servants. I have since given the matter careful consideration, and have found no reason to alter my opinion with regard to the constitutional difficulty. I believe that, in view of the provisions of the Constitution on which the Bill is based, we cannot apply this principle to domestic servants. Even if it could be so applied, I believe that it would prove inoperatime. At the same time, I have no desire to disagree with the decision arrived at by the Senate, as I think they are likely to insist upon the amendment which they have made. I do not believe that any sane man would say that his home constituted an &#34; industry, &#39; &#39; and as I hold thatdomestic servants cannot be said to be engaged in an &#34;industry,&#34; within the meaning of the Constitution, I feel that we cannot extend the provisions of this Bill to them. For the reason that I have stated, however, I shall support the amendment made by another place. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to discuss this question at length, for the probabilities are that we shall have a repetition of the vote which has just been given. I desire, however, to protest against the exclusion of so important a section of the community as are the agricultural labourers and domestic servants. I presume that the Government are in earnest in their desire to pass this measure. It is a Bill which, according to its title, is designed to prevent strikes and locks-out, and to secure the settlement of industrial disputes by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Through the agency of the Court, employers and employes will be brought together, and any industrial dispute arising between them will be peacefully settled. In this way it is hoped to prevent the recurrence of the disastrous strikes which we have experienced in Australia, with all the inconvenience, loss and misery which they entail. With this high ideal before us, we are asked to excludea large section, of the community. The honorable member for Melbourne has quoted very telling figures from <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> with reference to the number of agricultural labourers and domestic servants in England and Australia, and I think that the facts that he has placed before us are worthy of serious consideration. The Government invite the Committee to exclude those engaged in all branches of farming, as well as in domestic service, from the operation of this measure. We are now legislating for the whole Commonwealth, and I should like to know why these industries should be excluded, while others which are closely allied to them are not. It has not been clearly shown why the Bill should not be made applicable to those engaged in every calling. I can quite understand the attitude taken up by the representatives of Victoria, in view of the fact that all attempts to extend the factory legislation of the State to those engaged in farming have been strenuously resisted. But in New South Wales the position is wholly different. A State Conciliation and Arbitration Act is in operation there; and is applicable to those engaged in agricultural pursuits, as well as in shearing, and many other industries. It is quite possible, therefore, that the farmers of that State may be brought under an award of the State Court. That is a point which is worthy of attention. The products of the farmers of New South Wales have to compete with those of this State; and if they are brought under the operation of the State conciliation and arbitration law, the producers there may be placed at a disadvantage. Why should we not extend this Bill, which is expected to do so much in the direction of bringing about better industrial conditions, to all persons engaged in farming pursuits throughout the Commonwealth ? It has been contended that it is unlikely that disputes will arise among those engaged in the agricultural industry, or in domestic service. If we make provision for them in this Bill, and no disputes occur, the Act will remain inoperative, so far as they are concerned ; but if,on the other hand, any trouble arises, we shall be prepared to cope with it. We should not legislate for a class; our legislation, as far as possible, should be applicable to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. We are charged with the important duty of legislating for all Australia, and why should those who are seeking a livelihood as farm hands or domestic servants be excluded from participating in the benefits of a measure of this kind? For these reasons I shall support the amendment. I trust that better counsels will prevail, and that honorable members opposite will withdraw their opposition to the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I have not previously given my reasons for supporting the amendments made by the Senate. I am a farmer, and as a representative of a farming constituency, wish to explain why I consider that agricultural labourers should not be exempted from the Bill. In my constituency, many farmers are engaged in the dual industry of wool raising and wheat production, upon a very large scale. Within the last few years large areas of land in my electorate, which were previously used solely for grazing purposes, have been put under the plough and devoted to wheat production. We have the same employers engaged in both branches of the industry, and they have to find a market for their produce, not in the Commonwealth, but beyond it. They have to cater for the needs of the old world. In some parts of New South Wales we have men working as shearers and as farm labourers, during different portions of the year, for the same employers. If the amendment is not agreed to we shall tell these people that, as growers of wool and meat they may come under the provisions of the measure, but as agriculturists they cannot enjoy its benefits, because the agricultural industry is outside its scope. Though, as pastoralists, they may settle their disputes with their employes by conciliation and arbitration, if, as agriculturists, they have disputes with their employes, they must revert to the old barbarous methods of strikes and locks-out. But if the measure can give efficient protection to those engaged in one branch of rural production - and that is claimed by the Government - it is, in my opinion, capable of giving equally efficient protection to the branch which they propose to exclude. On the other hand, if it is incapable of serving the agricultural interest, it is equally incapable of serving the grazing interest. In my State, both agricultural and pastoral interests come under the State Arbitration Act. That measure provides for the control of agricultural disputes equally with grazing disputes ; but if the Federal legislation, which deals not with disputes confined to any one State, but with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, is so lop-sided as to apply only to grazing disputes, an injury may be done to the agriculturists of New South Wales through the spreading of a dispute to that State from another State, for which there will be no remedy. If this is to be a good and beneficial piece of legislation, it should apply to every industry, and to every person engaged in that industry, male or female. Every such person should have a right to regard it as a means for obtaining redress for industrial grievances. Therefore, I protest against the proposal of the Government to apply it only to certain industries, and to thus make it a piece of class legislation. </para>

        <para class="block">I wish the Court to be absolutely untrammelled in the exercise of the power to grant preference. In my view, the experience gained in New Zealand and New South Wales is quite sufficient to justify us in the belief that the practice there established, of always insisting that the unionists shall &#39;reasonably represent those engaged in a trade or calling before preference is granted, would be followed by any Court constituted as the result of this measure. One has, however, to accept the fact that the Committee upon a former occasion insisted that a majority should be shown to exist in favour of preference before it could be granted, and I am willing, as one, to so far give in to the voice of the majority. In a spirit of anxiety to have the measure passed in something like an effective form, I am quite willing to accept the provision with regard to the majority, so long as the onus is placed upon those who oppose preference, of showing that the majority are on their side. Honorable members opposite argued that it was an easy matter to prove that a majority existed one way or the other. </para>

            <para>- And I say so still, but I am -proposing to put honorable members opposite to the test of their own convictions. They said that it would be comparatively easy_ to discover upon which side the majority lay, that the Court would be guided by common sense, and would not insist upon a mathematically accurate demonstration of the numbers of those affected by the award. If that be so, what objection can they have&#34; to shaping the clause in the way I propose? If they believe in their own medicine, why should they not be willing to take a dose of it? If, on the other hand, they now discover that there will be some difficulty in the working of the clause, I say that they give away their whole case as against the proposition which we put forward previously. </para>

            <para>- I am giving&#39; the Minister an opportunity to prove that there is nothing ulterior behind his own proposition, and that all that is aimed at is to insure that the majority rests on one side or the other. If the amendment be carried, what will be the position? Those who ask for preference will still have to convince the Court that it is right for them to grant preference. They will have to submit all their considerations to the Court, to show how many members are in their union, and how far, within reason - as the practice now prevails in New South Wales - they represent the body of men employed in the trade or calling. All that process will have to be entered upon and carried through before the stage is reached of discovering whether there is a majority opposed to preference or not. The Court has to be satisfied that preference is a justifiable demand. </para>

They will first have to convince the Court that preference is justifiable. Presuming that they do so convince the Court, then, under the amendment, the opposing counsel could say, &#34; Very well, your Honour, the Court is convinced that preference should be granted, but we have now to put forward the fact that the majority of those affected by the award are against preference being granted.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I do not complain of reasonable interjections, but at the sametime I appreciate your anxiety, sir, to maintain order. I do not object to interjections which discover views which may be met as I proceed with my argument. With regard to the contention that it will not be necessary to ascertain definitely the views of individuals outside of the unions, in order to prove that the majority of those affected by the award are in favour of preference, I would ask how that information is to be gained, except by consulting the majority of those who are likely to be affected by the award. I do not wish at this stage to enter upon the argument which was engaged in at some length a few months ago on the question of who are likely to be affected by the awards, although I hold a very strong view that that question will be pushed to a far greater extreme than a number of honorable members are inclined to admit. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Lang is taking up exactly the same attitude as that assumed by the honorable member for Wentworth. No doubt that is due to the fact that neither of those honorable members were members of the last Parliament. If they had been here they would have known that we transgressed that beauteous principle of British law on several occasions, and yet the heavens have not fallen, and there still seems to be some respect for the powers that be. In both the Customs and Excise Acts we provided distinctly that, except in regard to indictable offences, the onus of proof should lie upon the defendant. </para>

We can sec now that some honorable members are beginning to discover that there is some ground for objection to this particular clause, that, even according to their own admission, it has a two-edged effect. In view of the fact I have stated, that in two other statutes this Parliament has provided that the onus of proof shall be upon the defendant, except, of course, in cases involving serious offences which are indictable, it doss seem to me that the objection urged by honorable members carries no weight when put forward- in regard to this particular case. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and it has also bean adopted in connexion with gaming and other laws, under which the defendant is required to show that he was in a certain place for a good purpose, the police being relieved of the responsibility of showing that he was there for an improper purpose. Presuming that a union is asking for preference, my proposal does not relieve it of the necessity of making out a good case before the Court. The only proposition I put forward is that if the Court is satisfied that preference is justifiable, the applicant union will still have to run the gauntlet of the majority of those engaged in the industry - if that majority takes sufficient interest in the matter to disclose itself. All the arguments advanced by honorable members as to the workable character of this clause in its original shape apply with as much force to the proposed amended form. I trust the Committee will see its way clear to adopt my amendment, and) thus afford some possibility of making &#39;this preference provision a workable one. </para>

I have never yet met a man who objected to having his object expressed in clearer language. There would have been no objection to an amendment of that character.

            <para>- As the result of his labours, the honorable member has submitted an amendment upon&#39; this clause which, it seems to me, is repugnant not only to the ordinary rules which prevail in connexion with legislation and the onus of proof, but to the spirit of any proposal limiting preference at all. We all know - honorable members opposite have made no secret of the matter - that when a Labour Government was in office they accepted a number of amendments with which they were not in accord. We have always recognised that they accepted them, not because they liked them, but because they occupied a Ministerial position, which entailed responsibility, and which to some extent fettered the fearless independence which they enjoy when they are in an irresponsible position. They accepted certain amendments of an important character which were not agreeable to them as matters of principle. I do not blame the honorable member for Bland for his action- </para>

            <para>- I do not blame the leader of the Opposition or his supporters for attempting to get back to the naked principle of preference, in which they sincerely believe. They believe that a preference should be extended to unionists, absolutely unshackled by any sort of regard to the rights of workers who are not members of trade unions. That is a simple statement of fact. As so much effort has been expended in an effort to make it appear that the principle of compulsory arbitration is inseparably associated with preference to unionists, I should like to read the words of the author of the New South Wales Arbitration Act, from which a great deal in this Bill has been copied. He is a man of great distinction, and is acknowledged to be perhaps the leading authority in Australia upon a measure of this character. As is well known, the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed under the auspices of the Attorney -General of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R. Wise, a gentleman who is not altogether unknown to honorable members. We all recognise that any statement which he makes upon questions of fact or intention can be implicitly accepted throughout Australia, and therefore I ask honorable members to implicitly accept the statements which he made in the Legislative Council on the 31st October, 1900, when moving the second reading of this Bill. I quote his words, because they bear upon the particular matter referred toby my honorable friends. </para>

My honorable friends, however, declared that they could not accept that solution, and I hope that &#39;they will allow me to continue the quotation, because it is in the nature of an assurance to a House of Parliament which was asked to pass a similar Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> continued - </para>

            <para>- If preference is to be given in any Bill, how can any one urge that a man who is not a member of a trade union is not compelled to join one ? I admit that in the sense of tyranny, he is not compelled to do so. He is at liberty to stand back and to see members of certain trade unions pass before him, and obtain any employment that may be offering. I say that if we make a distinction between unionists and nonunionists who are engaged in the same trade - if we provide that a man shall obtain a preference if he joins a union, but that he shall be shut out from employment if he does not - we apply to him the most cruel compulsion in the world. It is true that we do not touch him in his views of abstract questions. We do not affect his religious or political convictions; but we touch him upon the point which is vital to every indi- vidual who has to support those who are near and dear to him by the labour of his hands. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> continues - </para>

We have conceded the principle of preference, with the qualification, not that a majority of trade unionists shall claim it, because we leave&#39; all non-unionists free to express their wish that a preference shall be extended to unions to which they do not belong ; but the test which we apply is that a- majority of those engaged in any industry which would be affected by an award of the Court must first approve of the granting of that preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> continues </para>

Is it because it means nothing ? Is it because it will have no industrial operation or effect - that it will not help one man as against another? Is it because it will not help the member of a trade union as against the man who, in the exercise of his rights as a democrat, independently refuses to join a union? </para>

I hope he will allow me to express my own views in the frankest and most straightforward fashion. That is a right which is still left to honorable members.

            <para>- I do not object to any preference which men may secure by legit mate agitation - by the assertion of their rights as individuals, or as members of trade unions. But the point at which I stop is that a Court of Justice created by this new Australian Parliament should be called upon to decree this preference under the operation of law. I object to the contention that they are to place on trade union certificates the stamp of the Commonwealth of Australia,&#39; and by means of fines and penalties to deprive workmen of employment.

            <para>- That is not an answer to my question ; the honorable member is now indulging in mere speculation. The fact remains that this principle was accepted in the interests of the magnificent objects of the Bill, which are recognised by the great majority of the people of Australia. The principle of preference was accepted, as many other things have been accepted, subject to the principle of some sort of majority rule. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, there has been no naked assertion of the principle of the right of a trade unionist, by the mere fact of his being a member of a union, to claim preference. Are we to leave the Court in such a position that it will have no indication from the Legislature of the principle upon which this discretion should be exercised? The value of the amendment moved by the honorable and learned member for Corinella when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion is that it gives the Court a clear indication of the rules upon which its discretion should be exercised. We must remember that it will not be a Court in which every statement must be proved according to the dry precision of ordinary Courts of law, whose decisions are liable to be upset. This will be a Court of equity of the freest kind. It will be absolutely free from the technicalities of a Court of law. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the honorableand learned member will allow me to make myself heard. This Court will not be asked, as an ordinary Court of law is asked, topronounce opinions on questions of law. It is not asked to be satisfied in the driest legal sense that an application for a prerference is supported by a majority of those affected. If, in the opinion of the Court, a majority of those affected in the industry are in favour of the preference, it will know what it may do, and will be ableto do it. We are asked by the amendment moved by the honorable member for Bland,, to adopt an extraordinary course. It is remarkable that my honorable friend should be prepared to seriously submit such a proposition if he allows the principle of majority rule at all. The amendment has one advantage. If it is a genuine one,, honestly submitted, it clearly binds my honorable friends opposite to the acceptance of the principle of majority rule. </para>

            <para>- If this is an honest amendment, intended to deal seriously with a grave difficulty in a measure of national importance, it begins by acknowledging the principle that an application for preference must have the support of a majority of those affected. That has been the decision of .this House, and, so far as the amendment recognises the principle which this House has affirmed, we have no objection to it. But, whilst on the platform, one can make these statements, and propose amendments of this kind, we are compelled in a House of Parliament to consider individually whether such an amendment would really carry out the principle which it acknowledges. Look at the burden which is put upon those who have no corporate existence. A trade union is a large, organized, powerful body. These bodies have nearly become the masters of all the political power of the Commonwealth. But there is one place in the Commonwealth where political power and political organization, however strong, ought never .to be allowed to rule, and that is a Court of Justice. Throughout the great struggles for liberty and for despotism in our grand old mother country, where .the tide of liberalism has been forced on for centuries past, it has always been our boast that whilst the Tories and the Radicals may fight, and properly fight, on the open platform of honest political agitation, there is one temple where these rival political forces must never intrude. It&#39; is one of the boasts of the country from which we have obtained our traditions and our institutions that these rival political forces can never interfere with the even, impartial flow of British justice. Whilst in this new land we may perhaps be more adventurous in many respects, and wisely more adventurous than our forefathers in the old land  - whilst we do not shrink from a progress which may terrify in the old country - all parties have agreed to leave our Courts of Justice severely alone. No party, great as it may be. has ever been able to influence the decisions of our Courts. </para>

            <para>- I am not speaking in a personal sense. The honorable member for Grey knows .that I have no personal feeling against him; but I think that I ought to be allowed to make a statement on behalf of the Government upon this important question. I repeat that the proposal put forward by the Opposition is an extraordinary one. In our every-day experience, whether as Members of Parliament, as candidates, as electors;, or as members of various political, social, or business bodies in the community, we all are familiar with the meaning of the expression, &#39;&#39; the will of the majority.&#34; But of all the daring innovations applied to Courts of Justice, this would be the most daring. There are two bodies of organized forces ; there is certainly one, so far as the workers are concerned. Individual workers will not be able to go to the Court, and claim its advantages. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend1 at present to answer that question. I am dealing with another point. I admit that in a dispute before the Court an employer may be a single individual ; but, so far as the workers are concerned, only an organized body can appear before the Court as a party to a dispute between employers and employes. </para>

            <para>- I come back to this question. Let us take a dispute before the Arbitration Court, between a large employer, or a corporation of employers, and a large body of trade unionists. The body of trade unionists apply to the Court for a preference in their branch of industry over all the other workers in Australia. There is no one there to represent those other workers, who have no organization, and no means to express their opinions, and are scattered over the length and breadth of Australia. </para>

I do not regard him as a source of danger. But the views of those behind him are not of such a rational and moderate character. I wish, however, to get back to the question, what have the disorganized, friendless workers of Australia, who are scattered all over the. Continent, to do in order to express an opinion ? They have to go to the employers ; they have to ask the employers to be good enough to help them. I ask honorable members who have the slightest glimmer of fairness in this matter, what would be the opinion of a Judge if employers took workers under their protection, and came to the Court in their case and on their behalf? What scepticism the Court would feel in regard to employers who tried to act as the friends and legal representatives of the non-unionisfts of Australia ! </para>

            <para>- Any man, whether unionist or non-unionist, would have a contempt for a union organized by the other side, under the guise of friends of the workers of Australia. Surely we should all have a con- tempt for anything of the sort. I have already expressed my opinion, without any disguise, in regard to the union referred to by the honorable member for Bland, but I do not call the non-unionist workers of Australia bogus. I do not call them blacklegs and parasites. I consider them to be men who areentitled to the protection of the laws of the land, and to some show of justice. </para>

            <para>- The attempt is now being made to put the onus of proof upon disorganized workers, who are scattered throughout Australia, instead of on the organized trade unionists. Why should the onus of proof be thrown on men who ask only for equal opportunities to earn their living? What has the country come to? Have we sunk so low that when we get to the very bed-rock necessity of a human being, to live in decency, the onus of proof that he is entitled to doso is thrown on him, and he is required to prove what is, in form, an affirmative, though practically a negative? The effect of the proposal of the honorable member for Bland would be that the moment an application for preference was made by a union, the duty would be cast upon the Judge - though my friends would like him to take no concern on that point - to consider whether there was a majority. In form, there is an admission of the principle which we desire to enforce, but by a cruel twist of the clause the burden of proof is taken from the shoulders of the strong and put on the shoulders of the defenceless. It is taken from the shoulders of the litigating party in the Court and put on the shoulders of the artisans who are unrepresented, and are scattered over the Continent. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member will not get the party behind him to admit that if the members of a trade union happen to be in a minority they should not have preference. Do my honorable friends say that? They have suddenly become so timid that they point to the bell-wether, and desire him to speak for them. Honorable members who, upon other occasions, fearlessly express their own democratic convictions, when I now put a question to them, point to my amiable and moderate friend the leader of the Opposition. Coming back again to the amendment itself, which admits that the Court must have regard to the question of majority,. I say that the proposal that some persons residing in scattered localities, thousands of miles apart, are to come into Court and prove that they represent a majority, is one of the most extraordinary ways of testing such a question of which we could conceive. That is my view. Now let us test this provision by applying it to the case of the trade unions which this Bill was specially designed to meet. I think that we can in this wayshow whether our amendment is unreasonable or not. You cannot test a novel experience of this kind where everything is in the dark by precise examples. All you can do is to regard the existing industrial facts throughout Australia in order to judge what kind of dispute will in all probability be submitted to this high tribunal. As the honorable member for Hume has pointed out on more than one occasion - with an accuracy which I do not always perceive in that honorable member - only members of the large unions will be affected by this Bill, which is designed to deal with disputes extending beyond any one State - the seamen who work all round the coast of Australia, the marine engineers, who are employed in the same way, and the shearers, whose work requires them to move from one State to another. It is a notorious fact that the Shearers&#39; Union, the Seamen&#39;s Union, and the Marine Engineers&#39; Institution, and. I think that I might add the Wharf Labourers&#39; Union, the members of which work all round Australia - every one of these great organizations, whose affairs are likely to be submitted for the decision of this Court represent an overwhelming majority of those engaged in the respective callings followed by their members. What difficulty would the officers of the Seamen&#39;s Union have if they came before the Arbitration Court in proving that they represented a majority of the persons engaged in navigating round our coasts? We know that they have an overwhelming majority. </para>

            <para>- I am perfectly well aware of that, but I am not dealing with that point at all. I am dealing with the objection raised by the leader of the Opposition. Does the honorable member for Bland seriously contend that, if the officials of the Seamen&#39;s Union appeared before the Court, and asked for preference, the Court would ask them to take a poll of the members of their union in order to ascertain if they wanted preference? That is a wonderful difficulty which exists only in the imaginations of honorable members opposite. What is the advantage of organization? That the officials of a union can appear before the Court as representatives of every man in it, and that, when they make application in the name of the union, the onus of proving that their principals repudiate it is thrown upon some one else. I think that these difficulties are quite delightful. I can quite understand the state of mind into which honorable members have been thrown over this clause. They have some idea that when a great union asks for preference, proof must be afforded that each man joins in the application. The whole idea is simply absurd. , </para>

            <para>- I decline to recognise the right of the honorable and learned member to interrupt me. I have a personal objection to his interjections. As I have pointed out, the officials of the Seamen&#39;s Union would have no difficulty in proving that their members represented the vast majority of the men engaged in coastal navigation. The Shearers&#39; Union, embracing  20,000 shearers, would have no difficulty in proving to the satisfaction of a Court of equity that it represented a majority of the shearers in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I should think the union would have some ready means of proving that its 20,000 odd members represented a majority of those engaged in shearing. It would be more easy for the union to do that than for 20,000 units, scattered throughout Australia, to prove that the majority of those engaged in the occupation were opposed to preference. I can understand the position of honorable members opposite. This is not the fight they want. Their fight is against these men altogether. They are endeavouring to obtain preference for a union containing 250 members against 2,000, or even 20,000, other men. Honorable members may laugh, but they cannot deny my statement. </para>

Either they are in favour of this majority principle, or they are not. As I have pointed out, the amendment says they are. They are in favour of the majority principle, but they throw upon the disorganized units the onus of proving practically a negative against a powerful union which is organized. If the disorganized units can satisfy the Court upon this point, the organized bodies can do it much more easily. I rest my whole case upon that fact. This Bill contains the principle- </para>

I never object to an interruption or two, but only to a sort of organized union of disturbance. It is not the units to which I take exception, but the battery.

            <para>- Then the honorable member might quote me to better advantage, and at a more seasonable time. I say again that my friends have committed themselves in this matter by the terms of their amendment. It is not that they like it ; but from the exigencies of the present situation, they have endeavoured to approach us in such a way that honorable members on this side may change their votes, and accept the Bill as amended, on the ground that it protects the rights of a majority. That is the basis on which we are asked to vote for the amendment. I have pointed out that this proposal is a cruel sham. So far from protecting the rights of the disorganized majority, if that majority is unfavorable to preference, it imposes on them a cruel, unjust, and unprecedented onus and burden which it is impossible that they could discharge. When honorable members retort that that is what the Bill does as it stands, I reply that that is not so. I have quoted all the great organized bodies - the only bodies ever likely to come into the Court . - all of whom can, without the slightest difficulty in the world, prove the existence of a vast majority of unionists. </para>

            <para>- My reply is because, a majority of this House believe that when this preference is to be within the power of a British Court of Justice, and when it affects the daily rights and opportunities of the working citizens of Australia, the Judge should at least have an opinion - having the discretion in a Court of equity to arrive at that opinion - that there is a majority, not of trade unionists, but a majority of trade unionists combined with others outside engaged in the industry, who have no objection to preference. That is what this House is anxious about. If that were conceded, there would be no difficulty ; if it were a mere transposition of words, what difficulty would there be in accepting the amendment? But, instead of that, the principle is left in, and a condition is imposed which makes it a sham, and I do not think that any honorable member who voted for the principle can consent to that. </para>
