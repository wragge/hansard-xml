            <para>- I wish to ask the Postmaster-General a question without notice. I am informed that c-.very mail brings from England a large quantity of printed matter, consisting of price-lists, market reports, and catalogues, much of which is refused by the addressees because of the charges made on it by the Postal Department. &#39; On what principle does the Department proceed in making these charges ? </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend was good enough to inform me of his intention to ask this question. The charges are made in pursuance of an arrangement between the Customs and Postal Departments. I will read the information which I have on the subject: - </para>

            <para>Tariff item 122  (a)  is as follows :  - &#34; Paper - Manufacturers of, Unframed, for advertising purposes, including price lists, catalogues, and all printed or lithographed matter for such purposes, per lb., 3d.&#34; </para>
            <para>But the undermentioned concession was authorized in the <inline font-style="italic">Tariff Guide: -</inline> &#34; Catalogues or price lists. Single copies received from exporting houses for the use of merchants may be admitted free of duty. This privilege is not to apply to those imported for distribution.&#34; </para>
            <para>On the nth April, however, the late Minister directed that such concession should cease, and an order was issued accordingly to the effect that on and after 1st September next all price lists and catalogues will be charged duty, irrespective of the purpose for which imported, or to whom addressed. </para>
            <para>The collection of duty on single catalogues is attended with some difficulty. In cases where the circulars or catalogues are consigned to an agent in Australia, for distribution here, the procedure is simple, as the agent is enabled to pay duty and clear the whole as a bulk line. But when the articles are addressed singly, the collection of duty is not such an easy matter. </para>
            <para>In some cases the amount payable on each catalogue would not exceed one penny, and it would be manifestly impossible to expect each addressee to call at the Post Office and clear his or her particular catalogue or circular. The following plan, adopted in Victoria hitherto, appears to offer the only satisfactory solution of the difficulty. </para>
            <para>The duty payable is made a surcharge on the packet, by means of postage due stamps, and is collected by the Post Office officials from the addressee before delivery. The revenue thus  obtained is credited to the Postal Department, instead of to Customs, .but both Departments being under the Commonwealth, this does not appear a very serious objection. Moreover, it is very probable that many persons to whom the advertising matter is addressed, will refuse to accept delivery when the payment of the surcharge is  inflicted,  so that it is not likely the amount of revenue at stake will be very large. </para>
            <para>The Minister of Trade and Customs has approved of the foregoing, and the concurrence  of  the Postmaster-General is sought, in order that the system may be put in operation. </para>
            <para>The Postmaster-General of the day accordingly gave bis concurrence to the arrangement. </para>

              <para>- The charges are made under the Tariff Act. The whole  question was submitted to the Minister of Trade and Customs and to the PostmasterGeneral of the day, and as the difficulty of collecting the duty on single packets was very great, it was agreed that the PostmasterGeneral should collect it by way of surcharge. </para>

            <para>- I wish <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> know from the Treasurer if the returns on page 6 of his Budget papers, as to the production of sugar by white and by black labour, have been verified ? In Queensland the results are shown to be so extraordinary that I feel certain that the figures cannot be correct. It is stated, for instance, that in 1902, 1,521 whites produced 12,254 tons of sugar, and 975 blacks produced 65,581 tons. In 1902 the white growers produced one-eighth of the quantity of sugar produced by the black growers; in 1903, onesixth; and in 1904, one-seventh. In 1902, -the whites produced 8 tons per man per annum, and the blacks 67. In 1903, the whites produced <inline font-style="italic">12</inline> tons per man per annum, and the blacks 60 tons ; and in- 1904, the whites produced 14 tons per man per annum, while the blacks produced 97 tons per man per annum. The figures for New South Wales are much more reasonable, and seem to be correct. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned member misapprehends the meaning of the word &#34;producer.&#34; The figures do not refer to the men actually working as labourers on the cane fields ; the number of producers is the number of persons registered as owners of properties on which cane is being grown. While the white producers - that is, the registered proprietors, who grow Cane solely with the aid of white labour - have generally small holdings, many of the black producers - that is, the proprietors who grow cane with the aid of black labour - are companies, and hold large areas, employing a large number of men. </para>

              <para>- It is not meant that the proprietor of the plantation is a white man or a black man, but that he employs white or black labour, as the case may be. I believe that the figures  aTe  correct. The Treasury has no means of checking them, but they were supplied by the Customs Department from information obtained by Customs officials in New South Wales and Queensland. I myself saw that the acreage of black and white production was very nearly alike in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- I am giving the information supplied to us as to the area under cultivation. I saw there was a great discrepancy in the production of sugar; and&#39; my idea was that it arose from the fact that those who employed white labour were in the southern parts of the sugar districts, where there has been cultivation for year&#39;s, and where the crops are not so large as in the northern parts, where the greater part of the black labour is used, and there is practically virgin soil. That was my idea of th&#39;e explanation ; but to be on the safe side, I telegraphed to the Collector in Queensland for information. I learn from my officers that a telegram has been received to-day, saying that a letter containing the information will arrive to-morrow, and to that letter I shall give every publicity. </para>

          <para>. - I promised tomake a statement to the House with reference to the proposals of the Government as to the business for the remainder of the session, and I propose to make that statement now. I think the Government will consult the convenience of honorable members generally if an effort be made to so despatch public business as to enable Parliament to rise in the beginning of December. That is the desire of the Government ; but, of course, we are prepared to continue beyond that date if necessary. We ask the co-operation of honorable members, and of members of the Senate, to endeavour to bring about the result I have indicated. I should now like to mention the matters with which we propose to deal before the session closes. Before doing so, however. I may point out, not only for the information of the House, but for the information of the public generally, that, as a matter of fact, for the past eighteen months there has (been a recess of only something under a month, and that was a recess prior to indulging in the pleasures of a general election. I think that fact ought to be known as a reply to a number of people outside, who are always speaking to the countrv as though this Parliament were never in session. As a matter of fact, there is no Parliament in the world which is so much in session. </para>

            <para>- I should not like to make the remark just uttered by the honorable member for Franklin, but as the result of my experience generally, since I came into public life, I will say that itby no means follows that the longer the session the more the work. My impression is that it sometimes happens that when sessions are not of undue length more work is done than if they are long. </para>

            <para>- That is sometimes the fact. This House met, as honorable members know, at the beginning of March, so that by the beginning of December we shall have been in session for nine months of the year. There may be some rare exceptions in the Chamber who would like to sit for twelve months in the year; but I do not suppose honorable members who come from very distantparts of Australia are anxious to be complete exiles from their States. Whether that be so or not, the Government propose to use every legitimate effort to bring the public business to an end by the beginning of December. </para>

            <para>- I do not care how much earlier we may complete the business, but I do not think it possible to fix an earlier date. In the first place, the Government is earnestly desirous that the Arbitration Bill should be finally dealt with before the prorogation - that is a foremost matter of importance in connexion with the measures now before the two Chambers. Then after the Budget debate is finished I think it is of pressing importance that we should pass the Estimates, and get to the first stage of the Appropriation Bill. I think honorable members will agree with me that the Papua Bill ought to be completed this session. We have only one clause for consideration in this House, all the others having been passed; and I think honorable members will be of opinion that the sooner the management of this Possession is put on a business footing the better. </para>

            <para>- As I intimated, I shall yield to any reasonable request in that direction. If I omit any Bill in. the course of this statement, I shall be glad if some honorable member will remind me of it, because I did forget to mention one or two on the last occasion. Now, however, I have provided myself with notes, so that I do not think there will be any mistake. The Government also hope to complete the Transcontinental Railway Survey Bill, and I may here sav that both Houses of the Western Australian Parliament have passed resolutions to reserve twenty-five miles on both sides of the route within the State. We shall also have to. introduce a short Billto amend the Defence Act, practically, however,  only in one respect. The Government propose to submit to the House the result of their deliberations with reference to a system of reorganization of the Military Forces, and the decision we have arrived at involves some slight alteration of the Defence Act. We are very sorry to have to add this Bill to the list, but an amendment is absolutely necessary to bring about the changes the Government intend to submit to the House. The Minister of Defence proposes, under an arrangement which I feel sure the House will sanction, to make his statement as to the proposed reorganization in Committee of Supply on the Estimates. He will do so very soon after the discussion on the Estimates has begun, so that honorable members may have some interval of time in which to consider his propositions before we reach the Defence Estimates. The Cabinet came to a final decision only today, but the Minister of Defence will be prepared on Tuesday to make his statement, and the Defence Estimates will be postponed for a reasonable time in order, as I have said, to give honorable members full time to consider the proposals. We hope, also, to pass the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. This measure has been passed by the Senate, and if we can deal with it this session it willbecome an Act. I do not desire to go into any details as to some provisions of the measure which mav have to be considered, but, if it be possible, I am sure honorable members on both sides will be glad to have it passed into law. Then there is a short Bill we should like to complete, but I admit it deals with a subject of some difficulty, namely, the extraordinary conditions under which persons have to ship fruit from Australia to other countries. The whole subject will have to be considered, probably, in connexion with the Navigation Bill. We think that the conditions which shipping agents and shipowners impose upon consignors of perishable products sent from Australia are so foreign to common sense and equity that it will be necessary to control them by Act of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I donot care what honorable members call it, so long as they pass it. Some day or other we shall have a set debate upon the different definitions of &#34; Socialism.&#34; In the meantime. I wish to sav that if I can help the individual enterprise of the  producers of Australia by the use of the powers of the Legislature, I shall be most happy to do so. I stop short of abolishing the enterprise of individuals, and converting their industries into Government factories. However, I hope that the inflammable season will not set in in connexion with this useful measure. I should like also to say that although we have already given a week to the honorable member for Eden-Monaro in connexion with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, we are very anxious to afford him a further opportunity to deal with that measure. </para>

            <para>- If my honorable friend could only speak as well as he can interrupt, he would be a statesman. There is another subject, upon the importance of which we all agree, although widely different views are taken in this Chamber in reference to it, that is, preferential tradeAs I have said, we do not at all propose to accept the honorable member for Hume as a leader upon that great subject. We think that the natural leader of the movement in Australia in favour of preferential trade is the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and as we have said, we proposeto give him an opportunity of introducing that subject. We have, the less difficulty in doing that, because there is no doubt whatever that the subject was thoroughly canvassed at the last general election, and is, therefore, one upon which the House may be fairly invited to express its opinion. I think honorable members will agree with me, however, that it is one upon which a very lengthy debate must take place. </para>

            <para>- It would be very difficult to decide where I am residing at the present time. I think that there is a matter even&#39; more important than the question of our getting into recess. With all our anxiety to conclude the work of the session, we ought to have some regard to the amount of work of an urgent character that is to be transacted, and, so far as I am concerned, T am prepared to suffer all the inconveni  ence  involved in staying in Melbourne a little longer if we can pass a few of the more urgent measures that are awaiting our decision. The suggested programme for the balance of the session put forward by the Prime Minister, does not seem to me to be quite complete. So far as the Estimates are concerned, I do not anticipate that any great length of time will be consumed in their discussion. No doubt there are some items to which exception will be taken, but I can assure the Prime Minister that there will be nothing like obstruction. There remains then the Papua Bill, which, as the Prime Minister has said, is nearly complete, and can be disposed of, I think, in a portion of an evening. I know that upon one. question some difficulty may arise, but even with regard to that I do not think that any lengthy discussion will ensue. The Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Survey Bill has been almost disposed of, so far as this House is concerned, and will not take up much more .of our time. With regard to the proposed amendment of the Defence Act, if the course proposed by the Minister is that which we have reason to anticipate from something that was published in this morning&#39;s newspapers- </para>

            <para>- But we can go a long way in that direction. I quite agree with the honorable member for Wide Bay that it is a pity the Federal authority is not clothed with greater powers in this regard ; but as far as our powers allow us to act. I think that Bill is of a verv important character. Then again, the Bills of Lading Bill is a measure which the Opposition can welcome. It is quite in consonance with the policy of the party upon this side of the House that the operations of the producers of the community should be facilitated to the utmost extent, consistently of course with a due regard for justice to other people. So far as I am able to glean, there is an urgent necessity for some reform in that direction in the interests of our producers. We have been informed by the Prime Minister that further time will be afforded for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. So far as I am concerned, there is one omission from the statement of the Prime Minister which is even more important than is even that measure. I refer to the Trade Marks Bill. </para>

            <para>- I have been informed by some senators that the other Chamber is practically agreed upon that Bill. I urge that there is a grave necessity for the passing of a measure of that description. All the machinery necessary for its working is already in. existence. Its passage will involve no greater expenditure than is involved to-day in the working of the Patents Act, and in the absence of a Federal Trade Marks Act, a state of things which is altogether inconsistent with the Federal idea will be perpetuated. That is a very undesirable condition of affairs. To-day it is impossible for a man by one registration to secure protection for a trade mark throughout Australia. Further, it is possible - as it was in pre-Federal times - to register the same trade mark in different States on behalf of different persons. That practice has a very confusing effect upon the transport of manufactured goods from one State to another. It is a Bill upon which no great controversy can arise. T notice that some objection has been taken to one feature of that Bill, but only to one feature, and a vote of this House could decide its acquiescence or otherwise in that principle. The objection on the part of some persons to a provision which was recently inserted in that Bill by the Senate, does not seem to me a sufficient cause for delaying its passage. It is a measure of a non-controversial character- </para>

        <para>Some time ago I expressed surprise that the previous Ministry had not seen its way to submit the two measures simultaneously, and to pass them almost concurrently, because the one is merely the complement of the other. I think that the Government will be well advised if they make an effort to pass that measure in the interests of the commercial community, and I can assure them that I will use my best endeavours to limit the discussion upon it in every possible way, so as to secure its earlypassage through the House. </para>

            <para>- That is so. Those honorable members who are associated with me will not hamper its passing on that account. We entertain certain opinions, b&#34;.t expression can be given to them without delaying the taking of a vote. So far as the other matter mentioned by the Prime Minister is concerned, I must express regret that the Government cannot see their way clear to allow the House an opportunity to express its opinion upon the question of preferential trade during this session. It is true that the matter was put before the electors upon the occasion of the appeal to them in December last, and for a considerable  time I was of opinion that there was no necessity to take further action owing to the fact that a clear expression of their views had then been obtained. But since I formed that, view it has been shown that a considerable difference of opinion exists in the motherland as to the desire of Australia in this connexion. In the interests of those who are engaged  in  the controversy  in  England - irrespective of the side which they may take - I think it is desirable that this confusion should be cleared up at the earliest possible moment. If it is a fact that the people of Australia do not desire to enter into a scheme of preferential trade, the sooner that view is expressed- </para>

            <para>- If the honorable member will permit me to get a word in edgeways, it may result in saving the time of this House. I know of nothing in the pledges of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat which will preclude him from asking for an early expression of opinion from honorable members of this Chamber, and from the other branch of the Legislature, upon this most important question. As the honorable member for Hume has been referred to by the Prime Minister, I may mention that he intimated to me that he has no wish to take this question out of the hands of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. It was because no action was being taken upon a matter which was very dear to him that he placed his motion relating to it upon the business-paper. The Prime Minister has since indicated that it would be regarded as a motion of no confidence, but I can assure him that it was not put forward with any such view, but merely with the idea of securing an expression of opinion upon the question at the earliest possible moment. I trust that the Prime Minister will see the necessity of giving some consideration to the Trade Marks Bill and the important question of preferential trade before the session closes. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLEAN</inline>(Gippsland - Minister of Trade and Customs). - I hope that the honorable member for Boothby, who submitted this motion, will consent to allow it to stand1 over for the present. From what I have been able to ascertain, I think that it will be found quite possible to obtain through the Department all the information which the honorable member requires. Even if we cannot obtain all the information, we shall be able to secure sufficient to enable us to see whether there is a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case for the appointment of a Royal Commission. I do not think that we should hastily appoint a Commission which would involve considerable cost, unless we knew that the information we desired to obtain could not be secured by other means. </para>

        <para>The remarks made by the honorable the Minister of Trade and Customs on the proposal to create a Royal Commission to investigate the present condition of the tobacco trade lead us to believe that your Government are reluctant to appoint such a Commission. We, therefore, venture to point out to you that we are entitled to claim public investigation as an act of justice to ourselves. Statements have been made, both inside and outside of Parliament, by gentlemen holding high positions, with regard vo our actions and those of firms connected with us, which statements are as incorrect. as they are injurious to us. We beg respectfully to state that, in common fairness, we should be given an opportunity of refuting these statements before a body authorized to investigate them, such as this Royal Commission would be. We would, therefore, beg of you to accede to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> that such a Royal Commission be created, in which case we will, of course, most willingly place at its disposal the most, ample and candid information which the public interest may require. </para>

          <para>- I recognise that the change in events since this motion was put on the notice-paper has so completely altered the position of affairs as to almost warrant its withdrawal. But I should like to say under cover of it that, to my mind, preferential trade might, while helping Great Britain, be used to assist our own manufactures also, and the postponement of a decision in regard to the matter until next session is very disappointing. I had hoped, not only that opportunity would be given for its discussion, but that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat would have embodied some proposals in a short Bill, which would have enabled us to do in regard to Great Britain what has been done by Canada and by New Zealand, and also to assist our own struggling industries. </para>

            <para>- She has increased some, and has lowered others. I am aware, however, that I cannot discuss the subject of preferential trade on this motion, and I recognise that it would be a waste of time to debate the question of Tariff readjustment at the present juncture. I hope that the Government will carry out their promise to appoint a Royal Commission as soon as possible, and that when the recommendations of that Commission are presented, action will be taken upon them to relieve our struggling industries. As these steps have already been promised for the readjustment of the Tariff, I move - </para>

          <para>- The other day I asked the Prime Minister whether a certain statement which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper was correct. That statement had reference to the number of persons who are said to be off the rolls, and was in the form of an interview with the right honorable gentleman on the subject. It appeared to me, on reading that interview, that the Prime Minister sought to excuse the Government for not going to the country at the present time, because of the fact that there are between 300,000 and 400,000 qualified electors whose names are not on the roll, and who consequently would not now be able to vote. </para>

Attention has already been called by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and by the honorable member for Coolgardie, to the evasive manner in which questions asked by honorable members are answered by Ministers.

            <para>- -But even if a man changed his address he would be able to vote just the same. He could, if necessary, make use of a Q form. It appeared to me that a statement such as that made by the Prime Minister would certainly have a misleading, effect upon the public, and that it ought to be corrected at the earliest possible opportunity. Further than that, I considered that if such a large number of persons were disfranchised some further investigation should be made into the Electoral Department, and that the whole of the officers should be removed as speedily as possible. Nearly twelve months have elapsed since the last election, and now we are led to suppose that the rolls are in such a state that in the event of another election between 300.000 and 400,000  persons would be unable to vote. That would be a very serious state of affairs. Suppose that instead of securing a narrow and questionable majority., the Government had been defeated upon the recent want of confidence motion ? We should not have been in a position to carry on the business of the country, and our Electoral Department would have been so paralvzed that no election could have taken place. The sooner some alteration is made in the method of compiling the rolls the better. In my opinion the Electoral Department should be placed under the administration of a commissioner, who would be beyond the control of the Government. </para>

            <para>- Parliament has no right to be dependent upon the action of the Government in a matter of that. kind. We are elected directly by the people, and, therefore, anything connected with the compilation of the rolls, upon which the exercise of the franchise largely depends, should be placed entirely beyond the control of the Government. If we placed the Electoral Department under the control of a commissioner we should be able to hold him responsible for effective administration in the same way that we look to the AuditorGeneral to see that our financial affairs are properly ordered. The commissioner would be in a position to keep the rolls right up to date, and if he failed in that respect we should soon require to know the reason why. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is the only cause of the trouble. The present system of collecting the rolls by employing the police is a very good one. There is no doubt that at the last election some confusion arose through the Department being called upon to conduct an election earlier than had been expected. The present system of collecting the rolls might be continued, but everything must not be left until the last moment. At the earliest possible moment the Government should make arrangements for the holding of Revision Courts at stated intervals If the electors were encouraged to come forward at certain stated times they would render valuable assistance to the Electoral Department in making the rolls complete. At present honorable members are continually receiving letters from persons who desire to have their names placed upon the rolls, asking when Revision Courts are to be held and what steps they are to take. There appears to be no uniform system at present. </para>

My principle object in rising was to refer to the statement of the Prime Minister that between 300,000 and 400.000 persons would be disfranchised if an election took place at the present stage. Since the right honorable gentleman has stated that he did not wish to convey that meaning. I do not desire to press the matter anyfurther. I hope that steps will be taken by the Government to make the rolls complete at the verv earliestpossible date. </para>

I have just seen the honorable member, who is confined to his bed by severe illness, and he desires that his notice of motion may remain upon the notice-paper, so that he may deal with it three weeks hence. As the honorable member for Hume has exhibited so much interest in this particular matter, it seems to me that it would not be a proper thing for any other honorable member to attempt to take the leadership in regard to it out of his hands. Under the circumstances, and in view of his illness, I would ask the House to allow the motion which appears upon the business-paper to be dealt with upon next grievance day. </para>

I am not one who is given to shirking his duty in the way that some Ministers are doing. Some time ago, a very plain question was placed upon the business-paper by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, touching a preference which had been granted by the Postmaster-General to certain tenderers for postal supplies.

If the Prime Minister regards that as offensive, under your instructions, sir, I shall withdraw the remark, while retaining my own opinion in regard to it. The question put by the honorable and learned member for Parkes was very clear and explicit, and was not answered in any way by the reply which had previously been given to another honorable member. The honorable and learned member for Parkes naturally resented this attempt to evade a clear issue, and placed the question a second time upon the businesspaper.

        <para class="block">That was not an answer to the question at all. The question asked was whether any legislative authority existed for the action of the Postmaster-General, and coald not be answered by a quibble to the effect that there is no legislation against the practice. The practice condemned by the honorable and learned member for Parkes is the rejection of a lower tender and the acceptance of a higher one. The Prime Minister stated that he knows of no legislation which interferes with the course that the Government propose to follow, whereas the right honorable gentleman was asked whether any constitutional or legislative authority existed for his action. In other words, he has the effrontery to tell this House that he knows of no legislative authority which restrains him from paying more for Government supplies than is necessary to pay. </para>

            <para>- I trust that some honorable member&#34; will move for the production of all papers relating to this matter. It is a most remarkable coincidence that upon the accession of this Government to office the move which I have indicated was made on behalf of the two Melbourne morning newspapers. Ample proof of my statement is to be found in the provincial journals, but I will just read to the House an extract from a newspaper which is published in this city. It is as follows: - </para>

          <para>The general public is in no very pleasant mood with the Postmaster-General&#39;s action in the postal pillar scandal. The conveniences of the general public have been set aside to assist the two morning newspapers in their petty grasping efforts to sell a few more papers at Ballarat and Bendigo. The Railway Department is supplying special trains for an additional payment of &#163;1,500 per annum, which would, under ordinary commercial conditions, cost nearly &#163;40,000 a year, and the postal arrangements are not only disarranged, but turned topsy-turvy to make it appear that a public convenience is being served by the newspaper specials. </para>

My criticism of Ministers was always severe, when I felt it to be deserved, and I shall not hesitate to freely criticise their actions whenever I think that it is necessary to do so. I always endeavour, however, to be fair, and I hope that the PostmasterGeneral can say as much for himself. We are entitled to know why a large section of the people of Melbourne are inconvenienced by the new arrangement to which I have referred. It is not in force in any other State capital, and apparently it was introduced to increase the monopoly which the two morning newspapers published in Melbourne already enjoyed in this State. I do not wish to detain the House further, but I give notice of my intention to take some action in regard to this matter. </para>

          <para>-I desire to refer briefly to the matter of the compilation of the rolls, which was introduced by the honorable member for Kennedy. In answer to a question I put this afternoon to the Minister of Home Affairs, a statement was made by the honorable gentleman, which seems to me to supply a reason for the absence of the names of so many persons from the rolls. I do not say that as many names have been left off as the Prime Minister has suggested. I think that he was inclined to exaggerate the number, but it cannot be denied that the names of a great many persons have been left off, because of the instructions issued to. the collectors by the Electoral Office. According to the Minister&#39;s answer, the collectors have been instructed that care must be exercised that no persons temporarily resident in any locality are placed upon the rolls. I should like to know where authority is found for such an instruction. The Electoral Act certainly supplies none. Section 31 of the Act provides that - </para>

There are a number of nien, such as miners and harvesters, who go from place to place throughout the Commonwealth, and I hold that those engaged in collecting the rolls have no right to put any questions to them whatever in regard to this matter. If a man expresses a desire to have his name placed on the rolls he has a right to expect that desire to be complied with, no matter where he may be residing for the time being, and I hold that it is not within the province of the Electoral Office to issue such an instruction as that to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>- I wish to deal with a matter arising out of certain remarks made by me in the course of the debate on the motion of censure which recently engaged the attention of the House. On that occasion I made a quotation from a newspaper report of an address by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stinson,</inline> the  president  of the People&#39;s Reform League, and it is to that matter that I desire specially to refer. During my visit to Sydney last week I met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stinson,</inline> and since my return to Melbourne have received a communication from him bearing upon this subject. I gathered as the result of my conversation with him that, whilst he did not take exception, on the score of want of accuracy, to the quotation in question, he considered that it might be misconstrued, and as I do not wish it to be said that any portion of my remarks were unfair or unwarranted, I take this opportunity to place before the House the full facts in relation to the matter. The remarks in question dealt with the opposition to the Labour Party on the ground that they are socialistically inclined, andin this connexion I was referring, not to the Reform League, but to a new association which is being largely supported by the Prime Minister and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and is known as the Farmers&#39;, Property Owners&#39;, and Producers&#39; Association. The first plank of the platform of that Association provides for the complete sinking of the fiscal issue, which divides the free-traders and protectionists, making the battle-cry in the future opposition to Socialism, and particularly to the Labour Party. I should like to read the official report of my remarks, which is to be found on pages 5 191 and 5192 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They were as follows :  - </para>

I do not know what newspaper report you quoted from, but if you had quoted the whole sentence instead of a portion, you could not possibly have put upon it the construction you did. Let me supply the balance omitted by you, following on the word &#34; principal,&#34; where you left off - &#34;And whilst probably all these causes contribute in part to the general result, the primary cause is, in my opinion, the lack  of information and of a knowledge of theprinciples of government on the part of the electors themselves.&#34; </para>
        <para>My whole paper was in advocacy of a wider education for the people, not for a curtailment of  their rights or privileges. For your fuller information, I send a copy of the paper, of which I invite your perusal. </para>
        <para>In justice to the People&#39;s Reform League (as president of which I read the paper), I think you will see the propriety of publicly and suitably acknowledging the false impression your quotation would be likely fo convey. </para>

          <para>-  I understand that the police were instructed, in collecting the Federal rolls, to group the names of the electors according to their proximity to the polling places. That may be a good arrangement in some localities, but in a densely populated electorate such as mine it may prove unworkable. For instance, in one subdivision of my electorate there are over 6,000 electors enrolled, but if all the names are grouped according to proximity to a polling place, about 9,000 persons will have to vote in one building, and there is no building in the division large enough to accommodate so many. I think that the old divisional boundaries which have existed for years should not, without good reason, be disturbed. It may be advisable in country electorates to alter the grouping of names, but in metropolitan and suburban electorates, where people remain, for the most part, in the same place year after year, it is not advisable to make a change, and I trust that the Minister will see that no alteration is made that is not absolutely necessary, and has not been asked for by the electors. I brought the matter under the notice of the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian</inline> Commonwealth Electoral Officer, but as I did not hear anything more about it I thought it well to call the attention of the Minister to it. </para>

          <para>- I desire to say a few words with regard to the electoral rolls. In the first instance, the period which has been mentioned as necessary to allow of the rolls being brought up to date, seems to me to be an unwarrantably long one. I think that the Electoral Department ought to find it possible to complete the rolls in a much shorter period. The statement of the Prime Minister as to the number of. persons whose names are wrongly on the rolls of New South Wales and Victoria, amounting to 400,000, would convey to the ordinary man a very wrong impression. So far &#39; as I have been, able to ascertain, a number of people have left their previous residences since the rolls were collected, and corrections require to be made, but in the great majority of instances these persons have not removed beyond the electtorate for which they are enrolled, and are still eligible to vote. </para>

            <para>- That mav be so, but a still larger proportion have not done so. If the Electoral Department wished to convey a proper impression, they would furnish the number of persons who have removed beyond the electorates for which they are enrolled, and who would require to obtain transfers to other rolls. The proportion of those who have moved so far is not very large. </para>

        <para>Mr.W AT SON. - That may be an exceptional case. In the countrv electorates many men move about within the boundaries of an electorate, and, therefore, are not disfranchised by a change of address. I admit that occasionally thev move beyond the electorate, but I should think that 30,000 or 40,000 would probably cover those electors who would be disfranchised if an election were to take place to-morrow, and they had no opportunitv to become enrolled. The impression sought to be created by the Prime Minister was that it would be impossible to hold an election now, because of the condition of the rolls. I. contend that that is absolute nonsense. It would be of advantage if the rolls could be brought up to date, but at any period at which an election might be held, the rolls would contain the names of a large number of persons whose addresses were wrongly given, or who had moved away from their original places of residence. The rolls are incorrect in a certain degree, in regard to the descriptions of the electors, butin most cases Brown or Jones would be still eligible to vote. With regard to those electors who had moved out of a district, the roll, at the worst, would be surplusage. </para>

            <para>- There may be some room for complaint in that regard, but at the worst the inaccuracies on the rolls are merely surplusage. If the writs for an election were issued within a month of the present time, an opportunity would be given to every person to enrol prior to the election taking place. The Prime Minister has sought to create the impression, or has allowed it to be created, that it would be impossible to hold an election now, owing to the condition of the rolls. </para>

          <para>- A somewhat serious condition of affairs is disclosed by the statement of the Prime Minister, according to whom we cannot at any time expect to obtain a reasonably correct roll. A collection of names was made bv the police and postal officials at the end of last November, which was supposed, to be up to date, and yet when the police went round at the beginning of last July, there were from 300.000 to 400,000 inaccuracies. Therefore, we can assume that when the rolls are brought up to date within the next two or three months they will still be faulty. As the Minister of Home Affairs is aware, the police began to collect the rolls on the 1 st July. I understand from him that five more weeks will elapse before that work will have been completed. </para>

In New South Wales &#39;the police commenced to collect the rolls on the 1st July; but the lists would not be printed and revision Courts held for some weeks yet. </para>

            <para>- The work of completing the rolls, and of bringing them up to date, will occupy until the end of December of the present year. It has already been shown that after nine months had been devoted to their preparation, they contained from 300,000 to 400,000 inaccuracies. If that is the normal condition of things, it is evident that we shall never get the rolls in anything like an accurate state. </para>

            <para>- Possibly it is twelve months. The work of collecting the rolls usually occupies from seven to eight months, because the States do not undertake the work simultaneously. The Watson Administration were induced to request the States Governments to commence the collection of the rolls in July by the knowledge that at that period some of the States were engaged in collecting statistics. To ray mind it is obvious that an earnest attempt will have to be made to expedite the collection of the rolls by the police, otherwise they will never be in a proper condition. </para>

            <para>- I notice that the right honorable member for Swan is now present in the Chamber. Some time ago I asked the Minister of Home Affairs whether he was aware that when the right honorable member retired from office there were no rolls - either old or new - available for the conduct of an election. The right honorable member thereupon interjected that my statement was absurd! The fact is that he did not carefully listen to my statement. It is absolutely true that there were not sufficient rolls in Western Australia to supply the needs of the police in the compilation of fresh rolls. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable member will see that there was no need for him to get into such an excited state of mind as he did upon a former occasion. The charge of inaccuracy which he levelled against me was absolutely unjustifiable. I have no wish to occupy any more time upon this matter. It is evident that we must reconcile ourselves to a condition of things under which at no particular period can the rolls be regarded as perfectly accurate, because of the shifting of population, and the fact that electors will not take the trouble to get .their names transferred. In order .that we may have a fairly full roll, I am of opinion that it will be necessary to provide for frequent collections - probably one each year  -  by the police and postal officials. </para>

          <para class="block">My attention was drawn to that section by the honorable member for Bland. According to its provisions, we must either take over the whole of the States debts, or a proportion, <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> That, however, . does not deter me from saying that whilst it is advisable to take over the States debts as they existed at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth, no advantage is likely to be derived from interfering with the loans until they are nearing maturity. Last evening, the honorable and learned .member for Parkes asked, by way of interjection, whether it would not be possible for the Commonwealth to buy up the stock on the London market whenever the opportunity offered. I do not think that any plan of that sort would be effective, because people are usually very much alive to their own interests, and our bond-holders would see that they obtained as good value as possible for their bonds. But, in addition to that, the Commonwealth does not possess the necessary funds to permit of the adoption of that course, and, therefore,, it would necessarily be required to raise loans upon existing market conditions. I take it, therefore, that the proposal of the honorable and learned member is scarcely a practicable one. </para>

Loans would require to be raised for the purpose of paying off those maturing, and bond-holders would be given an opportunity of taking up a &#39; part of the new issue. That is the way in which conversions are usually carried out. An idea seems to prevail in this House, and it has been put forward in some papers presented to this House - especially in a memorandum which was submitted to the Treasurers&#39; Conference by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Holder - that if the Commonwealth took over the public debts of the States, and gave the bond-holders the advantage of Commonwealth security, we should be making -a free gift to the bondholders of an increased value, which should properly belong to the Commonwealth. It has been urged that that increased value should not go to enrich those who hold our bonds. I entertain no such opinion, because any country must be benefited by its bonds standing high in the money market. The higher they stand the better. If by some stroke of good fortune to the </para>

Would any one begrudge the bond-holders the increased value of their stocks? I think not We must remember that many of the bonds which are at present selling for&#163;84, atone time cost &#163;100. I know of some Western Australian 3 per cent, bonds, for which&#163;100 was paid, but which are now selling at the price I have just mentioned, yet no one appears to be ready to commiserate with the holders on the loss of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;16</inline> per <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> which they have sustained. </para>

              <para>- Of course not; but in all these matters we have to consider the marketable value of the bonds. It is no satisfaction to a bond-holder to be told that if he will only wait he will receive &#163;100 in respect of every &#163;100 bond possessed by him. I take it that an increase in the value of the stock of any country is to the advantage of that country. We are not to allow our opinions to be swayed by the feeling that if we converted any portion of the loans of the States we might confer a benefit on some private individual. We could not take that point into consideration unless it were possible for us in any proper way to participate in the advantage so secured, and we may depend upon it, that if we seek to convert before the date of maturity our bond-holders will endeavour to extract from us the full value of their stocks. For this reason I do not think that there is very much hope of our gaining anything, by converting loans until tbey are nearing maturity, and I do not recommend that we should attempt to do so at the present time. The memorandum placed before the Conference of Treasurers by the Federal Treasurer, and subsequently laid on the table of this House, affords us very clear and full information as to all the loans of the States that were outstanding at the date of its preparation. Under section 105 of the Constitution, we can take over only the loans which existed at the date of Federation, and these amount to &#163;203,978,482. Honorable members are  aware that since the establishment of the Commonwealth, further loans, representing a considerable sum have been raised by the several States; but under the Constitution we cannot deal with those loans, unless they were floated for the conversion of any loan existing at the date of Federation. </para>

              <para>- Quite so, but I refer to any loans that may be raised at a future date, for the purpose of converting loans, which under the Constitution mav be taken over by us. It is only reasonable that such loans should be included in the public debts of the States to be taken over by the Commonwealth. The annual interest on that portion of the public debt of Australia, which existed at the date of the establishment of Federation, amounts to &#163;7,290, 190. Under the Constitution, during the bookkeeping period of five years, we have to return to each State the balance between the Commonwealth expenditure in that State, and the amount of revenue produced in it through the Customs and other Federal sources, and this year it is estimated that the Treasurer will return to the whole of the States a sum of &#163;7,138,986. It will be seen that the estimated amount to be returned this year is almost equal to the interest due on the debt which we are empowered to take over. </para>

              <para>- That phase of the question requires, of course, careful consideration, and increases the difficulty. The point I wish to make is that under our powers of taxation we have sufficient security to justify us in taking over the public debts of the States. Our powers of taxation by way of Customs and Excise duties have not been exhausted. Items remain untouched which would produce a considerable amount of revenue, and which in times of stress ordifficulty would have to be drawn upon. For this reason I have not been able to understand why the Treasurer should have demanded so much&#39; security from the States ; I do not know why he should have asked that the whole of the railway revenue of the States should pass through his hands in order that he might retain any sum required by him to meet expenditure on account of the redemption of the public debts taken over by the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- There is such a thing as desiring to be a little too safe. A man who always seeks to be on the safe side will endeavour, as a rule, to get the better of the party with whom he is negotiating, instead of being as generous to him as he would have him be to himself. The loans which mature during the next ten years amount to about ^44,000,000, and that is not a very large proportion of the total of ^203, 978,482 with which we have to deal. I would advise that, in taking over the responsibility for these debts, we should deal only with the&#39; loans as they mature, and that we should adopt a system of interminable bonds, with power for the Commonwealth to repay at any time, after a certain number of years have elapsed, on due notice being given. If we did that we should place ourselves in the position now occupied by some of the States. I am glad to say that Western Australia has this power at the present time. The loans of that State have a currency of forty years, and the Government have&#34;&#34; the right to give twelve months&#39; notice of intention to repay at any time after the lapse of twenty years. In that way the State Government have been placed in an excellent position, because it is open to them to choose their own time to repay. </para>

              <para>- My reason for addressing myself to this question is that it is one of great and most pressing importance. It will be necessary for us to take immediate action before very long. We have a duty cast upon us under the Constitution, and it is not as some persons imagine purely a matter in which the States may take action. We have the power to take over the debts of the States existing on the establishment of Federation without obtaining, their consent. The Constitution provides that &#34; the Parliament may take over from the States their public debts.&#34; That is to say, we can take them over <inline font-style="italic">nolens volens.</inline> We should not. of course, -desire to do anything of the kind. It would be our wish to work in harmony with the States, but it is clear that the intention of the Constitution is that these debts should be taken over by the Commonwealth. I find from the excellent memorandum prepared on this subject by the Treasurer, that over .&#163;3,000,000 worth of stock falls due next year, and will have to be met by the States concerned, unless we can come to an agreement for the taking over of the public debts of the States under the provisions of the Constitution. During the next five years - 1905 to 1909- a sum of &#163;20,000.000 will fall due, including the &#163;3,000,000 to which I have just referred. During the next five years - between 1910 and 1914, ,&#163;24,000,000 more will fall due, while ,&#163;51, 000.000 will fall due between 1 9 r 5 and 1 919 ; &#163;5 1 ,000,000 between 1920 and 1924; and &#163;60.000,000 between 1925 and 1929, and the balance at a later date. The pressure begins next year, when &#163;3,000,000 falls due, and the pressure will continue for the next twenty-five years. I hope that the Government will be able, to take the matter in hand very soon, and that next session a proposition for taking over the whole-of the debts of the States will be laid before ,us. I anticipate the success of the scheme probably with more confidence than does the Treasurer, who, of course, has the greater responsibility. At the same time, I believe that there is no need to show any want of confidence in the States by asking them for more security than, we require, since we have almost enough at the present time, and. our latent powers are sufficient to allow us to provide the money ourselves if the States do not fulfil their obligations. </para>

              <para>- I know that there are difficulties in the way of extending the operation of the Braddon provision, because so long as at has force, the Federal Parliament will not have the freedom of expenditure which it would otherwise have. But necessity knows no law, and therefore I am of opinion that it would be wise to extend the operation of the Braddon provision for some years. The varying conditions of the States would create serious difficulty if any <inline font-style="italic">per capital</inline> distribution of the surplus revenue were adopted. I am aware that the honorable member for Mernda has a plan for overcoming the difficulty. I have not examined it but I have tried my best to discover how the difficulty can be overcome, except by the present bookkeeping mode, but up to the present have- not been successful. I know of no way by which full justice can be done to the States by any mode of distribution other than that vh Ch 1 is carried out under the bookkeeping and Braddon clause provisions. I do not bind myself to the exact terms of that provision ; but unless some plan can be devised for returning to each State the revenue it raises, less the Fe- deral expenditure, great dissatisfaction must be caused, since the citizens of the States have not yet sufficient of the Federal spirit to be willing to pay money for the assistance of other States, unless for some very specific and well-defined object. The ingenuity of the Treasurer, however may discover some means whereby, while dispensing with the Braddon and bookkeeping provisions of the Constitution, full justice may be done to all the States. </para>

              <para>- Then perhaps the honorable member will devise some scientific way of getting rid of the difficulty. I find by the papers which have been placed before us, that the amount paid for sugar bounties this year will be &#163;104,162, and that., we have already paid &#163;252,000 These payments are made to encourage the production of sugar cane by white instead of by coloured labour, and to recompense the employers of white labour for the greater expense which they have to incur. Up to the present time the Queensland growers have received &#163;138,000, and the New South Wales growers &#163;114,000. This latte, amount may be regarded as practically a present to the growers, because very little black labour has ever been employed in New South Wales. The Sugar Bounties Act will, however, expire on the 1st January, 1907, and then there will probably be a demand for its re-enactment for a term. Prior to the imposition of the Federal Tariff, the- people of the State of Western Australia had admitted for years past both tea and sugar free of dutv, but now they are not only paying a duty upon sugar, but are contributing towards the bounties given to the growers in New South Wales and Queensland. </para>

A State which raises u revenue of &#163;3,500,000 from a population of 240,000, cannot be said not to raise sufficient revenue. If the amount raised is not enough, the remedy should lie in reducing expenditure. </para>

              <para>- That is a very large amount ; but I am not finding fault with it. The honorable member for Wentworth seems to think that when one makes observations of this kind he is begrudging the money, but no such idea has entered my mind. We knew what we were doing when we consented, to grant the bounties, and we shall have to keep the compact. If we wish to encourage white men to grow sugar we shall have to pay for it&#39;; that was thoroughly understood at the time. Therefore, any remarks I am making are not by way of complaint.. What I desire to point out, however, is that the other States are required to make a very large contribution towards the sugar bounties. The State which I represent has always met with generous treatment at the hands of New South Wales, but I desire lo point out to the representatives of Queensland that Western Australia - that far-off country of which people know so little - has already paid the sugar-growers ;&#163;x5&#62;394&#187; and that her contribution by 1907 will probably amount to ,&#163;50,000. </para>

              <para>- The Treasury of New South Wales has benefited by the Federal Tariff to a much larger extent than has the Treasury of any other State. Owing to the operation of the Federal Tariff, it has received &#163;5,003,289 in excess of the revenue he would have derived under the duties in operation prior to the introduction of the Federal Tariff. The people ofNew South Wales have had to contribute that revenue themselves, in the same way that the people of Western Australia have paid the duties imposed upon them by the special Tariff. I can see no point in the reiteration of the remarks which have been made with regard to the Western Australian special Tariff, apparently on the presumption that it has inflicted some injury upon the other States. </para>

              <para>- The sugar bounties do not seem to have had that stimulating effect upon the production of sugar by white labour that we all desired to see. In 1903, 24,406 tons of sugar were produced by white labour in&#39; Queensland, whilst the production for the present year is estimated to reach 31,190 tons - an increase of only 7,284 tons. In regard to that production a bonus of &#163;62,800 has to be paid. I do not think that that is a satisfactory state of affairs. The production of white-grown sugar was practically doubled between 1902 and 1903 ; but the increase for the current year is a comparatively small one. In New South Wales the position is still worse, because the production of sugar in 1903 was 19,236 tons, and for 1904 18,600 tons, or a decrease of 636 tons. For this production we have to pay a bonus of , &#163;37,200. </para>

              <para>- I do not desire to say one word against the policy we adopted. I am simply studying the effects of the bounties,with a view to arrive at some explanation. Although we are paying bounties amounting to &#163;100,000 for the encouragement of the production of sugar by white men, the net increase in the production for the current year is estimated at only 6,648 tons. I commend this matter to the attention of the Treasurer.We find that the sugar grown by black labour in Queensland last year was 65,456 tons, whereas for the present year the yield is estimated at 97,810 tons, or an increase of 32,354 tons. In New South Wales the production of sugar grown by black labour last year was 2,561 tons, and during the present year the estimate is 2,000 tons, or a decrease of 561 tons. This tends to show that there is less black labour being employed there. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking of the actual production. I do not know that I need &#34;delay the Committee any longer. I hope that we shall soon dispose of the Estimates. Three Governments have had a hand in them. The Deakin Government had them about ready when they left office in April last. Then the Watson Government came into power, and the honorable member for Bland had the Estimates ready to present to honorable members about the time he left office. I am glad to see the present Treasurer back in his old position. I am sure that he did not find it necessary to make many alterations in the Estimates which he left behind him when he resigned office. There is nothing new nor startling in the Estimates. It will puzzle any honorable member - even if he studies them from beginning to end - to discover any item with which he can find much fault. They have been framed with too much care to permit of our criticising them in Committee, except with a view to elicit information, and to give the Treasurer the . benefit of any suggestions which may occur to us. I trust that the Estimates will be quickly disposed of, and - seeing that Parliament has been sitting almost continuously for three years, thereby rendering honorable members who occupy a similar position to myself almost strangers to their own homes - that we shall have an opportunity of visiting our respective States at the earliest possible moment. </para>

In referring to the Defence Estimates, I wish to say that the condition of affairs in the Far East surely demands that the Government, and the Minister of Defence in particular, should give the matter of our coastal defences very serious consideration. I regard Thursday Island and Albany as the two eyes of our Continent. I search these Estimates vainly in an attempt to find adequate provision made for necessary expenditure at the points I have indicated in connexion with our naval defence. I was one wHo strongly supported the proposal to contribute to the maintenance of an Imperial fleet in Australian waters to insure us adequate protection from a foreign foe. At no time, however, did I entertain the opinion that we should be doing justice to our own people if we neglected our coastal and harbor defences. I earnestly hope that the Minister, who possesses such a practical knowledge of the subject, will see that proper provision is made in this connexion. </para>

Notwithstanding that a considerable sum has been placed upon the Estimates for the purchase of a supply of magazine Lee-Enfield rifles, I trust that he will not rest content until every member of a rifle club has been provided with one of these weapons. </para>

              <para>- Of course I recognise that our first line of defence must be properly equipped&#39;. I now. wish to refer to another matter of importance, namely, the cadet movement. I know that the Minister is entirely in sympathy with that movement, and thathe is now placing himself in communication with the various States upon the subject. I am in strong agreement with one plank in the platform of my honorable friends opposite, in that I believe we must ultimately rely for our defence upon the individual knowledge and capacity of our citizens. If, then, we instruct our public school boys in the rudiments of military drill,&#39; so that they may subsequently be enabled to join the rifle clubs, and eventually to take their places in the militia forces of the Commonwealth, I think that we shall be doing all that we possibly can in the direction of our own defence. I have no desire to take up an unreasonable position, but next session - when I hope the Minister of Defence will be more firmly established in his office than he is to-day - I trust that he will submit a comprehensive and definite scheme in connexion with our cadet system. I come now to a question with which the right honorable member for Swan dealt very exhaustively - the consolidation and transfer of the States debts. Unfortunately for us, the Commonwealth Parliament has not acted in such a way as to justify the people of the States in reposing unbounded confidence in it. </para>

              <para>- I can assure my honorable friend that it is not ridiculous. I am merely stating facts of which I have a personal knowledge. Anybody who peruses the report of the proceedings of the Treasurers&#39; Conference must &#34;be struck with the obvious fact that the States Treasurers attended with a fixed resolve not to surrender to the Commonwealth anything in the nature of securities if they could possibly avoid it. I do not entertain the same hopeful view as does the Treasurer concerning the outcome of the next Conference. Should his anticipations prove correct, I shall be delighted. When the Conference takes place I think it will be found that the States Treasurers are more determined than ever not to transfer further responsibilities to the control of the Commonwealth. I am glad that the Conference is to meet as early as February next, and I shall watch its proceedings with very great interest. The right honorable member for Swan has clearly shown that the conversion of loans representing so large a sum as &#163;220,000,000 must be a gradual process, and that is a point which I desire to emphasize. I do not think there is any inducement, nor is there likely to be any, for our doing anything to anticipate the maturing of these debts. My own impression is that the operation of converting them will not prove one of those financial projects that may be accomplished in the course of a few months, or even years. There will be a gradual process of evolution, and it will be necessary for us, as each loan is maturing, to take into careful consideration all the features which the money market of the day presents. </para>

              <para>- That could not be done. The honorable member recognises, of course, that it would not be an easy matter to convert at one operation loans amounting to no less a sum than &#163;220,000,000. One may be disposed at first to consider that there are not many difficulties in the way,&#34; but as soon as he gives serious attention to the matter he must recognise that the task before us is one of great magnitude. I should like to bear tribute to the excellent compilation forming part of the memoranda submitted to the recent Conference of Treasurers by the Federal Treasurer. It shows that he possesses a complete grasp of ,the whole question, and recognises the difficulties associated with it. In this memorandum the right honorable gentleman displayed a complete mastery of the entire subject that must have appealed to .those who took part in the Conference, and if anything can be done at the forthcoming Conference to further the object that we all have so much at heart, I am sure that the Treasurer will do it. We know that we shall have the right man in the right place to represent us at the Conference, and if he succeeds in inducing the States to transfer sufficient security to the Commonwealth, and to make sufficient provision for the payment of interest on the loans taken over by us, he will have accomplished a great work for which the Commonwealth will be eternally grateful. I believe, however, that, on&#39; further consideration, the right honorable gentleman will find that the difficulties in the way of the accomplishment of cur object are even greater than he imagines. . One great difficulty is that the framers of the Constitution did not make the necessary provision to enable us to give full effect to that section which refers especially to the conversion of State loans. The Treasurer knows, of course, that the Commonwealth might take up an absolutely arbitrary position, and say to the Governments of the States - &#34;We are going to take over the whole of your loans, as at the date of Federation,&#34; but, as a matter of fact, the Constitution does not specifically provide for the transfer of the public undertakings or works necessary as security. We know that the States would have to undertake the responsibility of providing for these moneys, but the provisions of the Constitution in regard to this matter are not sufficiently specific. I trust that it will never be necessary for the Commonwealth to bring into operation the constitutional power enabling us to take over these debts without the consent of the States, for such a course of action would be unduly oppressive. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. As the Treasurer remarked at the Conference, it is ne cessary that Ave should approach the consideration of this question with a desire to arrive at a reasonable, business-like understanding. I feel that the Constitution will have to be amended, not only in the direction which I have indicated, but in other ways, in order to avoid the serious complications which are arising in connexion with the loans of the States. The total debts of the States amount in round numbers to &#163;220,000,000. Since Federation loans amounting to &#163;24,952,879 have been raised. </para>

It seems to me that it is desirable that the section of the Constitution known as the &#34; Braddon section &#34; shall be extended-. I believe th21 the Treasurer will find the representatives of the States at the Conference in Hobart more firmly convinced than ever that the finances of the States require that- the time limit fixed by the &#34; Braddon blot &#34; shall be extended very considerably. </para>

              <para>- I read in a newspaper a few days ago that it was the &#34; Braddon blessing.&#34; The provision in question was inserted at the instance of a right honorable gentleman who formerly occupied a seat  in this House, and I trust that he is now receiving the reward of his labours in the interests of the people. I have only to add before I pass from this subject that, to my mind, nothing would be gained by immediate conversion, or by anticipating maturing debts. I believe that it will be necessary for us to issue interminable bonds - bonds resembling British Consols. We cannot deal at once with all the loans. Loans are maturing at specified, dates, whilst there are also loans under notice, but I hope that we shall be able to establish an interminable bond, and that we shall be able to obtain money at a low rate of interest, provided we  give  proper and  sufficient  security. One honorable member, in dealing with this question last night, referred to the fact that our 3 per cent, bonds were selling at a very low price, as compared with the rates prevailing for the stocks of other countries. As one who has had some experience of operations of this kind, I should like to say that public sentiment has an important bearing on the floating of a loan. It is necessary for us to show that we have unquestionable security, but at the present time there is an impression abroad that is adverse to Australian loans. I indorse the statement which has been made that when the people of the States voted for the establishment of the Federation thev considered that the conversion and consolidation of the debts of the States would be one of the first benefits to be derived from it. At the same time, I think it is desirable that we should not expect too much from the Commonwealth in the way of its being able to obtain money, for some time to come, at a very much lower rate of interest than can the Slates. The condition of the money market at the moment we enter it must always be taken into consideration, and until we do something to do away with the unfavorable view which is taken of Australian stocks, I believe that there will be very little margin between the interest paid on the Commonwealth loans and that paid on loans of the States. I wish now to refer to the Pacific Cable. Provision is made in the Estimates for the payment of a sum of &#163;10,000 in respect of Victoria, &#163;10,000 for New South Wales, and &#163;10,000 for Queensland, or a total of &#163;30,000, and I desire to know whether that sum represents the whole loss. </para>

              <para>- All I ask is that these matters may be dealt with as rapidly as possible. In my replies to my correspondents I have said that attention is being given to their appeals, and that I am sure that they will be dealt with as speedily as possible. I had intended to refer to some of the electoral matters to which reference was made by other honorable members on the motion to go into Committee of Supply, but it is not now necessary for me to refer to them. Still, as the Minister of Home Affairs is present. I should like to remind him that we have not yet heard what steps are to be taken in connexion with the alteration of the electoral boundaries, so that there  shall not be a larger number of electors in one division than in another. This is a matter which was regarded as of vital urgency last session. </para>

              <para>- I recognise that, andI understood from the Minister that the Victorian returns are practically complete. I should like the assurance that during the recess, when the Department has collected all the information available, a readjustment of boundaries will take place. Another matter to which I wish to refer is this : To my mind very small provision is made for recognising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan&#39;s</inline> services to the Commonwealth in the compilation of <inline font-style="italic">The Seven Colonies.</inline> That is a work to which we all constantly refer, and which is a standard in other parts of the world for information as to our social, industrial, and economic conditions. It is time that the valuable officer who compiles it was transferred from- the service of a State to that of the Commonwealth. I undertand that at the present time he endeavours to adopt a uniform method of collecting the statistics which he uses, but I do not think that complete uniformity can be obtained until we have a Commonwealth Statistical Bureau. I do not think there would be much additional expense if the arrangement which I suggest were made, because compensating savings could be made. As I have said on other occasions, the Commonwealth is placed in a position of disadvantage in not being properly,and adequately represented in Great Britain, and I should therefore have been glad to see the Government take in hand the HighCommissionership Bill which I am sure would have been readily passed by Parliament. We must have some one in London who can speak for the whole of Australia. I recognise that the co-operation of the States is necessary but itis a pity that the Government has not taken up a stronger position in the matter. I hope that during the recess some definite agreement will be come to with the States on the subject. There are men in this House who could give valuable serviceby representing the Commonwealth in London, and I have already shown that such representation is urgently needed. I referred in the earlier portion of my remarks to a communication from a leading financial centre in London as to the disaster which would overtake any Commonwealth proposal to borrow at the present time. What is needed is to create confidence in London in our financial position, and to improve our status there. The States should raise no objection to this, because undoubtedly what is best for the Commonwealth is best for them individually. Until we are represented there, we shall always be liable to misrepresentation. </para>

            <para>-At the outset I desire to thank the Treasurer for having done something towards removing a long-standing grievance. Ever since the Federation has been established, we have been looking forward to the time when we should be able to retire to rest, feeling that if any enemy came within reach of our shores, we should at least have some protection. It will be remembered that when I first took my seat in this House, I had to make the somewhat grave complaint that the then Government had misappropriated certain moneys voted by the House towards the construction of defence works at Fremantle; and whichI thought should have been spent immediately for that purpose. However, the Treasurer has explained - and I accept the explanation - that he did not at that time understand fully the extent of the expenditure to which that vote committed the Commonwealth. But having recognized that the cost will be somewhat greater than he first anticipated he has taken the proper course of asking the Committee to sanction a portion of the expenditure. I gather from the figures in the Budget papers that it is the intention of the Treasurer to proceed first with the fortification of the position known as Arthur&#39;s Head. It would have been more acceptable to the people of Fremantle if the fortifications at North Fremantle, at which the largest guns are to be mounted, could have been first constructed. There will always be a strong objection to the Arthur&#39;s Head fortification, which is in the middle of the business portion of the town, and will always be regarded as a source of danger. The firing of the gun in that fort will. I fear, cause some damage to the surrounding property. I should have continued to combat the proposal to fortify that position, had I not been convinced, after having personally interviewed the military experts, and having perused their reports, that the town could not be effectively protected from any other point The leader of the Opposition referred yesterday to the alteration that was proposed to be made in the method of apportioning the expenditure upon new works and buildings. I understand that there is considerable  difference  of opinion amongst honorable and learned members as to whether .the Treasurer&#39;s ptoposed action will be constitutional. I do not propose to discuss that point, because where lawyers differ it would be presumption on the part of a layman like myself to attempt to decide. If there be any question as to the legality of the Treasurer&#39;s action, .1 presume that any of the States will have the right to submit .the matter for decision by the High Court. The honorable member for Bland dismissed the legal aspect of the question, and proceeded to deal with it from the stand-point of equity. He complained that the Treasurer was proposing to spend some &#163;24,000 in the erection of fortifications in Western Australia, and that the whole of the States would be called upon to contribute. I am quite sure that the people of Western Australia have no wish to be treated differently from the citizens of other parts of  the Commonwealth. They are quite willing to have applied to them the same rule that is made to operate with regard to the rest of the Commonwealth - all other things being equal. But it seems to me that the objection raised by the honorable member for Bland loses Its point when it is considered that although it is true that the whole Commonwealth will be asked to contribute towards the erection of these works, it is also true that the Commonwealth has taken over from each of the States similar works and buildings for which it will have to pay. I can see no essential difference between constructing works and buildings, and paying for them now. and taking over similar&#39; works and buildings, which have been paid for by the States, and reimbursing those States. </para>

              <para>- We shall have to put our hands into our pockets by-and-by, in order to enable the Commonwealth to return to Victoria, New South Wales, and other States, the money that they have spent upon their defence works. It is only fair to say that it is not the fault of the Commonwealth that we have not yet received from the States, accounts of their expenditure. For some reason the States Treasurers will not tell us how much they want us to pay for the transferred properties, and it is very largely owing to their fault that we have not entered into some arrangement. I hold that there is no essential difference between the Commonwealth now paying money for the construction of works and buildings, and our eventually reimbursing the States for the expenditure that they have already incurred- upon similar works and buildings. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth, one or two public works have been constructed and the States concerned have been debited with their cost. Take, for instance, the construction of the telegraph line to Tarcoola. That work was recommended by the officers of South Australia, constructed by the Commonwealth, and the cost debited to that State. I understand that as soon as we arrive at an arrangement with the States regarding the mode of payment to be adopted in compensating them for their transferred properties, the work to which I have referred will be included  with  other public works, so that South Australia will be treated in exactly the same way as it is proposed to treat Western Australia. It is unfortunate in some respects that this departure from the method which has previously been followed should have been made at a period when the expenditure is absolutely necessary. I am convinced that if any other State had received the first advantage arising out of that departure, the same objections would not have been raised. </para>

              <para>- That observation brings me to the question of the redistribution of the surplus revenue. Some honorable members appear to think that because the people of Western Australia tax themselves more heavily than do the rest of the Commonwealth, they gain an advantage at the expense of the other States. I fail to follow the logic of any such reasoning. The people of Western Asutralia would be glad indeed if they could in any way reduce their own taxation. They have an immense territory to develop, and they have to bear a very large expenditure in administration as compared with States containing a much smaller area. -Yet they are doing these things with credit to themselves, despite the fact that they constitute a mere handful. Moreover, Western Australia is spending many thousands of pounds in public works and buildings every year. Seeing that its people are doing so much, and that ultimately this expenditure will benefit the whole of Australia, surely we ought not to cavil because they are allowed to tax themselves in excess of other portions of the Commonwealth ? Coming to the question of the bookkeeping period, I wish to say that the Treasurer will shortly be brought face to face with a very difficult problem. He has always recognised that it would be impossible to terminate the &#39;bookkeeping system without making some special provision for Western Australia. No doubt honorable members have analysed the figures in his Budget papers which set out the difference which the distribution of the surplus revenue upon a population basis would have made to the various States. If the bookkeeping system had not been in vogue - if the surplus revenue had been distributed upon a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis - the loss to Western Australia would have been as follows: - 1901 -2,. &#163;658,256; i9&#176;2-3.- ^579^34; 1903-4, :&#163;453,&#39;31:&#62; and the estimate for 1.904-5 is &#163;468, 621, or a total during four years of &#163;2,160,242. I have merely to quote these figures to show that the revenue of Western Australia would have been, paralyzed if these amounts had been withheld from it. The only other State of the union which would have lost under a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> distribution is New South Wales, which during the same period would have suffered to the extent of -&#163;165,000. In his Budget speech the Treasurer mentioned that, with the approaching expiry of the book keeping period, under which the revenue of Western Australia had been afforded this protection, it might be necessary to adopt a sliding scale. He suggested that the bookkeeping system might be extended for ten years, during which existing differences might be gradually wiped out, so that Western Australia might approximate more closely to the other States in a distribution of the surplus revenue upon a population basis. I do not know whether he has worked out any scheme in this direction. I imagine that he has bestowed some thought upon it, otherwise he would scarcely have made the suggestion. I do not pretend to prophesy how such a method, if adopted, would work out. But considering the complications which would arise under two sets of bookkeeping, I am of opinion that it would involve as much work as does the present system. </para>

              <para>- The difference between the other States is not very great. If it were not for the peculiar position which Western Australia occupies we might even abolish the bookkeeping system in five years. That being so, why not abolish that system and make some special provision in the case of the western State ? I am hopeful that before many years have passed the conditions in Western Australia will approximate more closely to those obtaining in the other States, and the time may come when we shall find that the difference between Western Australia and the other States is so small that we shall be able to say, &#34; At the end of this or the next financial year no more bookkeeping shall be done.&#34; If we hold ourselves free to take such action when the occasion arises, it seems to me that it will be preferable to embarking upon a ten years&#39;sliding scale, which might mean additional work after the necessity for its performance had disappeared. Some honorable members have spoken of the unpopularity of Federation, and have agreed with certain criticism which has been bestowed upon this Parliament. -We have been charged with extravagant expenditure. I confess at once - not having been a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament - that it did appear to an outsider that the salaries paid bv this Parliament were upon a somewhat lavish scale when compared with those paid by the various Stales </para>

          <para class="block">Governments. Some little criticism on the part of members of the States Legislatures was therefore to be expected. We have no desire to curtail the powers of &#39; criticism of members of the States Legislatures, if they are of opinion that we are doing anything inimical to those States. But whilst I shared that view for a time, I am free to admit that after the first two years of the Federation no such criticism was justifiable. If there is one thing more than another which has contributed to build up the reputation of the Treasurer it is the fact that he sits very tightly upon the Treasury chest. He would be more popular than he is if he were a little more generous in his public expenditure. Then it has been affirmed that this Parliament, during the present session, has brought discredit upon itself and upon the whole Federation. When the honorable and learned member for Parkes was speaking, last evening, I interjected that one reason for the waning popularity of Federation was that the people of Australia, in adopting the Commonwealth Constitution, had been led to expect too much. Those honorable members who took an active part in the agitation for the establishment of the Commonwealth will recollect that the picture presented to the electors was very much overdrawn. It was stated that when once the Commonwealth was established, happiness, peace&#39;, and contentment would follow. I remember certain flaming posters being displayed all over South Australia, in which the people were promised all sorts of things if they would adopt the Commonwealth Constitution Bill. The opponents of Federation pointed out that a large sum of money would require to be expended to get the Commonwealth into working order. I remember that the advocates of the Bill assured the public that, so far from Federation imposing any additional expenditure upon the taxpayer, it would actually result in the saving of money. They were informed by one gentleman, who occupies a very high position in another branch of the Legislature, that as the result of the federalization of the States debts more than sufficient money would be saved in the course of a few years to defray the whole cost of government. All these predictions have been unfulfilled. It is only too evident that, from a party point of view, some of those who urged the acceptance of the Constitution have been keenly disappointed. They anticipated that the Federal Parliament would consist, I was going to say, of representatives of only one class, but perhaps that would be too harsh a statement to make. On their own confession, however, they expected that there would not be many representatives of labour in this House - that we should have that rarer atmosphere of which we have heard so much, and that they were going to carry on the business of the country very much to their own liking. The fact that the people of Australia have not returned these men has produced a good deal of dissatisfaction and disappointment, and we have the conservative press on every side complaining that the Commonwealth Parliament is passing legislation which was never anticipated There is one aspect of this question which is worthy of comment. The attempts made from time to time to discredit an opposing party sometimes lead to the making of statements which reflect not only upon that party but upon the country whose interests we are here to conserve. Honorable members know full well that some of the wild statements made, particularly by the conservative organs, as to the effect of legislation passed by us, are viewed more seriously in Great Britain than in Australia, where we are cognizant of the reasons for such assertions. I believe that a good deal of the socalled unpopularity from which the Commonwealth suffers to-day has arisen from the injudicious comments and unjustifiable attacks which have been made for purely party purposes, and which have reflected, and must always reflect, on the Commonwealth as a whole. I hope that the present situation, of which we have heard so much of late, will shortly find its solution. I believe that it will, and that in spite of tha fact that at present there appears to be little or no work transacted by the Parliament, we shall have an alteration before long in the position of parties in this House, which will give one side or the other a working majority, and enable us to carry on the business of the country in a manner creditable to ourselves, and profitable to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I wish to deal with only one item forming part of the Budget statement. I refer to the question of defence. It will be remembered that last year the Defence Force of Tasmania was reduced to a level below that of the rest of the Commonwealth, and that a certain amount of dissatisfaction arose, which resulted in the disbandment of the southern forces. The northern forces of Tasmania, however, remained true to their principles, and expected that they would be treated in the generous manner indicated by the then Treasurer, the right honorable member for Balaclava, in last year&#39;s Budget statement. The right honorable member then stated that such a thing as that of which the troops complained would not happen again. As a matter of fact, however, we find that the Estimates now submitted to us provide for the payment of the forces in Tasmania for only six months, instead of twelve - their pay is to date from 1st January next, instead of from 1st July of this year. I trust that the Tasmanian Forces, which have remained true to their principles, will be granted that which was promised them, and which they expected to receive. I believe that the volunteers of that State would willingly serve their country without any payment whatever ; but thev regard it as a slight to be asked to receive less than that given to their brethren on the mainland. I mention this matter at this early stage in the debate, so that when we are called upon to deal with the Defence estimates, we shall be in a position to treat the forces in Tasmania in the manner they deserve. It will be remembered that, in speaking on the motion for the adoption of the Address in Reply, at the opening of this Parliament, I referred to the wav in which our volunteers had been treated. During the debate which has taken place this afternoon, a good deal has been said as to the large expenditure contemplated on defence works in Western Australia; but I have not heard of any proposal to expend large sums on such things as fortifications in Tasmania. I do not complain of that, but Tasmania expects that her volunteers shall be treated on truly Federal lines. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Franklin seems to think that it is unwise to encourage a native industry by extending to it a measure of protection even less than that enjoyed by others which are not to be compared with that of sugargrowing. Has the honorable member any idea of the proportion of protection afforded other industries, compared with that which is extended to the one now under notice? The hat and boot making trades are both protected by duties of 30 per cent., and the protection which the sugar-growing industry receives, does not at all events exceed that, although it is equal in every way to the industries to which I have referred. Honorable members from other States do not find the representatives of Queensland complaining that their industries are protected, while Queensland is not producing the articles which many of them manufacture. It may surprise the Committee to know that the products of some of the protected industries that are of material assistance to Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, are being used inQueensland in large and increasing quantities. </para>

              <para>-I am aware of that, but I cannot forget that the, Minister of Trade and Customs has frequently drawn attention to what he describes as the serious inroads being made on the revenue of Victoria, as the result of the White Australia legislation. I venture to say that when he looks carefully into the matter, he will see good grounds for the view I have always adopted, that this expenditure, if it really be an expenditure, is justified by the circumstances of the case. I quite, agree with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the sugar-growers have received the most active support of the prominent protectionists of Victoria. The great body of the protectionist members of this House supported the representatives of Queensland in securing this protection for the sugargrowers of the northern State, and I express my satisfaction at their action. The principle is a sound one, and our action in passing the Act has been fully justified, because the number of white growers of sugar has since steadily increased. The matter to which I now direct the Treasurer&#39;s attention is this : that having discovered that our legislation is satisfactory, it is our duty to continue it. The time has arrived when it is advisable to give, if not legislative effect to our opinions, at least a promise to the white sugar-growers that the Parliament, having seen the wisdom of the measure in question, is prepared to continue it. </para>

              <para>- The Treasurer put the matter so clearlv before honorable members in his Budget statement that I did not think it necessary at the time to make any further reference to it, more especially as I knew that he held the financial strings of the Government of Australia. I am sure that the right honorable gentleman knows exactly the position in which Queensland stands. In answer to the honorable member for Grampians, I admit that this Parliament cannot bind the next. But it was entirely against my will - it was in opposition to the efforts which I made, both privately and publiclv - that a limitation was imposed on the duration of the Sugar Bounty Act. I think I may say, without any breach of confidence, that the reason why some of my fellowrepresentatives from Queensland urged that a time lirr.it should be fixed, was that they feared the present Prime Minister. I think that fear was due, so far as some honorable members were concerned, to the impetuosity of youth. We should have done much better had we passed the Bill without fixingany time limit, because it would have been open to us to repeal it at any time, had the circumstances shown that its continuance was not justified. The Prime Minister, who was then the leader of the Opposition, promised that he would respect the principle of the Act, up to the 1st January, 1907, at least, when it would expire. He made a very clear statement to that effect. </para>

              <para>- I would ask the honorable member whether anything has happened since the passing of the Act that would justify the Prime Minister in refusing to agree to its extension beyond that date. I have never doubted the right honorable gentleman&#39;s statement that he would respect it to the date named. When the sugar duties were under discussion, he stated that he would agree to a certain course, and that he believed, so far as hecould see, that this legislation was worthy of a fair trial. It has had a fair trial, and the results have justified the action of this Parliament in passing it. It has been stated that the production of sugar by coloured labour has increased in Queensland. Although I have not been able to put my finger on the statistics necessary to prove my contention, I have no hesitation in saying that that is not a correctstatement. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the Treasurer is now awaiting a letter of explanation ; but I can advance a supposition which I think is reasonable. My idea is that the difference may be accounted for by the fact that probably  producers  who employ white labour when they register give, not the area which they have under sugar cane, but the area of their whole farms, part of which may be under other crops. </para>

              <para>- Another explanation that may be put forward to account for the large increase in the amount of sugar grown by black labour, is that last year and the year before were bad seasons in the southern part of Queensland. In my own district, owing to the severe drought, some black labour plantations had practically no crushing at all, and the cane was allowed to stand over till this good year. In some cases there has been no -crushing for three years. </para>

I shall leave it to the honorable member for Richmond to place before the Committee the case of the New South Wales growers, but so far as Queensland is concerned I would point out to the right honorable member for Swan that instead of the bounty having made sugar-growing a very profitable industry, the farmers engaged in it have a very keen struggle to earn a living. </para>

              <para>- The subject is very technical, and even those who are most closely acquainted with it feel that it is a difficult one. A most  experienced Customs officer who has recently visited the sugar-growing districts has made a most satisfactory report upon the operation of the bounty. He says that he found no occasion to complain of the honesty of the white growers, and in only one case has it been found necessary to take the matter into Court. The appointment of inspectors has been of great assistance to the white growers, and the complaints which have been made have arisen rather from want of knowledge than from a desire to evade the Act. The point I wish to make, however, is that the 2,142 white families engaged in the production of sugar are worth more to the State of Queensland than large plantations which employ only a few white persons and a large number of coloured persons. But unless Parliament continues the bounty these 2,142 white families will find it impossible to carry on. </para>

              <para>- No, because without a bounty the white grower has to compete directly with the black grower. The only difference between them is the bounty. The white grower pays &#163;3 per ton in excise duty, and receives a bounty of &#163;2 per ton, while the coloured grower pays the excise duty, and gets no bounty. Experts who have gone into the matter have shown that . the &#39;bounty is equivalent to the difference between the wages of coloured labour and those of white labour. Therefore, if we intend to encourage the production of sugar by white labour we must continue it. I regret that so much opposition has been shown by members representing other States to this expenditure by the  Commonwealth  Queenslanders have not complained of the effect of the Federal Tariff in reducing their revenue, although they have hard a hard struggle to make ends meet. They maintain that as they  invested  a large amount of public. as well private money in. the Central Mills prior to Federation, purely for the encouragement of the production of sugar by white labour, the Federal Parliament should not desert them in their hour of need, because other States do not receive a bounty. It is no fault of Queensland that Victorian growers are not obtaining a bounty for the production of beet sugar by white labour. When the question was under discussion, I was ready to agree to a provision under which a bounty would be given for the production of sugar from beet; but, as a matter of fact, there is nothing to prevent Victorians who produce beet sugar by white labour from getting a bounty, and there are no climatic reasons why beet should not be grown here. As a set-off to the statements which have been made about the cost of the bounty system to the Commonwealth, I would like to remind honorable members of the loss of revenue which Queensland suffers under the Federal Tariff. In 1902, boots and shoes, to the value of &#163;55,910, were sent from the other States to Queensland, while in 1903 the value was .&#163;81,583. </para>

              <para>- I do not desire to go back so far, but if I did, the contrast would be all in favour of my position. Queensland is paying to encourage indirectly the industries of the other States, but she makes no complaint about it. I hope, therefore, that the representatives of the other States will not attack the sugar industry, which is really the only industry from which Queensland&#39; gets an advantage under the Tariff. In 1902, Queensland imported from the other States confectionery to the value of &#163;7,275, whilst in the following year the imports of that class of goods reached the value of &#163;23,808. We were told that the jam industry would suffer in consequence of the sugar duties, but I am glad to say that that industry appears to be developing, especially in Tasmania. </para>

              <para>-- That is quite correct. Whilst I was presiding over the Department of Trade and Customs, I did everything possible to facilitate the operations of the manufacturers of jam and other articles, and I granted the fullest drawbacks possible upon jams that were sent out of Australia. My action in that matter- aroused a little hostile feeling in my own electorate, but I felt sure that I was taking up a sound position. The manufacture of jam is an industry which is entitled to the fullest encouragement, because it has a tendency to assist our fruit-growers, by providing them with an outlet for the products of their orchards. It must be remembered that although one-sixth of the duty upon sugar used in making jam which is exported beyond the Commonwealth, is lost to the manufacturers, there is a protective duty upon imported jams, which is of some advantage to them. It will be satisfactory to the honorable member for Franklin to know that practically the whole of the jam consumed in Queensland is imported from the other States. Only &#163;^840 worth of jam is imported from parts beyond the Commonwealth. The people of Queensland show a marked partiality for Australian products. They do not stop to inquire whether, by indulging their preference they will cause a loss of revenue. They have the satisfaction, of course, of knowing that, in many instances, they are consuming jam made by manufacturers who use Queensland sugar. In 1902 the imports of jam from other States were valued at &#163;44,385, and in 1903 at .&#163;53&#62;598- The imports of dresses and tailor-made goods from the other States in 1902 were valued at &#163;29,043, and in 1903 at  &#163;52,715.  Unfortunately, owing to the hard times through which Queensland has passed, its population has not been expanding so rapidly in recent years, and the purchasing power of the community, owing, largely, to the very severe drought, has been decreasing rather than otherwise. They have, however, been steadily transferring their favour from foreign goods to the Australian article. </para>

              <para>- I am glad to say that it is. We do not wish our people to purchase imported products for the sake of the revenue derived from the payment of the duty upon them. In 1902 Queensland imported from the other States, hats valued at &#163;ir,965, whilst last year the imports were  worth &#163;17,673. Having regard to the fact that a 30 per cent, duty is levied upon imported hats, this increase in the importation of goods from the other States alone made a considerable difference to the State Treasurer. I know nothing of the reasons which influence merchants in buying Australian as distinguished from foreign goods, but I take it for granted that they would not purchase them unless they were convinced that they received good value for their money. They must derive considerable advantage from the fact that their orders can be speedily filled by the local manufacturers, and that, therefore, they are not under the necessity of keeping excessively large stocks. It is only by encouraging our industries that we can hope to make Australia a great country. </para>

I would&#39; point out to the honorable member for Maranoa that during the last few years we have been labouring under difficulties other than those created by the drought. Practically all the States Governments stopped borrowing, and made up their minds to live within their means, at a time of the greatest trial and difficulty. Had the change been brought about at an ordinary period, its effects would not have been so keenly felt. We now have the satisfaction of knowing that we have begun to live within our income, and I believe that we shall very shortly march ahead. </para>

              <para>- So long as they keep on wanting more, they cannot make true progress. The Commonwealth has laid down a sound principle in regard to its finances, and although I do not for one moment urge that the States should not borrow any further, I. think that their operations in that direction should be very limited. I hope that I shall be supported by the honorable member for Richmond and others who are acquainted with the facts of the case, when I suggest that, if we cannot, during this session, pass a measure to amend the Sugar Bounty Act in the direction of providing for the continuance of the bounties, we shah at least be favoured with a clear and definite statement by the Prime Minister that the matter will receive favorable consideration during the next session. Nothing less than that would be of any use to the sugar-growers. As I pointed out to the honorable member for Franklin, the white sugar-growers do not seek a large degree of protection. All they desire is that the bounties shall be continued as some set off to the disadvantage under which they labour, in having to pay higher wages to the white employes who have replaced the kanakas -in the cane-fields. Every one will admit that it is far more desirable that we should settle white farmers and their families upon small farms than that we should encourage the establishment of large plantations upon which coloured labour is employed. I trust that the Government will give early consideration to the question of taking over the quarantine Departments of the States. We are empowered under the Constitution to take over the quarantine Departments by proclamation, and we should exercise our authority forthwith. When I was in office, as Minister of Trade and <inline font-style="italic">Customs, I convened</inline> a Conference to consider the possibility of transferring the States Quarantine Departments to the Commonwealth. It was unanimously agreed by the Conference that it was desirable that the Federal Government should take over the Quarantine Departments&#39; at the earliest possible moment. The difficulties in the way are not very great. Large powers are conferred under the various States Acts, and these could be exercised by the Federal Executive, under regulations which would be binding on the whole of the States. The Minister in charge of the Department would then have an opportunity to acquaint himself with the necessities of the case before being called upon to introduce a Quarantine Bill into this Parliament. My short experience has led me to believe that it is advisable for the Minister to make himself acquainted with the details of the work of administering his Department, rather than to lean too much upon specialists&#39; advice in preparing a Bill. That is a reason why I think that the Quarantine Departments of the States should be taken over by proclamation without delay. I desire to correct a statement which has been repeatedly made by the State Treasurer, an  1  others in Queensland, that one of the regulations under the Sugar Bounty permits of the bounty being paid in respect to sugar grown upon land planted <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> coloured labour after the 28th February, 1903. I have sent a written reply stating that that provision is not contained in a regulation, but in the statute itself. When members in responsible positions know the facts, they ought to state them clearly. It is idle to appeal to the prejudices of the people by declaring that the Commonwealth Government will not do this, that, or the other thing. I hope that the Government will never exercise any power which is not delegated to them by statute. Section 2 of the Sugar Bounty Act of 1903 reads - </para>

          <para class="block">That puts the matter so clearly, that he who runs may read. I do not propose to enter into a discussion of the political phases of this question. I merely say, &#34; There is the law, and that Taw must be administered.&#34; In conclusion, I trust that this question will be approached, not with the fear that a loss of revenue may be sustained by the, States which are not engaged in the production of sugar, but from a national standpoint. We have always been led to expect that wherever a great Australian industry could be assisted, and especially where white people could be settled upon the soil, this Parliament would extend just, if not generous, consideration to them. </para>

I do not propose to debate the question of the effect of the excise, but merely wish to deal with the effect of the bounty.

              <para>- I do not propose to deal with them. I shall confine my remarks to the principles underlying the proposals in respect of sugar. Rarely has an expenditure of &#163;100,000 called into existence within the course of two or three years national wealth to the extent of &#163;600,000. I do not agree with all the Treasurer&#39;s figures in detail.  Taking those figures, and arguing solely from them, I find that in 1902, 83,000 tons of sugar . were imported, whereas for 1904-5 it is estimated that only 42,000 tons will be imported. . There will thus be a decrease in our importations of 41,000 tons, representing a value of, say, &#163;600,000. That is to say, the expenditure of &#163;100,000 by way of bonus has, if we argue as honorable members have done all through the debate, increased the national wealth by &#163;500,000. </para>

              <para>- The Treasurer is often as inaccurate as is the honorable member. I am dealing only with the Treasurer&#39;s figures, and not with his statements. Surely the honorable member does not hold me responsible for those delightful poetical effusions of the right honorable member?  His  imagination may be inaccurate, but his figures are generally correct. I repeat that we have expended &#163;100,000 by way of bonus, and as a result have increased the national wealth by &#163;500,000 within two or three years. This result is so splendid that it must be satisfactory even to the socialistic gentlemen opposite. Some honorable members have pointed out that the black labour employed in New South Wales at the present time is greater than it was two years ago.- Although I am a Government supporter, for the noblest of all reasons, namely, that I desire to keep worse persons out of office- </para>

              <para>- Yes. Honorable members must recollect that when we passed the Pacific Island Labourers Act, New South Wales was threatened with a serious augmentation of black labour. The legislation to which I have referred arrested that. What did we expect to happen from a national stand-point within two years ? That period is not worth considering in the life of a nation. There are some representatives who believe that to impose an excise duty of &#163;5 per ton upon sugar, and an import duty of &#163;6 per ton, would work satisfactorily. If we acted in that fashion, it is obvious that our sugar-growers would be protected only to the extent of&#163;1 per ton. The mere statement of the case ought to be sufficient to dispose of any idea of that description. </para>

The price may then fall, as the result of internal competition. To some extent I feel that we are beating the air in regard to this matter. Last night the Prime Minister informed the House that the Tariff Commission would deal with it. The honorable member for Wide Bay pointed out what everybody knows is the serious aspect of this question, namely, that a sugar crop lasts for seven years, whereas a bonus at present is provided for only two years. That is the position in a nutshell. What is to be done during the remaining five years ? If the Commission is to deal with the matter at once- </para>

              <para>- No doubt that is so. The Prime Minister informed us that he would deal with this matter as soon as he could do so, and that is as far as we are likely to get. As the honorable member for Herbert has said, there are other questions than the Tariff issue involved. We know as a matter of fact that the Federal Parliament determined to deal with this matter, not on any commercial or fiscal basis, but from the stand-point that the bounty is the price paid for a White Australia. That was the national purpose, the broad ideal, which we had before us in passing the legislation bearing on this subject. I have no desire to give the Committee a dissertation on the policy of a White Australia. My views upon the question are already well known ; but one scarcely feels disposed to allow a question of this kind, which affects an industry in which a number of his constituents are engaged, to pass unnoticed. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs that this matter should be dealt with by the Government in the immediate future, and that it is our  duty to see. that they deal with it in that broad and reasonable way which has characterized all their actions. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to give the Committee an explanation. Honorable members will recollect that two elections - one in respect of the electorate of Melbourne, and the other in respect of the electorate of Riverina - were declared void. My attention was then officially called to the fact, and it was decided, after the law officers of the Crown had been consulted, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood,</inline> who had drawn their allowances as Members of Parliament from the date of the elections to the date on which they were declared void, were not legally entitled to the money so received. The matter also came under the notice of the Auditor- General, who referred it to me. I then applied to the two gentlemen named for a refund of the moneys so received, and they at once paid it back. Shortly afterwards the Government of which I was a member went out of office, and on my return recently I found that the honorable member for Bland, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, had caused this sum to be placed on the Estimates. Finding that he had initialed a document approving of the two amounts which go to make up this item being placed on the Estimates, I did not interfere with them; but had I re- maineduninterruptedly in office,inall probability I should not have made this provision. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn is out of Victoria, and I do not know whether he desires to draw the sum. of &#163;94 12s. 5d. which it is proposed to refund to him; but </para>

              <para>- Although the elections were declared void, the two gentlemen in question served as members of this House. The mere fact that they have not asked for a refund of the money has nothing whatever to do with the principle at issue. The principle is that Government officials were responsible for the voiding of the two elections - they were responsible for the actions which led up to the Court proceedings - and therefore the Government itself is responsible. I put it to the Committee and the country whether it is proper that a man who offers himself as a candidate should be made to suffer for the faults of Government officials. A man might be declared duly elected, and go to the expense of bringing his wife and family from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Melbourne, only to be unseated shortly afterwards ; and should he, in such circumstances, be refused the paltry honorarium which the Constitution allows to members of Parliament? It would be monstrous to decide that nothing, even by way of the ordinary allowance, should be paid to gentlemen who have been formally declared elected. When the question came under my notice the solicitor for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn demurred to the Law Department&#39;s reading of the law. In his view, the law was that the sitting member for the time being was entitled to the allowance provided for by the Constitution. I obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General on that question, and found that it did not coincide with that given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn&#39;s solicitor, and without any request from either of the two gentlemen concerned, I decided to place these amounts on the Estimates. There is a further point involved, to which  1 would like to invite the attention of the Government. I did not have time to deal with the question, as to the position of all the other candidates at the two elections which were voided, but it was clear that two gentlemen were returned to this House who, through no fault of their own, were put to enormous expense owing to the actions of Government officials. They had to pass through the ordeal of a second election in consequence of this neglect, and whilst I do not say that the whole of the legal expenses attaching to the fighting of the two cases should be borne by the Commonwealth, I do say that some allowance should be made for the loss which these gentlemen sustained owing to the delinquencies of Commonwealth officers. In New South Wales, in several cases, where it was clearly shown that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the candidates, both the successful and the unsuccessful candidates were reimbursed their expenses in respect of elections declared void. In the case of the Commonwealth, the election expenses which a candidate may incur are limited, and, consequently, the sums in:volved could not be so large as they might have been under the law of New South Wales. It seems to me that the Government should take some financial responsibility for the actions of their officers, otherwise every candidate for election to this Parliament will be called upon to run the risk of financial ruin. </para>

              <para>- That is another question. When this matter was brought under my notice, in the way I have mentioned, I thought it was only, fair to give the Committee an opportunity to pronounce an opinion upon it. So far as the equities are concerned, I think -that all those gentlemen who were put to considerable expense through no fault of their own should be  fairly  treated, and that the Commonwealth has a right to rectify, so far as is reasonable, the faults of omission or of commission of which its officials have been guilty. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MCDONALD</inline>(Kennedy). - I was familiar with the facts explained by the Treasurer, and rose to speak, because I fully agreed with the action taken by the honorable member for Bland. It is outrageous that honorable members should be put to enormous expense owing to the negligence of the Electoral Department, and I think that the Government&#39; should reimburse not only <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEeacharn  and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood,</inline> but others who incurred expense in the same way, owing to the fault of Government officials. Otherwise, it seems to me that no honorable member is safe. If an honorable member were returned by a majority of three or four votes, and the defeated candidate then took proceedings to have the election declared void, on the ground that some mistake had been committed by the Electoral Department, he would be put to very serious expense. He sits in this Chamber. Then the election is upset on some technicality, and he has either to contest it again or lose his seat. The honorable members who now represent Riverina and Melbourne, through no fault of their own, were plunged into enormous expense in the maintenance of their rights. In the first instance, two other candidates were elected&#39; for those constituencies, and they sat in this House for some time, receiving the remuneration provided for by the Constitution. That money they have been compelled to refund, and a sum has been put on the Estimates to pay it to them again. I see no objection to that, because undoubtedly while they sat here they did the work required  of them by the electors, and were therefore entitled to the statutory remuneration. I think, however, that a sum should also be placed on the Estimates to recompense the two sitting members for the great expense they were put to, through the fault of the Government officials, to obtain their rights. I understand that it is impossible to increase the amount of an item. </para>

              <para>- I understand that the right honorable gentleman thinks that the principle is wrong. After the last general elections two gentlemen were declared to be duly elected for Melbourne and Riverina respectively. They were sworn in, took their seats in this Chamber, and discharged the duties of representatives of the people for a considerable period. Action was taken in the High Court, however, which led to the elections being declared void, not through any fault committed by the candidates, but through the fault of the Government officials. The seats were thereupon declared vacant, and another election was held, resulting in the return of the two members who now sit. The proposition before us is that the two gentlemen first elected should be paid the amount of remuneration which they received for the period during which they sat in this House, but which they were compelled to refund. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps honorable members have made up their minds on this matter. It is one on which I think opinions should be expressed for and against. When an election is declared void through the fauit of an official the Government is morallybound to reimburse the candidates their election and Court expenses. That principle has been adopted in New South Wales. It has been the practice of different Governments to place a sum upon the Estimates to cover the expenses incurred in cases similar to those which we are now considering. At the generalelection before last in that State, a petition was lodged against the successful candidate for the representation of the district for which I formerly sat in the State Parliament. The election was declared void, primarily on the ground that the Government had illegally cancelled a certain polling-place, after the writs had been issued. A re-election took place, and the two candidates were allowed &#163;100 to cover the expenses which they had incurred in consequence of a second contest being rendered necessary. Other cases of a similar nature could be cited in order to show that the principle has been generally recognised. I trust that the Treasurer will see his way to make provision for the payment of a reasonable sum to recoup the expenses incurred by the candidates whose elections were upset owing to the neglect or incompetence of the electoral officials. </para>

            <para>- I listened with seme surprise to one of the statements made by the Treasurer. He indicated that he did not approve of the action of his predecessor in office in placing a sum upon the Estimates to reimburse former honorable members who had been called upon to refund allowances drawn by them prior to their seats having been declared vacant by the High Court. We shall occupy a somewhat extraordinary position if it is held that honorable members who have been paid their allowances by the Treasury officials whilst sitting as members of this House shall be called upon to refund such payments in the event of their seats being declared vacant. If an honorable member is declared elected and sworn in, and takes part in the deliberations of this House, he is surely entitled to be paid. According to the decision given by the Attorney-General, however, be cannot be regarded as a member of this House. </para>

              <para>- In effect, it has been declared that the two gentlemen named obtained money wrongfully, and they were, upon that supposition, called upon to refund it. All sorts of complications might arise under such a decision, and I think that further inquiries should be made in order that honorable members may feel more secure than is possible under present conditions. The only safe course to adopt in order to prevent cases of a similar character arising is to refrain from paying honorable members their allowances until the time has expired for the lodging of petitions against their election. I support the contention of the honorable member for Bland, and I think that we are entitled to ask for some expression of opinion from the Government. Our electoral law is based upon demo cratic principles, and is intended to give equal opportunities to every qualified person to become a member of this House, thereby giving the widest choice to the electors. When we inserted in the Act the provision limiting the amount to be spent by a candidate at an election, we sought to render it impossible for a wealthy man to bribe a constituency, or to place a poorer candidate at an overwhelming disadvantage. Unless candidates are to be safeguarded against being mulcted in heavy costs through some informality in connexion with their elections, no man will be able to offer himself as a candidate for Parliament without exposing himself to the risk of ruin. Where a seat is declared void, owing to some negligence on the part of the electoral officials, it is only right that the candidates who are thus put to unnecessary expense should be compensated for their outlay. A private employer is held responsible for the laches of any of his servants, and we, as the employers of the officials who conduct elections, should shoulder the responsibility of any default on their part. I should not have directed attention to this matter but for the remarks of the Treasurer, which seemed to&#39; indicate that he would not, if he remained in power, make any provision for reimbursements in cases such as I have referred to. I trust that the Committee will express its opinion without hesitation, and that the Government will declare its views. Not only should the item now on the Estimates be passed, but we should make provision for recompensing all candidates who have been involved in loss through no neglect of their own. It seems to me that this action will be necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the Electoral Act, which is intended to give fair play to rich and poor alike. Many mistakes were made during the recent elections, and many honorable members who are now sitting here might have been unseated if any one had chosen to present petitions against them. </para>

            <para>- I support the suggestion made by the leader of the Opposition. I think it is time that the Treasurer informed us whether he regards it with favour or disfavour. In the latter event, it might be desirable to test the feeling of the Committee, not in any hostile spirit, but in order to lay down a broad principle for the guidance of the present and succeeding Governments. If an election is voided by reason of some irregularity arising from the error, negligence, or incompetence of the electoral officials, it is  only fair that the. candidates who are put to the cost of a second contest should be recouped their expenses. </para>

              <para>- Under the Electoral Act a candidate is allowed to spend &#163;100 in contesting a seat for the House of Representatives, in addition to his travelling expenses. Personally, I am of opinion that a candidate who is unseated through no fault of his own, should be reimbursed the amount of his scheduled expenses, in addition to his personal expenses. The further question then arises as to whether he should not be allowed the costs which he is called upon to bear in prosecuting an appeal before a proper tribunal. I do not wish it to appear that honorable members are asking for what is unjust; but I do think that a candidate who is by law admitted to be the individual who should have been declared elected upon the first occasion, ought to be placed in the position that he would have occupied had he been so elected. Take the case of the Riverina election. It is admitted that if the returning officer in that division had accurately counted the votes recorded its present representative in this House would have been declared duly elected upon the first occasion. That fact is not disputed. Had the returning officer allowed a recount, to permit of a mistake on the part of an assistant returning officer being corrected, no trouble would have been experienced. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> was not responsible for the error in the counting, neither was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter.</inline> It may have been an act of negligence, but the candidates were in no way to blame. Then I would direct attention to the election for the district of Melbourne. In that case, as the result of a circular issued under the authority of the Electoral Department, certain errors were committed in connexion with postal votes. The officer directly concerned was able to make out a fairly good case in support of his action, but the candidates were perfectly innocent of his mistake, and so were the electors. In both these cases, the elections were voided, and the successful candidates were subjected to a heavy expenditure. Under the circumstances, it seems to me that it is only reasonable that they should be reimbursed their original expenses, according to their filed returns, in addition to their travelling expenses. I do not know what was the cost of the litigation which ensued. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> had to pay a large sum to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter.</inline></para>

I admit that it was very hard that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> should be called upon to pay the cost of the election petition, but it would have been still harder upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> if he had not received some costs. I am not aware what amount he did receive, but I know that it did not re-imburse the whole of his outofpocket expenses. I merely wish to ascertain whether the Treasurer will promise to inquire into this matter, and whether, if he is satisfied that the proposal is a reasonable one, he will place this sum upon the Supplementary Estimates ? </para>

If it be right that the Commonwealth should pay the expenses of a candidate who is called upon to contest another election, owing to the fault of a returning officer, surely it can be claimed, with equal justice, that all the legal expenses which that candidate has incurred as the result of an official blunder, should also be paid. </para>

              <para>- 1 do not propose to say one word in favour of the manner in which the elections were conducted in some of the States, because I know that their conduct evidenced a great lack of ability. But seeing that those elections were conducted under a totally new system, and that the electoral officers were new to their duties, I think that they would have been more than human if some errors of judgment had not been committed. Personally, I believe that the whole of the Electoral Department will require to be reorganized before another general election is held. I desire honorable members clearly to understand where this proposal will lead us. There is no common sense in asking the Commonwealth to defray one portion of a bill of costs for a candidate when an equally just demand could be made upon it to pay the balance of those costs. I am opposed to both of these proposed grants. I admit that it is exceedingly hard for candidates to be called upon to fight a second election through no fault of their own. Those things, however represent the fortunes of war which every candidate must be prepared to face. In the present state of the Commonwealth finances. I do not think that we should be justified in voting more money for the upkeep of parliamentarians, and that it is exactly what this proposal means. </para>

            <para>- I support the position taken up by the honorable member for Kennedy, and the leader of the Opposition, who has raised this question. Had the Government obtained theservicesof competent officers there would have&#39; been no necessity for a second election in the case of either of these candidates. Had the Returning Officer, in the case of the Riverina election, been endowed with the intelligence of a mediocrity, he would have allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chanter</inline> a recount. If he had done so, that gentleman would have been declared elected, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> would have saved his money. Instead of doing so, as the result, not of prejudice nor of bigotry, but of gross incompetence, he declared <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackwood</inline> elected by three or four votes, and then refused a re-count.  His  action is in striking contrast with that of the Returning Officer in the&#34; Darwin electorate, who allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BrickhilL</inline> my opponent, a re-count immediately he applied for it. The re-count resulted in a gain of nine or tenvotes for me. Yet I lost eighty-four votes consequent upon the incompetency of the Returning Officer at Penguin. He permitted forty-two persons to vote whose names were not upon the roll, and it is well known they voted against me, They actually boasted that if &#34;this Yankee,&#34; as they termed me, was defeated, I would return to America. </para>

The prejudice of some of these officers in Tasmania actually induced them to direct electors how they should vote. </para>

              <para>- I was returned to this House because I was able to defeat the hosts of ignorance. The ieturning officers for Melbourne and Riverina caused all this trouble, and the two gentlemen in question are entitled to be reimbursed their expenses. The same remark will also apply to the present representatives of the electorates of Melbourne ana Riverina. I am glad that the late Prime Minister had the courage to put this item on the Estimates, and I am sorry that he did not have the pluck to deal similarly with the other gentlemen I have named. </para>

While on this subject, I should like to say that I think the time has come for the re-appointment of an Elections and Qualifications .Committee to deal with all election appeals. It is far better that we should have such a tribunal than that an honorable member whose election is disputed should be called upon to go to the High Court. I visited that Court while an electoral case was being dealt with, and saw bewigged and gowned barristers and junior solicitors busily engaged in arguing whether two votes had been cast for a certain individual, or only one - whether an elector had put a cross opposite the name of a certain candidate, or merely a mark. The great High Court of Australia was engaged day after day on questions of this kind. </para>

            <para>- I do not agree with those honorable members who accuse the officers of the Electoral Department of incompetency, or something worse. This is not the time to indulge in generalities of that kind ; but I am strongly of opinion that where an election is voided on account of errors in the administration and through no fault df the person returned, he should not be mulcted in the ordinary expenses of the election. It may fairly be said that the two gentlemen in question were declared to be elected in the ordinary way, and I think it is only right that the Commonwealth should pay the costs incurred by candidates whose elections are voided through the default of officers of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I am not prepared to go so far as are some honorable members, and to say that the legal expenses incurred by an honorable member in contesting an appeal about his return - even if such an appeal is based on charges of neglect on the part of Commonwealth officers - should be paid by the State. We all have knowledge of many cases in which appeals have been made, and although such appeals have put successful candidates to considerable cost, I do not remember a case  in which a demand for reimbursement has been made. If we lay down the principle that the Commonwealth shall pay the legal expenses of members in cases when their election is challenged, we shall be called upon in many cases to make large payments. Such ft proposal would be a direct encouragement to a defeated candidate to take proceedings against his successful opponent. </para>

              <para>- But a person who had been declared duly elected might be put to costs amounting to &#163;500 in defending his seat. If it were known that in such circumstances the Parliament would pay the expenses of the successful candidate, 1 think that nearly every seat would be assailed in the law courts. For that reason I hold that we should not make any reimbursement in respect of law costs so incurred ; but I think that a candidate who is declared duly elected, and is subsequently dispossessed of his seat on the ground of some error on the part of the officers conducting the election, should be recompensed in respect of his election expenses. The Government should be asked to pay reasonable expenses, but I do not think that we should go any further. If we did we might open the door to litigation, and do more harm than good. </para>

              <para>- There is no doubt that errors must occur in connexion with every election, no matter how competent the officers may be who are employed to carrv it out. We must recollect that the last general elections were conducted under disadvantageous circumstances. There was great pressure as to time, and serious difficulties were encountered in preparing the rolls, whilst the officers had also to administer an entirely new system. In the circumstances I am not surprised that mistakes arose. I am satisfied, however, that nothing more serious than mistakes occurred, and that there was no desire on the part of any officer to do anything improper. Coming to the matter immediately under consideration, I feel that I have not been fairly treated: The principle involved is a new one so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. It is the first time, so far as I am aware, that any application has been made to the Government to deal with a matter of this kind. Had it been brought under our notice some months ago, as it might have been - seeing that these case&#39;s are some months old - the Cabinet would have had an opportunity to consider it and to deal with any application for repayment of expenses. At the first blush it seems reasonable that candidates should not be put to heavy expense as the result of a serious error made by a responsible officer, and that, if they are, they should be reimbursed by the Commonwealth. But we have to consider how far any step in that direction might lead us. When a matter of this kind is suddenly brought before a Minister in the House, it is impossible for his Government to at once give it that consideration which it should receive. If we were to adopt the course which has been suggested, we should create a precedent, and we know how precedents extend from time to time. It would be almost impossible to lay down any genera! rule; it will be for the Government of the day to deal with individual cases as they arise. In these circumstances I would ask honorable members to allow the item to pass, on the understanding that I shall bring the whole of the facts which have been mentioned before my colleagues. I have listened to the arguments that have been advanced, and I promise the Committee that the question, in all its bearings, will be discussed by the Government No doubt I shall ultimately have to submit Supplementary Estimates, and if the Government can see their way clear to affirm the principle which has been discussed - or to affirm it in a modified form - honorable members will then have an opportunity to declare their opinion in regard to the matter. I hope that honorable members will not persist in asking for a definite decision now. </para>

            <para>. - I think that the answer of the Treasurer is a very satisfactory one. I hope that the action taken in this case will not be regarded as establishing a practice. What is being done is being done not as a sympathetic act, but as an act of mere justice. But the Treasurer is right in saying that the Government of the day must deal with all these cases on their merits. Personally, I feel that the gentlemen concerned have suffered great injustice, though I agree with the Treasurer that we should not cast a slur upon the Electoral Department for what has happened, and that considering the area to be covered, and the rush of work, the Department did verv well. We must remember that the official? were all new to the work. They were not  treading the beaten track. Although I warmly advocate this proposal, I have no desire to rush it on the Government; but I hope that when it is fully considered by the Cabinet, the justice of recouping these gentlemen for the loss which they have sustained through the action of Government officials will be recognised. </para>

I have gathered, however, that there were many things in connexion with the gardens which were not attended to last year, owing to the limited amount at the disposal of those in charge of them. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking to the Treasurer so much as to the House Committee. I understand that assistance was required at a particular time of the year, and that it was not forthcoming. We have been treated generously by the State of Victoria in being allowed to occupy these premises, and we should therefore see that they are kept in as good repair as they were in when they came into our possession. I hope that the House Committee will in future give all the assistance that is necessary for the proper management of the gardens. </para>

            <para>- I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Kennedy. I know that the gardeners could not do all the work that was required to be done in the time when it should have been done. In gardening operations, as honorable members are aware, certain work must be performed at a certain time of the year, and if it is not done, it is impossible to repair the omission at some other season. Every one will agree that the gardener is an exceedingly capable man, and the House Committee should see that he receives all the assistance which is necessary. </para>

            <para>- There seems to be a little mystery about this bust of the first Governor-General. I believe that the history of it is that an energetic young artist thought that it would be a good thing to model a bust of the first Governor-  General. He did so. I believe that he invited the first Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, to go and look at his work. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> was so enchanted with the striking likeness that he asked what it would cost to have the bust sculptured in marble. A price was mentioned, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> agreed to purchase. But, I understand that only the clay modelling was done in Australia, and that the sculpturing was executed elsewhere. </para>

In the year 1898-9, 535 cases were tried, but in 1902-3 the number had increased to 1,269 cases. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; the items represent that total. No contract has actually been agreed to, because the arrangement made with the steam-ship company remains subject to Parliament voting the money. We should not make a contract binding honorable members until we had obtained the vote. Consequently this is a mere proposal to which we are not tied down until honorable members grant the increased amount. I do not think the Committee will have any difficulty in agreeing to the increased payment, when I mention what we shall get for it. We are very anxious to do something to retain our hold upon the Pacific Islands. Under the present very trying circumstances, we cannot do much, but one thing we can do is to encourage closer commercial relationship between the Islands and the Commonwealth. Most of our great colonial enterprises have had their beginning in the subsidizing of a trade route. For the additional  &#163;6,000  we propose to pay, we shall secure the introduction of two additional ocean-going steamers into the Island trade, in addition to the substitution of an ocean-going steamer for the present inter-island auxiliary vessel. </para>

I shall show honorable members the difference between what we obtain for the present subsidy of  &#163;6,000  and that which we shall secure under the new arrangement. The contract will include a service to the Solomon Islands, and we shall have ten trips per annum in lieu of six, and four of these trips will be made direct, instead of <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> a series of islands. </para>

              <para>- I have not brought the particulars with me, but they include copra, coffee, betel nuts, and other tropical produce. As to the New Hebrides, there is to be a monthly service to all  ports of the group, without transhipment, direct from Sydney, instead of <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. The existing service to Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands will be maintained without alteration, except that it will be carried on by a different vessel. Then as to the Gilbert and Ellice Groups, the service will be the same as at present. To the Marshall Islands quarterly trips will be made. Monthly trips will be made between the Commonwealth and New Guinea. </para>

              <para>- At present the trips are made every two months, so that instead of six trips a year there will be twelve. The introduction of two additional ocean-going steamers into the service will give increased facilities for intercourse between the Commonwealth and the Pacific Islands, and we think - and both our immediate predecessors in office agree - that we are making a good arrangement. Both the Deakin and the Watson Governments went very carefully into the matter, and they agree that we shall be getting the worth of our money. </para>

              <para>--There is a good deal more than cocoanuts or copra involved in this vote. To my mind it is essential that we should keep up communication with these islands. They are important to us from a strategical stand-point, and from a trade stand-point also there is much to be said in, favour of the proposed vote. Take the case of our own Dependency of New Guinea. For years past we have emphasized the importance of that Territory, and Queensland in particular has been most insistent in her action. This service will be of advantage to our relations with New Guinea quite as much as it will be to our relations with the islands of the Pacific. I trust, therefore, that the proposed vote will be agreed to. </para>

              <para>- I do not propose to now discuss that aspect of the matter. A very important investigation will shortly be conducted in reference to the tenure of land in these islands. That in- I vestigation will determine the nationality which is to populate them.

Before asking the House to sanction the payment of a large subsidy to this shipping company, 1 would urge the Prime Minister to await the result of the inquiry to which I have already alluded.&#39; What guarantee have we that this company will run the trips proposed, or that its vessels will not,, at a later stage, make deviations to suit themselves? We ought to have the agreement- before us before we are called upon to vote this money. Is Parliament to authorize, the payment of this large sum in complete ignorance of what we are to secure in return? I repeat, that we do not know whether these vessels will not, at particular seasons, make deviations to suit themselves. </para>

              <para>- The vote then was sufficient for the purpose to be fulfilled, but we found that the purpose was not sufficient. This proposal, although it will have an&#34; important bearing on the settlement of the New Hebrides, has a much larger scope. It provides for the Marshall, Gilbert, and Ellice groups, where British and Australiantraders are exposed to the serious competition of a German&#39; line of steamers. It will restore communication with Australia,, and tend to bring to us the trade withthe islands which we are losing, sinceit is now passing through German* lines northward, by their route of communication to Europe. For that reason, after going into the whole question very carefully with the representatives of the persons interested in the islands, and also with thePostal Department, with regard to the mail communication- </para>

              <para>- It was not accepted asgospel. I can assure the honorable member that the information was sifted. We had the advice of Captain Rason, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woodford,</inline> the Resident on the Solomon Islands, and other British officials, who,, quite apart from &#39; commercial considerations, could give us an independent judgment, and place their large knowledge at our disposal. I can tell the honorable- member that the amount asked for is no, <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> a very great deal, what the tenderers first proposed - their first proposal was much larger and more expensive. That amount was cut down to what was absolutelv necessary, and no more, and to what we were assured, on independent testimony, was a fair price. I believe the contract re- mains as it was drafted by me. It was next investigated by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney, when Minister of External Affairs, and also by the honorable member for Bland, who was the leader of the Government. </para>

              <para>- The item has since been criticised, and is now introduced by a third Government. I admit that it is late to enter upon a discussion, and I merely offer the independent testimony ofone whose dutyit was to study the matter, and who did study it to the best of his ability with all the knowledge at his command, when I assert that this is a reasonable and economical proposal likely to be more valuable to us than I attempt to explain. Even if it fails, it is an experiment worth trying, before the control and trade of these islands is transferred to other hands and other countries. </para>

            <para>- There an; two schools of thought on this question. There are those who are entirely against Australia having anything to do with any lands except Australia; there are also others who think it to be the duty of Australia to secure all the adjacent islands. So far as I am concerned, I think the true policy is to get as many as possible of those islands under the command of Australia. I strongly expressthat opinion, because I think it is the only safe course, in view of the fact that the predominant partner must have control sooner or later. We could import a great many side issues into this discussion. We might be told to let the fresh air of individualism work out the salvation of those islands, without any pampering by subsidies or other means. I believe, however, that a subsidy would be well spent, and my only regret is that. Sydney should be so constantly clung to as the natural port. Brisbane is the natural port for those &#34;islands, for very obvious reasons ; and as has been pointed out, Queensland was the first to see the necessity for obtaining control of them. Queensland annexed New Guinea when the home authorities had not the foresight to recognise the advantage of its possession. </para>

            <para>- I had the misfortune to be absent from the H6use this evening, when, I understand, the Prime Minister made a statement as to the business to be disposed of during the remainder of the session. In that statement, I am informed, the right honorable gentleman made some reference to the probability that the allimportant question of preferential trade could not be dealt with until next session. I should be extremely loth myself to adopt any such opinion. It may be, of course, that there are such divisions in the House that it would be difficult to arrive at anv thing like a unanimous conclusion without the expenditure of a considerable amount of time; but, in view of the situation, it appears to me that we should fail in our  duty if we did not at least make an effort to launch the question, and deal with it now if it be possible to arrive at anything like an agreement. I should have taken action much earlier but for the fact that the situation has been very unstable, because we have been discussing matters which necessarily have precedence, and also because while another motion on this subject is on the notice-paper I have been unable to frame such a motion as I would desire. I had hoped that to-day that motion would he brought forward - if it is intended to be brought forward - and disposed of. leaving a fair field for action on my part. </para>

              <para>- So I understand. It was because I had hoped that it would be disposed of that I have taken no action recently. I was loth to draft another proposal dealing with that part of the subject which has not been appropriated, so to speak, by the motion of which notice has been given, because such an action might have had the appearance of rivalry - and that is a policy which I particularly desire to avoid. The motion in question does not appear to me to be at all adequate, to the necessities of the situation, and I hope to have an opportunity during this session to submit what appears to me to be a sufficiently comprehensive and clear proposal in regard to this great national question. Its immense importance to us as a Commonwealth cannot be overestimated, &#34;and it is also of great importance to the mother country, and to the rest of the Empire. In spite of the fact that so much of the session has expired, in spite of the heavy burden which Ministers will have to bear in discharging the work they already have in hand, I feel that this question involves issues of such magnitude, that I shall venture to prefer a request to the Prime Minister - a request that he will not find it in his heart to refuse - that a proper opportunity be afforded the House to discuss it. Whatever the &#39;Prime Ministers personal views on the question may be, I think he will agree that the whole matter ought to be ventilated, and that at least some expression of opinion should be obtained from this Parliament during the present session. </para>

            <para>- My attention has been called to a report which appears in to-day&#39;s issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> of a debate which took place yesterday on a motion for the adjournment of the House, and which may give rise to some misapprehension. In the course of his remarks, the honorable and learned member for Indi said - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson</inline>(N.S.W.). - The race for thespoils. ft will readily be seen that the remark attributed to me is capable of an offensive construction. 1 do not say that I have been intentionally misreported; but I think that the interjection which I made was perhapsmisunderstood. I do not remember the exact words that I used ; but what I had in my mind was the jocular suggestion that it was a race for the Treasury benches on the part of certain honorable members. I had no intention whatever to say anything offensive in regard to any race of people, and I think it is well that I should take this opportunity to explain the matter. </para>

            <para>. - I think I stated some time ago that there would be no objectionon the part of the Government to give the honorable and learned member for Ballarat an opportunity to bring the question of preferential trade before the House during this session, and I certainly have no objection to that course being taken. I feel quite certain, however, that it would be impossible for us to adequately discussthe question under, at all events, a month, and, therefore, I do not see any prospect of dealing with it in a satisfactory way during the present session. I wish also to mention that, as honorable members know, the British Parliament has been in recess since August, and will not meet until the middle of February next. </para>

              <para>- It is singularly refreshing to learn from a statement made by my predecessor in office, that there is any idea that this is a matter of great urgency. So far as I am concerned, I have a particular personal wish that the, honorable and learned member for Ballarat should have an opportunity to make a statement of his views on this question in the House before the session ends, for my views on the subject will be published in a very prominent way in the mother country within the next  few weeks. Those views must not be looked upon as official, for they were expressed  before I came into office; but they are opinions which I still entertain, and I know that they will be published in such a way as to attract, at all events, some attention. I am very anxious indeed, as a matter of fairness to those who differ from me on this question, that the leader of the movement in Australia should have an opportunity to state fully the views which he holds upon it. I shall raise no difficulty at all as to the initiation of a discussion on this most important question by the honorable, and learned member, but I confess that at the present time, I do not see any reasonable prospect of bringing it to a conclusion. </para>
