            <para>- This is the old question with regard to the mode of arriving at the cost of the different Departments. The figures, as given by the Queensland Treasurer, are correct on a cash basis. But for the first year, the year before the Commonwealth took charge of the Departments, the figures given do not include a considerable amount of expenditure which was then paid out of other departmental moneys. The figures given for the two years, 1901-2 and 1902-3, include new works and buildings which were not included in the previous year&#39;s expenditure. The expenditure for 1900-1 is not included, but that was the year when the expenditure was really on the basis of the estimates of the State Government of Queensland and a year in which the expenditure had been very largely increased. The total as given by the Queensland Treasurer for 1900 is &#163;527,675. But the real cost of the Departments in that year was &#163;549,111. In 1901 the expenditure had increased to &#163;606,902 - a very considerable increase. The figures given for 1902 by the Queensland Treasurer are &#163;670,147, but the actual expenditure was &#163;598,654. That included a very large amount of arrears from the previous year. For 1903, the Queensland Treasurer states the expenditure was &#163;611,216, while the actual cost was &#163;567,8.17. I give the following detailed particulars in reply to the honorable member&#39;s question :  - </para>

            <para>- Before proceeding with the remarks which I have to make upon this measure, I desire to congratulate those who have preceded me upon the very able addresses they have delivered. It does not follow that I agree entirely, or in some cases at all, with the conclusions at which the speakers have arrived; but I can always appreciate a man who has the courage of his convictions, andIcan respect his opinions though I may differ from him. I do not intend to occupy a great deal of time in dealing with the Bill itself. But I wish to refer to a. few clauses to which so far no reference has been made, because I think it important that the attention of honorable members should be directed to them, so that in Committee we may be able to come to some better understanding as to what they mean. Before proceeding with my criticisms, I should like to say generally that I think the weakness of the Bill is in the limitation of the powers assumed. I refer to clause 85, because it is entirely new, and it has, so far, not been dealt with during this debate. It appears to me, that under this clause, in conjunction with certain clauses which precede and follow it, there is a danger not only that the stability of industrial organizations may be affected by this measure, but that&#39; the individuals who may come under its operation may also be injuriously affected. Honorable members will see that under the clause powers are given to trades unions to make certain rules, and to impose penalties as may be prescribed. In clause 90, power is given to organizations to recover fines and penalties, which may be imposed under the operation of rules adopted under the power given in clause 85. But, so far as I can see, there is nothing in the measure to determinewhat rules may be adopted. </para>

          <para class="block">He then goes on to say that this ought to be done within prescribed limits. I desirenow to refer to the interpretation clause which sets out the scope of this Bill I am surprised to find the limitation laid down in the definition given here of &#34;industry.&#34; I cannot understand thegrounds that can be advanced in justification for putting a foreign trading vessel on a better footing than a British vessel ; norcan I understand why the limitation is somuch greater, andthe power assumed is somuch less in this particular Bill than that, assumed in similar legislation which hasbeen passed elsewhere. I have before me theNew Zealand, Western Australian, and New South Wales Acts. In the definition clause of the New Zealand Act, which practically- sets out the scope of the measure, I find that every industry is included with the exception of what is here called the &#34; clerical industry.&#34; I was not previously aware that the term &#34;&#34;industry&#34; included those who are engaged in  a  clerical calling. The only persons exempted from the operation of the New Zealand Act are the State employes. </para>

The New South Wales Act covers the whole of the State employes, including those engaged (upon the tramways and railways, and its provisions also apply to seamen. In New Zealand the legislation extends to over-sea shipping, irrespective of whether it be British or foreign, so long as the vessels trade between the ports of that country. </para>

              <para>- No; but under the &#34;Seamen&#39;s Act. I look upon the definition -of the term &#34; industry &#34; in this Bill as the -one blemish upon it, and I am speaking as  a  friend of the measure. In no branch of industry is there  a  possibility of  a  greater strike -occurring than in the shipping industry, and it is impossible to foresee how far such  ian  occurrence may affect other industries. The very moment that such  a  catastrophe took place the labour which is associated with the wharfs throughout the Commonwealth would be affected. It is almost impossible, therefore, to forecast the extent to which other industries would be disturbed immediately  a  maritime strike occurred. I regret, therefore, that the .provisions of this Bill have not been made applicable to the whole of. the persons who are engaged in our coastal trade. In Germany and the United States foreign ships are prohibited from trading between port and port. If a similar provision were inserted in this Bill we should do only bare justice to the local ship-owners, who, according to the statement of the honorable member for Melbourne, pay their seamen three times the wages paid by foreign vessels with which they have to compete for our coastal trade. I do not  intend, however, to dwell upon that aspect of the case. I shall devote the remainder of my time to replying to the chief objections which have been urged against this measure. These may be summarized as follows : - First, that there is no necessity for such legislation, and that it has not been asked for ; secondly, that if legislation is passed it should be upon the voluntary principle ; and thirdly, that clause 65 constitutes an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject. Of course, that is the provision which deals with the question of the payment of a minimum wage, and enacts that a preference shall be extended to unionists. A further objection which has been urged against the Bill, both in this House and outside of it, is in opposition to the application of the principle of the &#34; common rule.&#34; It is declared that if the measure be passed it will have the effect of closing down industries and of driving capital out of the country. In support of that contention, it has been pointed out that in New Zealand, where a similar Act is in operation, the number of industrial disputes, instead of diminishing, is increasing: Finally, the opponents of the Bill declare that it constitutes a gross violation of State rights. Concerning the last objection, it is not for me as a layman to determine whether or not the measure invades State rights. In dismissing that objection, however, I would point out that, so far as the Bill may constitute an invasion of State rights, so far will it become a dead letter. The opponents of the measure have therefore no cause for apprehension upon that ground. In dealing with these objections the first point which presents itself to my mind is &#34;Have unions, irrespective of whether they are unions of employes or of employers, come to stay?&#34; To that question I think the answer will be a direct affirmative. The whole of the indications of the present age point to the fact that unions have come to stay. In every direction combinations, either of labour or of capital, of employ&#233;s or employers, are extending. These organizations now present an aspect which is distinctly different from that which was presented by them a few years ago. The question which we have to consider is, &#34;Are we to allow these two great forces which possess such potential power, either for good or for ill, to have unlimited control of industry, and to be in a position to bring disaster, not only upon themselves, but upon thousands of innocent people ? &#34; Are we to recognise the fact - and it is time that we did - that so long as the people enjoy educational facilities and liberty of speech, so long will combinations exist <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In my judgment we should treat these combinations in such a way that they will be powerless to inflict injury upon the community, and will be capable of conferring immense good. My experience of the operations of unions, which extends over a period of twenty years, teaches me that no large dispute ever takes place without affecting thousands of persons who are in no way responsible for it. Even the smallest dispute necessarily involves hundreds of persons innocent of any association with its origin. They are dragged into these conflicts chiefly by reason of the stubborn resistance of one or two employers. I think it was William Pitt who, when discussing an Arbitration Bill in the House of Commons many years ago, said that - </para>

              <para>- We have known such a thing to take place even in Australia. It may not be the manufacturer who is responsible in every case ; but it is generally an employer of some kind or other. In every instance a minority of employers are responsible for conflicts eventuating in strikes. The Shearers&#39; Union, with which the honorable member for Darling is so prominently associated, has time after time asked for a conference with the employers, in order that a satisfactory settlement of their troubles might be arrived at. I arranged conferences between the employers and the shearers&#39; in several parts of South Australia. I succeeded in inducing  some of the employers to meet the men and to arrive at an agreement for the timebeing ; but there were others who invariably stood out, and would not under any conditions meet the men. The same thing has occurred in connexion with many other trades. Efforts to secure the recognition of the principle of early closing, and to add to the comfort of the worker&#39;s, have time after time been frustrated by the action of a few selfish employers, who refuse to listen to the appeals of their fellows, and succeed in breaking down all agreements made between master and men. Prior to the passing of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in New Zealand, the great bulk of the employers in the boot trade agreed, after much trouble, to meet a large organization consisting- of the Bootmakers&#39; Union. A dispute had existed in the trade for a long time, but the conference ultimately adopted an agreement which appeared to be satisfactory to both parties. A few manufacturers, however, stood out from the conference. They declined to be bound by the decision of the majority, and, before long, so undermined the understanding which had been arrived at that another conference became necessary. I strongly favour the passing of a law for the settlement of these disputes, because I desirethat it should be beyond the power of. either employers or employes to bring about strikes with all their attendant disasters. It was truly said in this House a few days: ago that the party which emerges victoriousfrom a strike is often a very heavy loser. The mere fact that one side finds it necessary to give in does not always prove that its cause is a bad one. A strike is frequently brought to a termination because of the fact that the environment of one side compels thern to submit to the conditions imposed, while the other side perhaps possess extraordinary facilities to obtain labour to enable them to carry on for the time being. Whilea number of people favour the principle of conciliation and arbitration, they emphatically object to anything of a compulsory character in relation to it. They contend that it should be purely voluntary. The same argument was used in New Zealand prior to the passing of the Conciliation and Arbritation Act by the Legislature of thatcolony. I should like at this stage to quotef rom a work by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd,</inline> in which he deals, fully with this question as affecting NewZealand. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> went to that colony as one whg was not interested in any way with local disputes. He belonged to neither of the opposing factions, and went there eager to arrive at the true position of affairs. </para>

          <para class="block">The experience in New Zealand goes to show that the Government have had the cooperation of some of the best employers there, and that it is difficult to get anything like <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> body of employers to speak against this legislation. Something- has been said about the cost of administering .the New Zealand law, and it is therefore interesting to know that the actual cost for the four years in which the New Zealand Act had been in operation, by the end of 1899, was only &#163;4,400. The honorable member for Darling made reference to the cost of strikes. I do not intend to&#39; go into that question at length, but honorable members are aware that a very small strike costs an enormous amount of money -when its direct and indirect effects are reckoned up. It has been estimated by one authority that the direct loss from strikes amongst English-speaking people amounts each year to about &#163;12,000,000. There is another phase of the question with which I wish to deal briefly. It is frequently said that labour is a commodity, and, as such, is subject to the fluctuations of the market. I admit that labour is a commodity, but I do not admit that it is to be placed on the same footing as other commodities. </para>

This phase of the question is somewhat interesting when looked at in regard to the advantage which it is proposed by clause 65 to give to unionists. A number of employers object to that preference, because they think . that it will lead to an increase in the. number of trades unions. They speak as if trades unions, properly managed, were a detriment to society. I have before me an important work by Professor Ely upon the American labour question. In one of his articles he treats of the economic value of labour organizations. He shows, first of all, what trades unions are designed for. They are designed, he says, to protect the interests of the great mass of the working classes, and are intended primarily for the average man, not for extraordinary economic capacities. He then refers to a number of the fallacies of others who have written about what unions have done, and how they should be affected dr considered in connexion with the economic progress of any country. Time will not permit me to make as many quotations from the work as I should like, because it is of great interest, but he goes on to say - </para>

Then he points out that where the demand fails labour cannot be withdrawn like ordinary commodities. We know that the large industrial combines can not only withdraw their commodities, but by so doing can very materially increase the cost of living, although at the same time wages may be falling.

The difficulties in the way of arbitration have come chiefly from the side of the employers, for it is a rare thing when labourers refuse to arbitrate their difficulties with their employers. Few cases of such refusals have ever come under my notice. The pride and arrogance of men who do not like tomeet their employes on an equal footing havebeen the chief obstacles to a peaceful settlement of disputes which have arisen between capital and labour. </para>

          <para class="block">I heard one honorable member refer to the Broken Hill strike, which was also spoken of at a meeting at which I was invited tobe present, in South Australia, recently. It was pointed out that one of the greatest objections to the proposed legislation was the demand which it made upon &#39;the timeand attention of employers. It was stated that the officials of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company had been for some timeengaged in drawing up answers to thedemands made by the other side for increased wages. I do not wish to enter intothe merits of the case at present, but surely it must be evident to any one who will givea second&#39;s thought to the matter, that the present position is preferable tothat in which the company found itself&#34; during the great strike of 1891. Surely the advantage lies on the side of themore modern method of deciding disputes. In 1891 the whole State of South Australia was in a condition of excitement, and the strike &#39; had a disturbing influence over a great part of Australia. Is it not much better that the company&#39;s managers and officers should be, for a short time, taken away from their ordinary work to preparestatements and evidence for the Arbitral tion Court, than that the company should be subjected to the severe loss involved by a prolonged strike <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Common sense points to the new method of settlement as being by far the best. It has been urged that thelegislation now proposed is experimental. The right honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H. Reid, when he was criticising the provisions of the Bill and pointing out what he considered tobe its defects, declared that it was an. experiment, and I heard that statement sneeringly referred to as a very poor reason for supporting the measure. I would ask those honorable members who think that we should not try any such experiment if they have ever been behind, the scenes ? Have they taken part in any -conflicts between capital and labour ; have they seen the disastrous results - and I am now speaking from the workmen&#39;s standpoint - that always follow in the wake of a strike? The greater the strike the greater the trouble and suffering. Have those honorable members seen honest noble men practically torn asunder between their duty and their loyalty to their unions, and their duty to their families ? I have seen these things. When I was actively connected with labour organizations in the past, it often made my heart almost bleed to Iia ve to tel2 men that they must stand out, notwithstanding the great sacrifices they were making. We knew the conditions, but we had to ignore them as much as possible, in order that the principle at stake might be upheld. When the gaols have been emptied, and the </para>
          <para>Tiff-raff  of the cities have been collected at great expense by employers who desired to make use of them to fill the places of the strikers, and to defeat the unions, it has been most difficult for the best and noblest of the workmen to stand out for their principles. Under the proposal now before us, there will be no necessity for anything of that kind. I am prepared to admit that there will be many disputes, because they will continue to occur while labour and capital exist. But what we have to consider is how we can minimize the evils arising from such disputes, and to endeavour to settle them as peaceably as possible. I feel that we are standing almost on the threshold of a new era - an era that will form an important one in the history of the industrial movement. With other honourable members, I recognise that I am about to take part in placing upon our industrial structure what I choose to designate an emblem of peace. Looking back over the rugged pathway along which -this industrial movement has passed, I see that at times it was on the mountain of success, and at other times in the valley of despair. All. along the right side of this rugged track I note the numerous Acts that have been passed up to a comparatively short time ago for the suppression of industrial organizations. And on the other side of the track, as it presents itself to me in this panoramic view,  1  see the mounds that cover the remains of those who have been sacrifices to the cause. Here and there I see the finger posts which point to the men who sacrificed life and liberty to keep the light of unionism burning. It has been kept burning, and there is no power in existence that can extinguish it. I see in this vision the rise and fall of this movement from the time of that King who, building better than he knew, divided his people into companies according to their trades and professions. I see the progress of the movement in the early Christian era, and I trace it on until, at one time, I find it is considered to be not unbecoming for a King to be a member of a union or of a craft guild. I refer to the historical fact that King Edward III. was a member of the Linen Armourers&#39; Guild. Immediately after, notwithstanding the popularity of the movement at that time, we find the commodity of labour ill-used. Later, I see the scourge of the Black Death spreading across the land, and unsatisfied until it has carried off one- third of the population, and with the result that I see the first labour statute passed and the first conspiracy law that was ever introduced. I trace the movement further, and in my vision I see Henry VIII. confiscating the accumulations of years, and while I gaze, I can almost hear the troubles of the weavers. Then I am confronted by the Luddite rising. When I think of that, and compare the conditions then existing with present conditions, I cannot help reflecting that the natural offspring of oppression and tyranny is revolution and anarchy. A little further along the track I see a banner floating past emblazoned - &#34; Educate ! Educate ! &#34; I see following it another banner, on which is inscribed the magic word, &#34;Ballot-box,&#34; and immediately afterwards I find that some  3,000,000  of the workers have secured their political rights in the shape of votes. So on and on the movement proceeds until I arrive at the day when I find a deliberative assembly providing means for the purpose of preventing industrial disputes, and in my vision I can almost see the Judge, as he sits above the contending forces of the representatives of labour and of the employer. And, comparing this picture with that of &#39; tho past, I fail to understand how there can be any one desiring to oppose legislation having  for its object peace, the bringing of the combatants together, the amelioration and betterment, not only of the employ^ but of the employer, for undoubtedly peace in industrial life makes for the advantage of both interests. If we are able now to put the coping stone upon the industrial edifice it is because by virtue of their moral and numerical strength the labour unions are in a position to achieve for themselves by constitutional means their full social and political emancipation.

          <para>After a long weary pilgrimage, labour has emerged from the valley of the shadow of political death on to the broad plane of freedom, and now demands an equitable re-adjustment of the relations between itself and capital.

            <para>I think that all will allow that this measure is more far-reaching in its effect than any measure that has yet been brought before the Commonwealth Parliament. It. could not but be a matter of much regret for me to feel that, on the opposite side from where I stand, a large and probably an overwhelming majority is to be .found entirely against my views. But, added to that, one has always an uncomfortable feeling when not merely a majority of the House, but a majority of one&#39;s party, is absolutely opposed to one. However, I have a duty to perform, and under the circumstances, in an almost unanimous House, I am sure I shall have that consideration which I have always received when I have differed from honorable members since I have been a member of the Federal Parliament. There is another consideration which is also a little oppressive. Whether rightly or wrongly - I think wrongly - ina great com.munity like that of Australia, the industrial interests - those interests which, in so far as they are represented by those who have control of them are very badly represented in the Parliament of Australia. Whose fault that is, it is not for me to determine. I do not desire &#39; to see a Parliament representing any particular section, any particular view, or any particular creed. But I do say, seeingthat we are here as a representative assembly, that in the nature of things, as a matter of common sense, apart from the principles of representative government, those interests ought to be &#39; more directly represented than they are. Although I have never in my parliamentary &#34;career sat as the representative of any particular interest, I still feel that what I may say upon &#176; this question may be ascribed to a certain amount of class feeling, to the fact that I do represent in some degree capitalistic interests ; but I can honestly say that I have no partiality in these matters, for there is no class of industry in Australia which I donot in some way or another touch. I was led to this thought by a remark of theAttorneyGeneral. He has a quickness of imagination to which none of us can attain. He saw something in my face - I dp notknow whether it was a facial contortion which he interpreted to express dissent - but it gave him a text upon which to hang long sentences of farago. At the same time the genial member for Maranoa interjected, &#34; They do not like it.&#34;&#39; That interjection is based upon an assumption that all employers of labour are entirely opposed to this industrial proposal of the Government. I do not think that they all&#39; are. There is nobody so interested in illdustrial peace as is the business man. Nobody is so hard hit by industrial convulsions as are those who are engaged in mercantile pursuits. Certainly I have no reason to be taunted with political or selfish interests merely because I am -a Member of Parliament. Whoever, if he were an honest man, made anything out of being a Memberof Parliament <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Had I remained outside of&#39; Parliament during the past ten years whatever possessions I have would certainly havebeen ten times what they are. I say, notwithstanding what may be the opinions of labour representatives and ultra democrats^ that my one object in entering the publiclife of my adopted country is to do everything I can to alleviate the condition of thegreat masses of the people, to make industry run in its natural channels and topromote throughout the length and breadth of the land the welfare of the toilers of Australia. In dealing with this question apart from rhetoric and extreme views I desire to say that, considering all the circumstances, the industrial history of Australia, as compared with that of other countries, has been one of peace. True, we have had our strikes and our industrial troubles, but if we take that long, rugged road to which the honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> referred, and consider the peaceful triumphs of argument and conciliation, which have been won without any legislative coercion, I say they constitute a great triumph for the British people of this country. What about the eight hours movement? What about the general condition of the people of the Commonwealth from one end of it to the other ? &#39; The whole history of our industrial life in Australia is proof that there is no necessity for us to adopt these extreme acts of coercion. This is not n Bill to prevent strikes and to provide for conciliation. It is a Bill which will affect the daily habits as well as the industries of the people of Australia. Its title is a misnomer. Further, it is not a Bill based upon the understanding which was arrived at in the Convention which framed our Commonwealth Constitution. It is nothing of the kind, as I shall prove Later on. It is a Bill which is intended to supersede the States Acts upon the subject. Those who desire that the management of their own industrial affairs shall be taken out of the hands of&#39; the States wish to see it passed in order that all the industrial disputes of Australia may be brought under the Federal regis. That is the object of a large number of honorable members. Before dealing with the measure itself, I should like to refer to a few of the speeches that have been delivered in the course of this debate. One would think that upon a Bill of this character, which in its importance overshadows almost anything that has yet been submitted to this House, we should have had some statesmanlike deliverances setting forth conclusive reasons in its favour, giving us the experience in detail of other countries, and in some way or other supporting its very extreme proposals. But let me take the speech of the Attorney-General. He declared that this Bill is the result of Australian experience, while, on the other hand, the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> said that it constituted purely an experiment. Let me see how my honorable friend sustained his position. He sustained it by the following remarks regarding New Zealand : - </para>

          <para>His remarks are based upon a complete assumption which is covered by a perfect ocean of rhetoric, in which there is nothing to show that this experiment in the industrial life of the people, the end of which no man can see, and which, in essence, is entirely a socialistic movement - although it is not intended to be so by many of its advocates - is not a movement which absolutely destroys the liberty of the people of this country putting their daily habits and, in fact, the whole of their lives into the hands of one man.

Of the speech of the honorable and learned member for West Sydney I do not care to say much. It was certainly very vitriolic. But when an honorable </para>
          <para>Member indulges in this sort of language - We have permitted these people to go on until licence has ensued - what does it mean ? It means that a handful of Members of Parliament, newlyelected to this Chamber, and many of them men of very small experience, consider that they have a right - Parliament, of course, can do anything - to practically challenge and defy the whole system of our industrial life, which has built up this great country, and made their positions here possible. I have been in this country for the last thirty-four years, and knowing what has been done by the pioneers, the men who have risked everything - and capital has suffered asmuch as labour in this country - it seems to me to be a piece of audacity and presumption for any one to talk of these men, who have really made this community, being under the heel of a few- persons who happen to be for some little time Members of Parliament. Parliament is the highest tribunal of the country. I arn not going to belittle it, but I assert that it was never instituted to interfere with the industries of the people of a country. It was designed to make laws for the preservation of those industries - certainly not a law which would bring every industry under the heel of a Court of Arbitration. I should like for a moment or two to draw the attention of honorable members to the history of legislation of this kind in New South Wales. The New South Wales Act is of very recent date, and although it avoids those intermediate Boards of Conciliation which are a purely bogus institution in New Zealand, it is based to a large extent upon the law of that colony. </para>

              <para>- They do nothing but create warfare in the industrial life of New Zealand. They settle nothing. They result only in agitation. I have no doubt but that under that system thousands and thousands of people in hundreds of industries who previously were perfectly satisfied with their condition and worked without the slightest check or hindrance - an amicable feeling existing between them and their masters - became dissatisfied. As the outcome of that pernicious system, which is worse than the proposal now before us, there has been something worse than warfare and continual irritation going on in the industrial life of New Zealand.

          <para class="block">Every honorable member who has addressed himself to this question has said that anything is better than a strike. I agree that there are thousands of things that are better than a strike, but war is often better than peace. Have honorable members any reason to believe for one moment, that when this Court is in full force and is giving decisions from time to time, the bitterness betwen the parties will be anything less than that which is created by a strike ? I have not. The Arbitration Court emanated from the feeling which has become rampant in the political life of Australia that Parliament can do everything. We may depend upon it that when a law of this kind is passed in any State of Australia, and fails to effect the purpose for which it is designed, there will soon be cries to amend it. There is already a cry in New South Wales for the amendment of the State Act. The fact that awards are made and strikes are prevented by these Courts gives us no reason to hope either for immediate peace or the ultimate success of the system. I take it that we all desire to see the industries of Australia carried on upon common-sense lines, so that in every case capital will be continually increased, wear and tear made good, and the machinery necessary for manufacture renewed from time to time. There must be a fund which, in the first place, will pay capital for its use, and an added fund which will repair the waste and wear and tear in connexion with the work associated with industrial life. There must be a fund which will enable the machinery employed in the great competition of the world to be renewed from time to time, and which will, if necessary, absolutely recreate industrial conditions. T am very much afraid that we are dealing with this question largely from a provincial point of view. What is all this protectionist craze about ? It has but one object, with which free-traders agree, although we seek to achieve it in a different way. We all desire to see &#39; Australia a great industrial continent. We wish to see every possible manufacture set on foot here, and we desire, at the same time, a great primary production, which will give us the markets of the world. We must recollect, however, that although we <inline font-style="italic">ma,y</inline> make laws to meet certain conditions of our provincial life, we cannot, meet the competition of the world by any legislative act. We shall have to enter into competition with the world, and honorable members may take my word for it that the economics lying at the base of the present industrial system - unless they desire to destroy that system altogether - will force them against their will to take certain action. If this State interference goes on - if this control of our industries by one man works out the results actually anticipated - we shall find that Australia will have to become a second China, and take a secondary place among the nations of the world. I should like to draw attention to the spirit in which this Bill has been introduced. I should have thought that in framing this measure, the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> would deal with it very much like the Treasurer would deal with a Bill relating to banking. It has always been understood that in relation to every measure affecting very largely the practical life of the people - a measure which we may say is not purely one for lawyers - the Government as practical men invariably take the advice of those who are supposed to be experts, and those whose industries will be affected by it. Was that course followed in this case? We understand that not one individual who would naturally be opposed to this Bill ever received a copy of it, or had an interview with the Minister in reference to it. The right honorable gentleman has confessed that an exactly opposite course was followed by him. In the first instance a draft copy of the Bill was given to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper long before even the Parliament saw it, and whatever information was disclosed in relation to the measure was given to associations and people who were known to be favorable to it and absolutely hostle to other interests, kind ? According to the views of men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> and others who have given attention to these matters in Parliament, it is intended to divide the whole community into two warring camps. We must recollect that it is not designed to deal merely with large bodies of men - like the shearers and the men employed in the marine service - who may come into, conflict with their employers, but that it is an insidious mode of throwing the hand of the State upon every industry. What is&#39; going on in Sydney at the present time&#39;! We find that the time of the Court is engaged in an investigation relating to the wages of cooks in restaurants ; that a restaurant owner complains to the Court that the hotel keeper gives a free lunch with a glass of beer and is thus interfering with his industry, and that there is also a conflict of jurisdiction. The early-closing lawstipulates that a butcher, for example, carrying on business in Sydney, shall close his shop every Saturday at 10 p.m. We then find the Arbitration Court, which is presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cohen; deciding that he shall close his shop at 9 o&#39;clock in the evening. The man is naturally perplexed. He does not know what to do, .and applies for an injunction. We are now going to add to this double perplexity the further interference of a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Not only have we surrounded the industrial life of Australia with all sorts of irritating restrictions, which it was never intended, even by the most extreme advocate of this kind of legislation, to create, but we are about to set up a new Court, so that after a State Court has dealt with and decided an industrial dispute, it cannot be regarded as settled, because a little chicanery or subterfuge will make it appear a Commonwealth affair, and then the Commonwealth Court can be invoked to upset the judgment. Besides that there are further complications created by this fearful intrusion of the process of the law courts into the private affairs of the people, and at the present time the position in New South Wales has become so serious that the Court cannot overtake its work, so that, I believe, there are cases pending which it will take two years to hear. </para>

              <para>- But there is no strike on now. sir william Mcmillan.- That is no answer to my argument. Parliament must either be content to allow the work of the Court to fall into arrears, and to leave the community in a state of ferment, or it must appoint another Judge. If there are two Judges, how will their divergent opinions Joe reconciled ? We are only at the commencement of this experiment, and no one can foretell what the final result of it will be. . As a rule, i am not an alarmist, &#171;,nd do not take an extreme view in regard to the effect of Acts of Parliament upon the investment of capital. But honorable members must admit that if we pass legislation which is so difficult to administer that it leaves the whole industrial community in a state of ferment, upsets the businesses of hundreds of people, and creates general turmoil, the interests of the country must be injured. No place in the world requires the expenditure of capital from abroad more than does Australia. i should like here to refer to the three classes of people who favour legislation of this kind. They are what i call the opportunists, the peace-makers, and the socialists. i do not take account of a fourth class, who might&#39; be called the sudden converts, the appearance of whom we have recently witnessed in this House. Let me deal first with the opportunists. Legislation of this kind was first passed in New Zealand, and no one who has studied the public life of Australia during the last seven or eight years can fail to see that a large number of people and politicians is determined to seize upon and support, without regard to consequences, whatever they term in their clap-trap phraseology progressive movements. i read very carefully the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of the debates in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly upon the Bill introduced by the AttorneyGeneral of that State. Some of the ablest men in that House spoke of that Bill in terms of denunciation far beyond the capability of my vocabulary ; but there was no attempt to vote against the second reading. It seems to me that we have lost sight of the original constitutional meaning of the second reading of a Bill. The second reading is an affirmation of the principles of a measure. But, notwithstanding the denunciation of the New South Wales Bill, it was allowed to pass. A few able men spoke against it, and showed the dangers which it would produce, but two-thirds, if not threefourths, of the members voted for it without giving an opinion upon its provisions, and probably knowing very little about it. </para>

              <para>- No. It is often a good thing that honorable members do not give their opinions, because if they did it would be fatal to their reputation for intelligence. But are we to allow legislation like this to pass merely because it is termed progressive? Prom time to time we pass legislation which a few years ago would have been scouted. It is put forward as progressive legislation, and men who are afraid to be thought behind the times feel that they must vote for it. They see that the surface intention is good, and they give very little consideration to the probable effects. I believe that every member of this House who approves of the Bill before us belongs to the second class of those who are in favour of this legislation - the peace-makers. They think that it provides a means of preventing disastrous strikes- such as have been so heartbreaking in the past, and that such means should be adopted even at the risk of some injury to the industrial life of Australia. But many of those who hold that view - and I say this without want of respect for them - have not sufficient knowledge of the complicated questions affected. In my opinion this legislation will do what it was never intended by  its loudest advocates should be done. I am sure that even those who approve of its principles never intended that discontent should run riot throughout the industries of the country, petty as well as great ; but some of them have seen action taken in NewZealand, and lately in New South Wales. { which they must have regretted. And, as I have said, there is a third class - the socialists - who favour this legislation: I look upon  a Bill of this kind as another link in the great socialistic chain which has been forging in Australia for some years past. A process is going on - of which some are well aware, but in regard to which others have been duped - by which the inner life of every citizen is being disturbed by the operation of interfering laws and the vexatious application of the paraphernalia of the Courts. I do not desire to refer unnecessarily to free- . trade and protection, but there is no doubt that this class legislation is the corollary of the protectionist principle. It is certainly not the corollary of the free-trade principle, and therefore I hold that I am perfectly consistent as a free-trader in opposing the Bill. At the same time, I should not be consistent in anything if I thought my inconsistency would be likely to bring about beneficial results for my fellow creatures. This, however, is undoubtedly another of those movements by which the State gradually is taking control of the industrial affairs of the people. That principle has been openly avowed in this Chamber. We have been told with a great rhetorical flourish, and with a fine appearance of humanitarianism, which, no doubt, has been perfectly sincere, that the. time has come for another step forward in the march of civilization. I thought that when every man was granted the privilege of the vote, when education was made free and compulsory, and almost every restriction was taken off every human being, owing to- the action of the great Liberal party in England during the last century, our legislation in the future would be directed to promoting the progress of this great country, with its -boundless resources. But what are we asked to do now ? We are passing into another stage of civilization, in which the Parliament -of the country is practically expected to meet every difficulty of social and industrial life. Does any honorable member really believe that Parliament is fit to interfere in the management of industrial affairs ? We can do it only by delegation, and what must be the result of that delegation? What does the Bill provide ? If the AttorneyGeneral were here I should point to the Bill, with its 130 clauses, and the various provisions which are no doubt necessary to carry out its objects, and I should tell him what it all meant, lt means giving into the hands of one man - because the assessors are always partisans - the whole industrial life -of Australians. Is it to be supposed that one man, a lawyer, more than any other, could adjudicate upon all the complicated issues which would come before him in matters of this kind ? What power does the Bill give?

He will have the power to bring any industrial dispute within the scope of his adjudication, and to make a common rule, which may not be confined to the particular State in which the dispute has arisen, but extended to every State. Even though a common rule could not be extended, beyond one State, the power of the Court . would be enormous, in view of the vast areas of some of the States. If an isolated dispute occurred, involving a certain section of a certain trade, the Court might make a common rule which would apply to the same industry hundreds of miles away, and I think that when the Act comes into operation we shall have a lively time with the different States over this mode of interfering with them. </para>

There is no appeal from the decision of the Court except on a point of law, and there is practically no provision for review, because the Judge is not likely to do anything inconsistent with his own judgment.

              <para>- Only so far as a verdict may be obtained regarding a specific case arising out of the difficulties of the past. But no one ever heard of any Court being able to interfere with and to adjudicate upon affairs of industrial life the conditions of which might alter altogether within twelve months. I think that everyone will agree that no higher class of men has ever existed in any country than the Judges of our Supreme Court Benches. But what will the future have in store for us? If the whole industrial life of Australia is to become the subject of political scuffling ; if Parliament is to enunciate the principle that it can and will settle all these matters without regard to the extent to which it may, by so doing, interfere with human freedom ; if we depart more and more widely from the principles which have made the parliamentary system of England the first in the world, what will be the result ? Who will be our Judges ? We know that a great many of the appointments to-our Supreme Court Benches are of a political character, and no man can help being biased to a large extent by his political leanings. Is it to be pretended that some honorable and learned members who might be appointed to the Bench in the future and who might be capable of giving a sound opinion upon many questions of dry law, would be absolutely unprejudiced? Is it contended that the influence of politics would not make itself felt upon this tribunal in the future ? There are great dangers ahead, and I think that the public conscience - if there be any public conscience left - will be greatly tried by the decisions given. One decision was recently given in New South Wales which was utterly opposed to our ideas of human liberty, and if similar control is to be exercised in all industries, there will be no freedom in thecountry. In spite of all the eulogiums passed upon similar legislation in New Zealand, there is no freedom in that colony, because the Government dominate industrial life to an extent never before known in a British community. A system of espionage and tyranny exists there which no Englishman should ever be called upon to endure. </para>

              <para>- No, i stated that as a free-trader I was perfectly consistent in opposing the Bill, because my view is that Government should be confined to those duties which it is necessary for the State to perform, leaving all other matters to the intelligence of the individual. The intelligence that lias built up Australian civilization ought to be able to look after itself. How is it intended to deal with the varying conditions of industrial life if, for instance, a common rule is to made for a period of five years ? I know of an industry in New South Wales which came under the adjudication of the Arbitration Court in the State, and I can assure honorable members that owing to the loss of business, resulting from thedrought and other circumstances, the wholeof the features of the enterprise have been altered, and the settlement, which on theface of it was a very fair one twelve months ago, is now absolutely unfair. How is such  a case to be dealt with ? Then again, is the Court to be called upon by the labour organizations to insist upon conditions which are absolutely incompatible with the solvency of a business ? Because, whatever may be the minimum wage there is a point at which operations must come to an end. I am connected with an industry in New South Wales, in which for fifteen years we paid a living wage to our men without returning a single penny to any one but debenture holders. How can a Judge dictate to individuals regarding the wages to be paid in an enterprise in which money has to be set aside every year for depreciation, and for the payment of. a certain rate of interest upon a reasonable capital? The position of affairs, so far as profits are concerned, and also the element of insecurity, have to be taken into consideration. </para>

          <para class="block">Bo honorable members think, because soma settlements are being arrived at, that those settlements will not affect the future expenditure of capital ? &#34;We have heard nothing but a universal crow over the fact that settlements have been completed. Of course they have. The only alternative was for the employers to close their businesses, and people will carry on a very long time, hoping against hope, before they adopt that extreme course. But I can assure honorable members that settlements are now being effected in New South Wales which are absolutely ruinous to business, and if mutters in that State do not improve - I hope they will, but there are conditions which nobody can control - very serious loss will accrue, very heavy withdrawals of capital will follow, and there will be a very natural disinclination to invest money in the country. We have been told by some honorable members that the very fact that the Arbitration Court will be able to settle disputes and prevent strikes will give stability to capital. I do not think that honorable members who make th.it assertion understand the capitalist. If I were in England with a capital of &#163;100,000 or &#163;200,000, which I was asked to invest in Australia, and if I were told that not my Own managers, nor my own board, nor those who understood all the conditions of the business, but a High Court Judge, who might, or might not, be biased - because, although he might be as pure as any man in the community, he must necessarily have a limited knowledge of these things - was to be the arbitrator in regard to the conduct of my affairs, I should say &#34; No, I thank you.&#34; I think that every man of business would entertain the same feeling. This sort of humanitarianism which seems to lie at the bottom of these proposals is all well enough in its way. But to my mind there is a false humanitarism which may be very destructive, first to the industrial conditions upon which we are existing at the present time, and secondly, to the interests of the very people whose welfare we are endeavouring to conserve. But the insidious nature of this Bill, and the insidious character of the advocacy of it - which I fear more than anything else - is evidenced by the fact that up till a few years ago the workmen were fighting only for their rights. They were at perfect liberty to do so. Labour has a perfect right to get a fair price for its commodity, and I hope that it always will get that price. Those who were the strongest advocates of the working man believed in fair play between capital and labour. But the legislation which it is now proposed to enact - despite the statement of the honorable and learned member for West Sydney, to the effect that socialists are opposed to such legislation - is undoubtedly of a socialistic character, and the socialist does not meet the capitalist fairly, when questions between capital land labour are in the balance. He says - &#34;I want to destroy capital.&#34; If we pass this Bill I am convinced that before many years have passed we shall find that we have simply played into the hands of those who wish to take the control of all industrial enterprise from private individuals and to put it into the hands of the State. I have been struck once or twice by the wonderful magnanimity with which some of our legal friends enter into discussions of this character and advocate these highflown, humanitarian principles. They never suffer themselves. Some of the greatest advocates of this socialistic legislation are the barristers of Australia, who make &#163;3,000, &#163;4,000, &#163;5,000, and .16,000 a year, and who know perfectly well that it will not affect them. Moreover, I do not think that they are always the best judges of industrial conditions. I should like to say a few words upon another point which I have previously touched upon. What is the meaning of the provision in our Constitution which gives this Parliament power to legislate upon matters relating to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State ? As honorable members are aware, our Constitution is based upon the Constitution of the United States. We have no jurisdiction, except in those matters which are specially delegated to us under that Constitution. In the Convention, the question arose as to the desirableness of giving this Parliament power to legislate in reference to industrial disputes. I am sure that my colleagues in that Convention who may be present will agree that it was decided, after a long discussion, that all industrial disputes were practically matters within the control of the States Governments - that they were social, domestic matters which ought not to be dragged into the arena of the Commonwealth Parliament. But some delegates were of opinion that we should insert in the Constitution a provision by means of which, if occasion arose - I. suppose the seamen&#39;s and the shearers&#39; disputes were those most in the minds of members of the Convention - the parties to any trouble could be brought together and the matter dealt with as a whole. That limited power was intended to be exercised only as a last resort - there is not one word in the Constitution in reference to compulsory arbitration. </para>

As showing how farsome honorable members are prepared to go in their desire to ignore all principle whatever, they have actually declared that the word &#34; prevent,&#34; which is used in the. Constitution, shows that the Commonwealth can actually take cognisance of the brewing of an industrial dispute before it has cometo a head. To begin with, that is an absolute impossibility, because we cannot know that a dispute will occur until it has cometo a head, and in the next place those whoargue, like the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> that this Court has actually the right to decide, when a dispute is brewing, would actually giveaway the liberties of any people in any country. </para>

              <para>- I come now to one or two details in the discussion of which I have no desire to occupy any length of time. We have first Of all to consider the application of the common rule. In my opinion the power to make a common rule should not be placed in the hands of any man in a country like Australia. When we give to a Judge the power to make a common rule applicable to the whole of Australia, - and it is no answer to say that he will be a man of common sense, and so forth - we cannot blame him if he exercises it. In Australia we have such varied conditions, and such an enormous area to deal with, that in my opinion no man ought to be allowed to apply such a rule. It may give rise to the greatest amount of friction between the States and the Commonwealth Let us imagine that a dispute occurs in an industry which overlaps New South Wales and Victoria, and that a certain decision is given by the Court. Does the right honorable member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> say that in that case the common rule might be applied to Queensland <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

              <para>- Let us suppose that in such a case the common rule was applied to Queensland, where a local Judge under a simple mode of procedure had given a judgment dealing with the matters determined by the Commonwealth Court. What would happen if the two decisions differed? Does the right honorable member mean to tell me - and this is the time for us to consider this outrageous aspect of the question - that if there is a dispute between employ^ and employers in an industry in Victoria and New South Wales, which does not extend to Queensland, where both parties are working under a rule laid down by a local Court, the moment that dispute is settled by the Commonwealth Judge, he* can make a common rule which will extend to Queensland and interfere with the Statejurisdiction ? That is exactly what he contends. Those who argue that a Judgecan interfere before any real dispute hasoccurred and bring the powers of the Court into operation, and those who say that a common rule may be applied to a placein which there is no dispute and where theconditions may be absolutely different, are absolutely willing for the sake of their socialistic principles to stifle all the liberties of Australia. </para>

            <para>In New Zealand the same difficulty has been experienced. Applications were made for an award of the Court in the three large southerncentres of Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington. No such application caine from Auckland, withthe result that the Court made an award which affected each of these three large towns. </para>

          <para>The position in Auckland was that the employers and employes came to an industrial agreement without invoking the aid of the Court - an agreement under which the rates fixed were lowerthan those which the Court hod decided upon in the case of the towns mentioned. As the New Zealand Act applies to provincial districts, and not to the whole colony - </para>
          <para class="block">That is a very wide reservation - the Court could not alter the agreement entered into between the Auckland employers and employes, but it felt that, as the goods manufactured in that city entered into competition with those produced at the other centres, its only alternative was either to force the Auckland rates up a little, or to reduce those of Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington. </para>
          <para class="block">We have come to a peculiar position in the history of Australian legislation when it is proposed to pass a bill, one of the principles of which - and that principle has been carried out in New Zealand - is that when one particular set of employes and employers in a certain business disagree, and go to the Court, the Judge who deals with the matter may make an award which will apply to other communities where the employes and employers are perfectly satisfied with the existing condition of affairs, and between whom there has never been a murmur of dissension. The argument, I suppose, is that the Judge will use his common sense and refrain from the adoption of such a course. But this has actually occurred in New Zealand. Under this Bill the Court will be able, in the circumstances I have named, to say to men who were no parties to the dispute dealt with by it - &#34;Your employers are tyrants. We believe that the case of the other men is a good one, and although you have been perfectly satisfied, and although industrial peace has actually existed here, we apply this Gommon rule to you.&#34; Is that conciliation? </para>

              <para>- It is not. Industrial warfare is created in this way in certain districts and amongst certain people who were perfectly satisfied before this bogus legislation was passed. By giving these powers in the Bill, we inferentially declare that they shall be exercised. We practically direct that the Court shall exercise these powers, and that it shall make a common rule wherever it is possible to do so. Honorable members talk about strikes and industrial commotion, but no strike is equal to the injustice, tyranny, and degradation which, so far as many people are concerned, must ensue from this proposal. Underlying all this a great principle is involved - the principle of independence of mind, the leaning of individuals upon themselves ; the dissociation from improper Government interference of the multiform activities which have built up all the best industries of this country. This Bill enacts that a man&#39;s individual intelligence, character, experience, and money, properly expended shall no longer have due effect in his business dealings. Under a law of this kind a man may go on building up his business for ten years on lines that are perfectly satisfactory to himself and his employes ; but, as the result of a dispute in which he has had no concern, his whole business system may be disarranged in one moment. He may be compelled to alter the whole of his arrangements. There are various conditions which affect business. Consideration has to be paid first of all to the locality, the price of food, the rent charged, and many other things which make it far more expensive to live in one place than another. But the character of the employer, the mode in whichhe deals with his employes - his bonus or profit-sharing system - has also to be considered. There are all the conditions which arise from long employment in a certain business, with a certain amount of what one may call parental control, which to many men are often worth more than a rise of 5 per cent, in wages. But when this Bill comes into effect we shall destroy the very principle of conciliation, the very principle of mutualitj&#39;. We shall destroy that principle which causes a man to be, not a mere nigger-driver, but one who is sensitive as to his position, sensitive as to his responsibility, attached to his employes, and willing to treat them, not as a mere slavedriver would do, but as an intelligent person. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member knows nothing about this question. Under this Bill it is proposed to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> distinctly said he desired to see accomplished by the passing of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act. He said that he desired to create two industrial parties absolutely at war with one another, and then, because there was no freedom of contract on the part of the employ&#233; - seeing that the employer could wait whereas the employe could not - he desired to set them in two separate camps, as he has done, without any regard to those conditions which go to make up the decency and the humanitarianism of life. I shall give an instance of the difficulty of dealing with these &#39;matters at the present moment. Honorable members say that under this Bill disputes will often&#39; be settled by conciliation, without resort to arbitration. I deny it. Under this Bill there will be no conciliation. Our experience, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, is that the employes will always go to the Court, because they believe that they cannot do worse. They start, not in a fair position in which the Judge might say to them - &#34; You are perhaps receiving too much ;&#34; but just as in dozens of cases- </para>

The moment that the Arbitration Court is created the position will be just as it is under the States Conciliation and Arbitration Acts. Instead of matters being arranged by mutual agreement - and, in spite of the false rhetoric which we have heard very largely on this subject, that has been the case in connexion with innumerable businesses, and is still taking place - we shall have a Court- </para>

              <para>- i do not know. But I contend, now, that conciliation has gone. Awards made by the Court in New South Wales have, in some casas, given effect to proposals which were made long before by the employers. In one case an award gave effect to terms which were offered to employes, perhaps two or three years before. Honorable members may say, then, that the Court, at all events, settles the difficulty. We are replete with this sentiment in the Parliaments of Australia, - &#34;If you can obtain a thing by law why not get it.&#34; But the moment we bring a law into operation as between employers and employes we alter the whole position. We alter the mutual relations between the two parties. What will be the outcome of the passage of this Bill ? In many cases it will not result in benefit to the workmen or employe&#39;s. We shall find that the relationship between employers and employed will be brought down to the very lowest level by an adjustment of conditions in which a man&#39;s abilities and other circumstances, which the employer alone is capable of understanding, will be set aside. A fierce feeling of injustice will be created, and&#34; we shall find in the long run that, instead of there being that liberal encouragement which should be given to brains and experience, this law will in many respects react against the men themselves. Here we have a country now possessing absolute freedom, and with universal education. Every man has a reasonable education, and there is no position in. life to which a man with brains and a fair English education may not aspire. Some of our best men have graduated from the ranks, and, having taken their places amongst the masters of industry, are now leading both the industry and thought of the country. But what will this Bill do ? It will create two great camps. It will marshal the two great industrial forces oneagainst the other, as though they wereabsolutely antagonistic. It will put it intothe power of 100 men, when 400 of their fellows are perfectly satisfied with the conditions of their employment, to approach, the Court and say, &#34; We are a degraded: people ; we want our conditions altered.&#34;&#39; There might be 5,000 men employed in anindustry, 4,900 of whom were perfectly satisfied with their conditions ; but if the remaining 100 were dissatisfied, they could,, if I understand the provisions of theBill aright, create a disturbance, and,, by taking their employers and their fellow employes before the Court, throw the whole industry into a state of&#34; turmoil and unrest. Furthermore, we arefostering in this country the idea that nothing can be done except by Act of Parliament. We are making our labouring population feel that they have only to apply to Parliament to get anything they want that whenever they apply to Parliament they will get an Act which will do all that isnecessary to better their condition, and, which, if it is found not to quite suit, can be amended until it does. There is no rest and satisfaction to-day in New South Walesin any of the industries in connexion with which there has been adjudication by theArbitration Court. Furthermore, we areimplanting false and delusive hopes in the minds of the people. Legislation of this kind is part and parcel of the system of State interference with private industry, of which we have seen somuch in New South Wales, and which has resulted in molly-coddling and extravagance in public expenditure, until, the country has become crowded with. loafers, to the injury of the honest working man. I believe that nine-tenths of the working men of Australia are as fine a set of men as there are on the face of the earth. But there is a remnant of loafers, to whom the honorable member for Darling referred, who are eating out the heart of the ind ustrial life of the country. They crowd out towns and cities; but the&#39;real honest working men should have nothing to do with them. Honorable members apparently do not realize that in passing legislation of this kind, they are undermining the intelligence, the hardihood, the manliness of the working classes ; that they are sapping the love for improving their position and enjoying the results of that improvement which is the first effect of civilisation. This movement is the result of a wave of thought which brings everything to the Government and to Parliament to be set right. Instead of leaving us to pass the statutes which are necessary for the improvement of the country, and to place our people in a position in which they can freely meet the competition of the world, we have to spend half our time in the consideration of matters which are really outside our parliamentary duties. As a citizen of Australia, I do not look with any great hope to the prospects of the next twenty or thirty years. I believe that this rage for parliamentary interference, which has been produced by a false and exaggerated humanitarian feeling, will sooner or later have its reaction. But we should only hark back after a very bitter experience of the effects of our. legislation. Until that reaction comes, our industrial life will not improve, and our manhood will be unequal to that of the country from which we have sprung. I have not dealt with outside questions, such as the advisability of including seamen in the operation of the measure, in connexion with which the right honorable member for South Australia retired from the Ministry. </para>

              <para>- As a layman I cannot see much difference between dealing with the seamen in this Bill, or in a Navigation Bill. Whatever the difference may be, it appears to me to be the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. Remembering the country from which we come, and the fact that we live on an island continent, we should be very careful to prevent anything like provincialism in dealing with maritime affairs. We should be very careful that the facts are sufficiently big to warrant us in interfering before we take any step which will make the captain of a British vessel feel that when in Australian waters he is on what is practically a foreign coast. </para>

              <para>- I think it is not, Only a few thousands of pounds are taken from the pockets of individuals, but that money would not go into the pockets of Australian ship-owners if the thousands of people who now travel each year between Sydney and Melbourne by mail steamer for the sake of their health were obliged either to use the coastal boats or to go by rail, because they would choose to travel by rail. My right honorable friend&#39;s proposal will, however, hit Western Australia particularly hard. At a time when this House refuses to complete the transcontinental railway line - purely for financial reasons, because I believe that that line must ultimately be made - any policy which would isolate that great State is small-minded, and out of all proportion to the result that is hoped from it. The whole thing resolves itself into a matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and in my opinion the amount involved is not worth the trouble which it is proposed to take. The right honorable gentleman takes the same stand in regard to this matter that he has taken in regard to the fiscal question. If there were some small industry in Australia occupying ten persons, he would rather place a burden upon the whole Commonwealth for its maintenance than allow the people of Australia to purchase from the foreigner something which he could make much more cheaply and much better. </para>

              <para>- The people of Australia are now a Commonwealth, and a factor in the civilized world. We are part of the British Empire, and we cannot in legislation of this kind apply all our principles to their fullest logical extent.  It is in the interests of all parties to leave some loop-holes. I have taken up more time than it was my intention to occupy, and I do not suppose I have convinced many honorable members of the wisdom of  my position. I shall be asked - &#34;What is the alternative ? Is there anything worse than a strike?&#34; .My reply is that this legislation has been forced upon Australia before any alternative worth considering has been tried. In New South Wales there has never been an honest attempt to obtain industrial conciliation by mutual consent. With the wonderful buoyancy which is as characteristic of youthfulness in a people as in the individual, and with that love of experiment of which the right honorable member for South Australia is so prominent a champion, honorable members say - &#34;Why should we wait for the mother country ? Why should we not experiment for ourselves <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Why should we not do this, that, and the other <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> It would be well enough to experiment for ourselves if we had fair grounds for experimenting, or if the experiment were such that we could afterwards recede from it. But this is not an experiment from which we are likely to recede until there has been a very bitter tale told. We are experimenting with the industrial life of Australia. We are altering the principles upon which business has hitherto been conducted. The Bill has been so framed that, instead of merely allowing Commonwealth intervention in the case of a great strike like that of the seamen or the shearers, it allows a Commonwealth Court to practically snatch* away the jurisdiction of the States Courts. We are providing, not merely for the prevention, in the ordinary acceptance of the word, of strikes, but for carrying out a socialistic propaganda. Every industry in Australia will be brought before the Court, until the tribunal is completely glutted with work ; and the Judge will have no power to put one case aside to allow of the hearing of another. The result will be, I am afraid, that a very serious blow will be struck at private enterprise. We are entirely altering the relative position of employers and employes, and when disasters come, those who write om? history will have to say that this legislation was passed without proper consideration, and without real experience, at a time when the Commonwealth Parliament could very well have held its hands, and when the Commonwealth Government should have exercised prudence, and have safeguarded the interests of the people, instead of rushing into a rash experiment. </para>

            <para>- The speech of the honorable member for Wentworth has removed the debate beyond any danger of falling flat for want of point. In his wild and whirling denunciation of the Bill and its sponsors, there is material for half-a-dozen speeches in reply, therefore, X very much fear that in the short time at my disposal I shall not be able to answer half the objections raised. The honorable member claims to be representative of those who belong to the capitalistic class, and if his claim has a good foundation we may regard his speech as condensing all the arguments which can be used Against the proposals we are now debating. He has described the Bill as a coercive measure, as the result of the socialistic movement, as a measure calculated to destroy the liberties of the people of Australia, as designed to put their&#39; lives and businesses into the hands of one man, as destructive of all our cherished ideas of individual liberty, and also as exceeding the functions of parliamentary government. But we do not find very much to answer in those statements, because they contain no argument. They are mere words of condemnation, but at the same time they adequately represent a great deal of the opposition which has been expressed by those who, for reasons best known to themselves, are afraid of the Bill. Most of this fear is based not upon actual experience, but upon unreasoning distrust. The honorable member has expressed distrust of those who will constitute the Court. One would imagine that the gentlemen who in times past have constituted the judiciaries of Australia were absolutely unworthy, but the fact is that no courts in the world are so free from party bias, or so little disposed to do wrong, as are our own. No other judiciaries have such a splendid record. The honorable member delighted in the fact that our history  had been one long record of peace, and as there is no reason why we should not be as fortunate in the selection of the members of the Arbitration Court as in the appointment of our Judges it is to be presumed that the public will be as ready &#34;to peacefully submit to their awards as they have been to bow to the decisions of other courts. I was amused at the statement of the honorable member respecting the audacity and presumption of Members of Parliament in dealing with a question of this kind in view of what he termed their fugitive rights of existence here. We all recognise that Members of Parliament come and go, but the honorable member failed to appreciate the fact that Parliament itself goes on, and that there is nothing fugitive about its rights. Those rights are conferred by the people, and are exercised for their benefit. The right to legislate and the permanency of the legislation itself is not affected by the change in the personnel of the legislative body. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The honorable member further stated that the Conciliation Boards in New Zealand had proved to be bogus tribunals - that they had done nothing and settled nothing. Surely he must have forgotten that the shortcomings of the New Zealand system have been omitted from the&#39; Bill now before us. We know that the Conciliation Boards in New Zealand have not proved successful, and that they have resulted in obstruction rather than otherwise ; but we have been safeguarded against similar difficulties arising here by the proposal tq constitute a Court which shall discharge the double function of conciliation and arbitration. The honorable member&#39;s condemnation, therefore, applied not to the New Zealand Act, but to an incidental feature of the system. After all that has been done by means of legislation in New Zealand and New South Wales, and all the alleged dissatisfaction which has been caused, the most the honorable member can say is that there is a strong outcry for an amendment of the existing Acts. So far as I am aware, no one having any authority has at any time, or in any place, declared that the Acts should be abolished ; . but, on the contrary, the aim has been to improve them, and to increase the advantages which they already confer. It is all very well to say that alternative methods have not been considered. It was the duty of the honorable member to suggest them, but he failed to do so. The method of voluntary conciliation mentioned by him has proved almost absolutely useless for the settlement of great industrial disputes. As I shall show at a later stage, it has so many disadvantages that it must be abandoned in favour of the system now proposed, if we are to have industrial peace and progress. I have no desire to introduce what the honorable member terms the protectionist craze into this discussion, but I will say that&#39; he was perfectly right when he said that free-traders were logical in opposing legislation of this character. And I claim that protectionists are consistent in supporting legislation which aims at the improvement of the condition of all those who are engaged, whether as employers or employes, in industrial concerns. While we afford protection, through the Customs, to those who are conducting enterprises, it is our duty to look after the interests of those who work in the factories and shops, and until we have passed legislation such as that now before us, we shall not have completed our work in that direction. We have been told that what was required in this country was capital. I do not know that we require it any more than does any other country ; but what we do desire is that when capital has been invested, and people have opened up new industries, the conditions under which they are to carry on their business shall be settled. This desideratum cannot be secured so long as the right to strike exists, so long as individual employers can make bargains with individual workmen or so long as lock-outs can be resorted to to coerce workmen into accepting wages which are totally inadequate. I have no desire to keep capital out of the country ; but, on the contrary, I shall welcome every addition to our capital which is invested upon right lines. At the same time I see no advantages to be derived from the introduction of capital which may be utilized merely for the purpose of crushing labour or forcing it to accept unfair wages. The member for Wentworth was pleased to be a little facetious in regard to the sudden conversion of the honorable member for Melbourne. But he forgot to mention that the honorable member who recently led the Opposition, was also one of the principal opponents of the New South Wales Arbitration Act. That gentleman is a supporter of the Bill before us, and his sudden change of front is quite as remarkable as that of the other honorable member. Indeed, it is even more striking, for from an active opponent he has turned to an earnest advocate. The fact that individual liberty may in some sense be interfered with under the provisions of the Bill affords no warrant for destroying the measure. As the honorable member pointed out, we have already interfered to make education corn.pulsory, and if compulsory education be good as now applied, by a parity of reasoning, compulsory arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes should also operate for the benefit of the community. It is idle to say that we must not interfere with individual liberty or personal freedom. Individual liberty, in the twentieth century, is permissible only when it is consistent with the liberty of the people. When individual liberty interferes with the general well-being of the community it is time to interrupt its flow. Personal freedom, so far as it is consistent with peace and order, is an undoubted aid to civilization and progress, but when the honorable member for Wentworth declares thatin many cases, war is preferable to peace, I fail to understand his attitude. When heasserts that we must not interfere with individual liberty, and supports war rather than peace, he surely forgets that, so far asthe British race is concerned, war has always been their last resort, and that, when it hasbeen entered upon, their desire has been to bring it to as speedy a termination as possible. So it is with industrial war. As to theright of the State to intervene, have we not in the public interest already taken upon ourselves functions which even the honorable member himself will admit must bedischarged? Do we not insist upon freeand compulsory education, and that law and order shall be maintained in our public places <inline font-style="italic">1 Do</inline> we not regulate and determine the conditions under which almost every human function can be exercised ? In connexion with almost every industry there are laws and regulations which have to be obeyed. In almost every walk of life the State has already interfered with individual liberty. Further,., it is interesting to note in connexion with legislation of this kind that, as far back as 1884, a recommendation for the settlement of industrial disputes was madein Victoria, somewhat upon the lines proposed in this Bill. I was greatly interested in the remarks of the AttorneyGeneral regarding the efforts which havebeen made in this direction by the right honorable member for South Australia,. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pember</inline> Reeves, and others.

              <para>- The fact that itwas not carried out has no bearing upon my argument. I merely cite it here for its- historical value. The present AttorneyGeneral was a member of that Commission, as were also two ex-Premiers of Victoria. As a matter of fact, that recommendation was the first of a series which eventually led up to the passing of the Factories Act in this State. That Act is in large part a very good substitute for the kind of legislation which is now proposed. The idea underlying it is exactly the same, although the method of applying it i? somewhat different. But, though I strongly support this class of legislation, I entertain grave doubt as to whether it will prove as beneficial to the labouring classes as most of them hope. I am inclined to think that, in accepting this principle, labour is making a greater sacrifice than those upon the opposite side realize. In the long run it may probably be found that those who will chiefly benefit by this legislation are the employers. Personally, I hope that both sides will receive justice at the hands of the Court, and that, as a result, we shall have order, safety, and progress in respect of our commercial affairs. The honorable member for Wentworth declared that the solvency of our businesses was of more importance than an award under the industrial legislation proposed. </para>

Naturally the Court will take into consideration every circumstance surrounding an award, and limit its application .to a proper period.

          <para class="block">Similarly it would be better if a number of employers who are engaged in sweating their employe&#39;s went out of business, rather than that they should remain in it and continue the practice. Prior to the institution of the Factories Act in Victoria I recollect that there were a number of individuals who, as journeymen in different trades, were able to earn good wages. Having saved a few pounds,, many of these entered into business for themselves. On their own account they were quite willing to accept less than they had received as employes, and consequently they forced the honest employer, who was willing to pay fair  wages, to make reductions in the wages of his workmen which otherwise he would not have made. Upon the passing of the Act, however, these individuals, being forced to pay the proper rates where they had any one employed, were in many instances compelled to relinquish their businesses and to accept employment once more as journeymen, with the result that in most cases they are now very much better off. </para>

              <para>- The insurance required by the ordinary man before he enters into business is a sufficient capital, together with the knowledge that is necessary to enable him to compete successfully. The honorable member for Wentworth affirms that if this Bill be carried, there will be no such thing as financial stability. What is the case elsewhere? In New Zealand, instead of financial stability having been shaken by the operation of similar legislation, it has been augmented. The bank deposits areincreasing every year, despite the fact that the country has had an Arbitration Act in force longer than has any of these States. In Western Australia, where a similar Act is operating^ capital is increasing, commerce progressing, and industry flourishing. As a matter of fact, we have in Victoria to-day a Government of the very type of which the honorable member for Wentworth approves. Yet it has failed to effectually stop the exodus of population from this State, &#91;n fact, during its tenure of office, there has been a greater loss of population than at any time previously. Where are the people who are leaving Victoria going ? To those two countries where this so-called socialistic legislation is in full swing, namely, to New Zealand and Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- It is true that many Sire going to South Africa because of the prosperity which that country is enjoying by reason of the large expenditure of loan moneys. But a good many people are leaving Victoria for Western Australia and New Zealand, where legislation similar to that which is now proposed is in active operation. As already stated, I find from the Year Book of New Zealand that between 1894 and 1901 there was an average annual increase in the population of 15,000. The total population of that country to-day is 787,600. Taking the same years, I find that the population of Western Australia has. increased by 13,000 annually. If the statement of the honorable member for Wentworth is correct, how is it that the two countries where this legislation has been longest in operation are the most progressive, that population is flowing to them, and that  increased capital is being invested there <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

              <para>- I think the relationship is too obvious to call for any reply to the honorable and learned member&#39;s interjection. So far as this class of legislation in Victoria is concerned, the Factories Act does not apply to the country districts. But, notwithstanding that fact, people are leaving the rural districts for New Zealand and Western Australia. The Factories Act does not apply to the miner or the&#39;farmer in this State, nor to a large number of people engaged in various occupations in the country, but even making a liberal allowance for the disastrous effects of the drought - which was not so severely felt in Victoria as in some of the otherStates of the Commonwealth - we know that a number of persons are leaving the provinces of Victoria for New Zealand and West Australia. They are leaving because they know that they can do better in those places, despite what the honorable member for Wentworth has said as to the destructive character of legislation of this kind. </para>

              <para>- Then I have been misinformed. If it does apply to the farming industry, the fact gives even stronger support to my argument. In any case the Factories Act of Victoria does not apply to miners yet they are leaving this State for Western Australia where the Arbitration Act does so apply. The last point I wish to make in regard to this matter is that in spite of the conditions which are in operation in Victoria with respect to the government of the people, there has been a distinct increase in the number of persons engaged in trades affected by the Wages Boards. Speaking from memory, and subject to correction, I believe that last year there was an increase of 3,000 in the number of persons employed in trades affected by the Victorian Factories Act. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. If it be true, as the honorable, member for Wentworth asserts, that legislation of this character destroys trade, is it not strange that in Victoria where factory legislation has been in force for some time there has been an increase in the number of workers, and an actual increase in the output of the various trades ; that in New South Wales, where we have legislation of this kind in operation, there has been an increase in trade, capital, and in the number of persons employed, and that in Western Australia, where there is also a Con: ciliation and Arbitration Act in force, all three conditions obtain. </para>

I am about to mention, and I desire to pay him the courtesy of this acknowledgment.We are told that those who are affected by adverse awards of the Conciliation Court refuse to abide by them. But it is not so long ago, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that some 15,000 miners in Western Australia, threatened to strike for better conditions of employment. The Act in operation theremade it possible for a Court of three Commissioners to take into consideration all the circumstances affecting their case, and, asthe result of what was graphically described as the meeting of three men in an iron shed on the Coolgardie gold-field, 15,000 men, without leaving their work, obtained an award which altered the whole scale of&#34; wages paid. In a great number of instances the award reduced the rates of pay, whileit increased them in others. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member looks up the facts he will find that the mining company which was principally affected - I believe it is known as the Great Boulder - paid a very high dividend immediately afterwards. The  chairman  of &#39; directors, in addressing the shareholders in London, said he was pleased to be able to announce that the usual dividend would be paid, and at a later stage he expressed regret that the company could not increase  the dividend - which I believe was equal to something like 22 per cent. - becauseof the socialistic legislation in Australia, which controlled the wages paid to their men.- </para>

              <para>- In this case 15,000 men were able to arrive at a settle-- ment of their difficulty without any loss of employment, without resort to a &#39;strike, and without any loss of capital. One fact of that kind is worth a ton of the vituperation which the honorable member for Wentworth heaped upon this Bill. The honorable member severely attacked the measure without adducing any facts in support of his assertions. We are discovering in these modern times that compulsion is necessary in almost every walk of life, and in a matter of this kind it is so essential that we cannot leave it out of consideration. Voluntary settlements- have been and are likely to be failures everywhere. They must fail in the nature of things. Let me refer again for a moment to the Victorian Factories Act as furnishing a case in point. Some time ago the Act was amended, a provision being inserted that a decision given by a Wages Board should have no force unless it were the award of a seven-tenths majority. The effect of the Act first of all is that it compels a conference of employers -and employes, and it suggests a voluntary settlement, because the seven-tenths provision is so unworkable that it can only be regarded in that light. The Act says in effect to the parties - &#34; Unless you can arrive at a voluntary argreement you can obtain no settlement of your dispute.&#34; As the result of that voluntary condition of affairs in relation to some of these Wages Boards, no determination has been arrived at. Thus, from practical experience, we see that the voluntary system  of conciliation will not work, and that compulsion must be introduced into these matters. I sympathize with the honorable member for Wentworths desire for liberty and personal freedom. W e are all bound to worship at that shrine, but we are -also bound to recognise that industrial peace and commercial progress are of vastly more moment to the community than is the right of an individual to conduct himself as he pleases as against the wishes of the great body of the people. Recognising that the good of the individual is embraced in the proposition which provides for the  good of the whole, we have, therefore, to resort to a class of legislation which will secure that end. I contend that the best results for all parties are to be obtained by resorting to the compulsory system of conciliation. On this topic the Lord Bishop  of Hereford some time ago instituted a very interesting discussion by a letter to the London <inline font-style="italic">Times.</inline> Its publication gave rise to a great deal of correspondence on the part of eminent public men and parliamentarians. Some of them were strongly opposed to the application of compulsion <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the principle of arbitration. Others supported it in part, while others again were neither in favour of or against it, but expressed a desire for some system to settle industrial disputes. In reply to all the criticisms with regard to compulsory arbitration, and summing up the correspondence generally, the Lord Bishop of Hereford said in a letter dated 6th January, 1899 - </para>

          <para>I ask that the same state of things shall apply to the conditions of Australian trade and commerce ; that the men of the Court shall be of pre-eminent ability, highly trained for the work, beyond suspicion of prejudice or passion, and able to give judgments satisfactory to the people&#39;s sense of justice, and calculated to meet the needs of those who come before the tribunal. Other critics assert that there is no need for a measure of this kind ; that America, has found no necessity for it. That is true in part, but it is also true that whilst the people of the United States of America have not yet resorted to any considerable extent to the system of compulsory arbitration, the trend of legislation there is now in that direction. Unfortunately, there is among the American people a mistrust of their J Judiciary such as does not exist in any other Englishspeaking community. I do not say that the Americans consider their Judges venal, or expect to get from their Courts decisions which might be called purchased verdicts, but they have an unmistakable mistrust of them. </para>

              <para>- I am speaking chiefly of the Courts of the States ; but the same feeling exists in some degree with regard to the Federal Courts. Becuase of the existence of this feeling, the great mass of the people of America are unwilling to trust their industrial liberties to the Courts. But that is not the case here. As the result of their unwillingness to trust their affairs to the Courts, the Americans have engaged in what might be called committee bargaining. But the bargains are so short-lived that there is a constant danger of strikes, locks-out, and other industrial conflicts. If we take the evidence of men like Samuel Gompers, the  President  of the American Federation of Labour, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marcus</inline> Hanna, we find that these committee bargains are constantly being made for such short periods as six months. At the end of that time new agreements have to be entered into. Luckily, for some years past, the state of trade and commerce in America has been such that up to the present time they have been able to continue this system with great satisfaction. That their trade is so brisk is due to the wonderful natural endowments of the country, its immense progress and prosperity under protection, and the vast influx of population which is continually taking place. But those conditions do not obtain in Australia, and, therefore, what has been found to act well to a certain extent in America cannot be expected to act well here. Therefore we must frame somewhat different legislation to meet our case. But even in America they have found it expedient in some of the States to provide for what may be called compulsory arbitration. In proof I propose to quote now from a book entitled &#34; <inline font-style="italic">Questions of the Day - Industrial Conciliation - Report qf the Conference of the National Civic Federation.&#34;</inline> The  speaker,  whose words I shall read, is the Honorable R. S. Taylor.

            <para>The law provides for the appointment by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, of two labour commissioners - one from the employing interest and the other from the labour interest, not less than forty years old, and not of the same political party. It is the duty of these commissioners, upon receiving information of any strike, lock-out, boycott or other labour complication in the State affecting the employment, of fifty persons or more, to go at once to the place and exert themselves (1 1 to adjust the controversy by conciliation; (2) if that effort should be ineffectual, to endeavour to induce the parties to submit their differences to arbitration ; and (3) if that should be unsuccessful, after a lapse of five days, to investigate the facts with or without the consent of the parties. For arbitration, the law provides a board consisting of the two labour commissioners and the Circuit Judge within whose circuit the controversy is located. To these the parties may,, if they choose, add an additional arbitrator each, making in that case five in all. The judge is thepresident of the board, and the proceedings are. conducted according to the rules of civil trials. The finding of the board is spread on the record of the Circuit Court, .and has the effect of a. judicial Order. Upon complaint of either party that the other is not obeying the order, a rule to. show cause is issued by the Court, upon which proceedings are had, as in other orders, <inline font-style="italic">in personam.</inline> These provisions invest the board with full judicial authority, and vest in the Court power to compel obedience to the award in any suitable manner. </para>

          <para class="block">Court is almost the same as that provided for by the Bill. The  speaker  went on to show that hundreds of. cases had been investigated, and that thousands of persons had been interested in the verdicts given, but that, so far - and he covered a period of three years - the results had been extremely satisfactory, and there was no desire to alter the law. I wish now to say a few words with respect to the fallacies underlying the advocacy of the voluntary system. In the first place, I would remind the honorable member for Wentworth and those who hold similar views, that the initial difficulty of getting the parties to a dispute to come together is greater than most people imagine it to be. For a number of years I have been a member of the Victorian Antisweating League, of which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is the Secretary, That league, both before and since the Factories Act was passed, has acted as a kind of public mediator. The phrase may appear a large one, but I think it conveys the idea which I wish honorable members to have. The ladies and gentlemen who compose the league, who have no other cause to serve than the promotion of industrial peace, interest themselves in endeavouring to bring employers and employed together, in order to obtain the satisfactory settlement of disputes. Before the Act was passed, however, we found that it was almost impossible to do anything. After the Act was passed, breaches of the law constantly occurred, and the league was frequently appealed to to get employers - I regret to say that it was always the employers who were offenders - to conform to the law. In many cases we were successful in inducing them, either by threats, or by more suave action, to do what the law said they should do. But, prior to the passing of the Act, it was utterly impossible to get them to agree to fair conditions. Afterwards, when they could be threatened, they invariably gave way. That fact proves the difficulty of bringing parties together in the absence of any compelling power. If the experience of the Anti-sweating League can be taken as a guide as to the manner in which industrial disputes will be settled under this measure, we may regard it as certain that it is the conciliation provisions which will be most often brought into requisition, while the arbitration provisions will scarcely be used at all. The fact that the parties will know that if they do not agree to a friendly settlement they will be compelled to go toarbitration will nearly always lead to the end we have in view. </para>

              <para>- I know that the. principle of fixing wages is probably 300 or 400 years old. Under the old&#39;. English guild system efforts of this kind were constantly made. In some cases they failed, and in many cases they were abandoned. But the world has moved since then.. The conditions of modern society differ sovastly from the conditions which prevailed_ some centuries ago that we wantnew methods. The second difficulty with regard to voluntary agreements is that when you have brought the parties together you cannot always get them to agree, and if they do agree they may, and very often do, as the agreement is not binding, violate it at any time. The next objection to voluntary agreements is that they affect only the parties who make them. There cannot be such a thing as a common rule under the voluntary system. One employer may be got to agree to do something, which is fair to his employes and not unfair to himself, but next day some unscrupulous rival may so cut into his business, and reduce his profits, as to make it impossible for him to keep his bargain. The result is constantly recurring trouble, and no definite settlement. &#34;What we de-&#39; sire is perpetual peace, if such a thing can be obtained. If we can get it by means of voluntary agreements, so much the better ; but I fear we shall require to use othermeans to obtain it. Once an agreement. which is satisfactory to both parties has been-, entered into, no third person should, byreason of his competition, be able to causeone of the parties to break it. Under thevoluntary system, however, this is not. possible, for there can be no control&#39; of the sweater. What we want is a measure which will get at the sweater and compel him, as well as the honest man, to submit to proper conditions. If it does not&#39; control the sweater, our legislation will be of no service at all. If, however, it does control him, it will set up a condition of things such as the Victorian Factories Act has set up. It will weed out employers who have insufficient capital, will compel those who are over-avaricious to satisfy the reasonable demands of their employes, and will put employers and employes on a more certain footing. The honorable member for Wentworth said that lie expected to be asked to suggest an alternative to compulsory conciliation and arbitration, and the alternative he suggested was voluntary conciliation. I have endeavoured to show that that is utterly impossible under the existing state of things, and is foredoomed &#39;to failure. This being so, I think we <inline font-style="italic">ave</inline> justified in attempting, in the words of the right honorable member for East Sydney, this daring experiment. We are justified, too, by the experience of New Zealand and Western Australia. That experience shows that industrial peace makes for industrial progress, and industrial progress makes for conditions of happiness, and all that pertains to proper modes of living. What we have to ask ourselves is, not which is the stronger party, but what party in the last resort bears the burden <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have also to ask ourselves why, if the State asserts its rights in other matters, it should not interfere here, and, to use the expression of the Lord Bishop of Hereford, speak the last word in the settlement of a dispute affecting the public at large as well as the immediate parties to it ? If I rightly read the Bill, the  President  of the Court will be a Justice of the High Court, and will be in very fact a public mediator. Unlike the Anti-sweating League to which I have alluded, he will have such power and authority as will give him a right to interfere which is not vested in any other person. It will be his duty, as well as his privilege, to intervene at any stage of industrial strife, to prevent locks-out or strikes. The intervention pf the Arbitration Court will not be needed if locks-out and strikes are prevented. Before a dispute reaches that stage, the  President  will be able, on his own initiative, to interfere, and alone and unaided, try to bring the parties together by conciliatory methods. If my interpretation of the Bill is correct, I am right in assuming that, in probably 80 per cent, of the cases, the  President  having so intervened will have brought the parties together, and by his own good offices entirely overcome the necessity for resorting to arbitration. </para>

              <para>- There is no other view to take if my contention be correct. The Court will not enforce unfair terms. It will not arbitrarily compel an employer to pay rates of wages irrespective of the circumstances of his business. It&#39; will not impose conditions which will force men out of business if they are willing to pay fair rates of wages. </para>

              <para>- The Court will consist of impartial men eager to do justice. It will be a public tribunal, constituted in the public interest and bound in honour and good conscience to preserve the industrial peace. Its chief function will be to step between the parties and, on behalf of the public at large, endeavour to prevent great industrial disputes such as have set half the people of a State by the ears and have reduced thousands of people to destitution. I am sure that the honorable member must agree that it would be better to settle industrial difficulties peacefully rather than to have the whole community upset by industrial strife. If, however, the  President  of the Court has the power to act as a public mediator, the Court will not often be called into requisition, and those consequences which honorable members who are opposed to the Bill appear to view with apprehension will never be in evidence. At the same time I am inclined to think that it would be better if the three members of the Cou.i;t were all t rained to the law. The Attorney-General said that the reason why the lay members of the Court, as distinguished from the  President,  were to have seven years&#39; tenure of office was because it was desired to place them beyond the suspicion of bias. The right honorable G. H. Reid Said that later on the decisions of the Court might be questioned because of the bias displayed by some of its members. The honorable member for Dalley said that the Conciliation Boards of New Zealand were partisan Boards, and the honorable member for Wentworth asserted positively that the Court would be biased, and that practically every decision would be given by one man. </para>

              <para>- I hope that it will not be the experience in connexion with the Bill. Because I hope so I do not intend to oppose any of the provisions of this measure, but I am afraid that the expressions used by the honorable members referred to may be repeated by those who are adversely affected bv the decisions of the Court, and that bias may be attributed to it. If we had a Court constituted of Judges such as those who sit on our Supreme Court Benches, we should place the tribunal beyond suspicion and should insure the highest respect for its decisions. I believe that there will be very little need for the Court as an arbitration tribunal,&#39; because the conciliatory efforts of the  President,  with the force of the law behind him, will prove so effectual that there will be no need, except in a very few instances, to refer matters to arbitration. We may, therefore, look for the triumph of this legislation rather than for that dismal failure which some of its opponents forecast, and which some of them hope for in order that effect may be given to their petty theories regarding the importance of individual liberty, even though that liberty may operate against the interests of the great mass of the people whose concern it is that industrial peace shall be preserved and that our progress and. prosperity as -a community shall not be retarded by industrial strife. </para>

              <para>- A very great&#39; authority has written that a man sees what he brings eyes capable of seeing, but in this case we require to bring, not only capable eyes, but willing eyes. I should like to say that I have never regarded conciliation and arbitration with any hostility. When I was a candidate for election to the State Parliament in 1892, I made a reference to the subject in the speeches which I addressed to the elector?. I notice that the honorable member for Bland said that many honorable members came here pledged to support a particular line of action in regard to the Bill. So far as I am concerned I neither spoke upon the subject myself, nor did I ever hear it mentioned during the whole course of the Federal campaign. Doubtless this was because it was then thought to be beyond the immediate range of Federal politics. </para>

There was then published in the <inline font-style="italic">Nineteenth Century</inline> a description of the idea, and I furnished this to the  president  of the Pastoralists Association in Victoria, suggesting at the same time to the secretary of the Association that something should be done in this way. The proposal now before us, which is the outcome of the Trades Hall and the Chamber of Commerce, is on a similar basis, and is of a good, workable nature. </para>

            <para>Conciliation boards and arbitration boards on which both parties in the dispute are represented, and which consist of men in whose judicial qualities both parties have confidence, have attempted, with great success, to prevent and to terminate strikes. Sometimes these boards are permanent bodies. The North of England Board of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Manufactured Iron Trade, which was founded in 1869, has been the most successful, and the London Chamber of Commerce has shown itself very useful and active in the same direction. It is said that some 3,000 disputes in the Northumberland coal trade have been settled by joint committees. </para>
            <para>The example has been chiefly set in France, where, as early as the reign of the Great Napoleon, conciliation boards were established, under the name of Conseils de Prud&#39;hommes, for the purpose of settling disputes about the terms of labour compacts. Each of them is divided into a bureau of conciliation and a bureau of judgment, or, as we should say, of arbitration. They are instituted at the initiative of the local chamber of commerce by Government decree, and they consist of equal numbers of employers and workmen, with a  president  and vice-president, who were once appointed by the Government but are now elected by the body itself. The success of these bodies has been very remarkable. From 30.000 to 45,000 cases are said to be annually brought before them, and in about 70 per cent. of these cases they succeed in reconciling the disputants. In Belgium, Austria, and Germany, also, there are elaborate provisions for settling labour disputes. In England an Act was passed in 1867 authorizing the Secretary of State, under certain conditions, to grant a licence for the formation of councils much like those in France, and, while strictly limiting the subjects on which they might pronounce, it gave them powers of enforcing awards ; but this Act, as well as a later one which was carried in 1872, appears to have been a dead- letter, and conciliation and arbitration boards of a purely voluntary character have been found most acceptable both to employers and workmen. They have greatly multiplied, and boards of this kind, consisting of equal numbers of employers and workmen, have been established in a great variety of trades. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That shows that the honorable member was hardly justified in saying that there had been no successful conciliation in England. Of course, in America it has not met with the same success ; but the Americans, it must be remembered, have adopted other means to avert industrial strife. Because in England and America the system has not been successful, some honorable members appear to think that we should legislate in the direction now proposed. </para>

We have evidence of this in another important advance, the sliding scale, which provides not a fixed wage, but in some degree a settlement by results. Increased demands bring higher prices and profits to the employer, which in turn bring workmen higher returns, so that as the employer&#39;s profits rise and fall, so do the workman&#39;s rewards. </para>
          <para class="block">If I were asked what was the best service the Carnegie Company was ever able to render the wage-earner, next to giving steady employment at wages equal to any. I should answer, by persuading them to adopt the sliding scale with a minimum insuring living wages, at its works, at Braddock, fourteen years ago, which has given perfect satisfaction from that day to this, and is still in force, and has produced undisturbed harmony between capital and labour. The sliding scale is u great advance over the lixed wage, not only by securing the workman a prompter and more certain share of the profits, but also because&#39; it raises his status. </para>

          <para class="block">I view with considerable apprehension the operation of a Bill of this character. When we speak of conciliation having failed in America and England, it almost seems that big operations outgrow that method of settling industrial disputes, and .that something broader and of more general application is necessary. The honorable and learned member for Parkes the other night made a remark which was perfectly true, but which was not well received by the House. He declared that there was no difference between the principle underlying the action of a man selling his labour and that of a shopman selling a hat. That is absolutely true, and it accords with what Carlyle calls the cash nexus ; in other words, making cash payment the sole connecting principle. But the personal element is not brought in, as it always is in the case of people who are closely associated. It introduces a different factor altogether. The difficulty, of course, is to introduce the personal element into these large concerns. But, if we cannot have the old feeling of mutual regard, we can at least secure mutual interest by resorting to methods of this kind, which are growing in the United States of America. What I fear in connexion with a proposal of this kind is not so much the actual effect of the decisions which may be given by the Court, but the general effect which the passing of legislation of this kind will have. We are constantly going farther and farther in this direction. It is said that the voluntary&#39; system of conciliation is not quite successful. I hope that it has, and indeed I think that it has, been very successful, but because it is contended that it has not been wholly successful, it is suggested that we must, perforce, put on another turn of the legislative screw. As our working classes increase - and although we are losing some of them at present, I trust that the drift will soon be stopped - our industrial undertakings must keep pace, or there will be no work for the increasing number of workmen to perform. We are all familiar with the old story : Two employers seeking one workman - high wages ; two workmen seeking one employer - low wages. I am afraid that this class of legislation is tending to discourage the expansion and multiplication of industrial undertakings, and it is only by the extension of these undertakings that there is likely to be any prospect of an increase of wages. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carnegie</inline> asserts that ninety-five out of every 100 men engaged in small business enterprises fail. That is an extraordinary and startling statement to make. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carnegie</inline> admits that it is ; but, if it be true, it serves to show that it is not all skittles and beer for the employer. I am also inclined to believe that, as the result of the operation of this measure, a good many people will think life too short to warprant them in enduring all the worries which business must in these circumstances entail upon them. Many of them will withdraw from business, and be content with smaller profits derived from other sources. I rercently heard of some men who had been engaged in dairy farming in Gippsland, but who, having carried out all the work of the farm without outside assistance, have done so well that they can now afford to take life easily. They have accordingly given up dairy farming, and are now putting cattle on their land for fattening purposes. They may not make large profits in this way, but they will be able to lead a more comfortable life than before. If they could secure men who would render faithful service to them they would probably continue dairy farming, which they have found so profitable, and, being now able to afford it, give employment to a certain number of hands. My experience, of agricultural and pastoral work teaches me that it is the casual hand who invariably causes difficulty and trouble. The men who are engaged working on the farm all the year round never originate any disputes. With the introduction of new machinery, the casual hand will practically be done away with. The reaper and binder, the complete harvester, and other improvements in agricultural machinery, make it possible now to carry on farming operations with the few hands who may be employed on a farm all the year round, and, therefore, I do not apprehend that this measure -will give rise to much trouble so far as casual hands are concerned. I am satisfied, however, that if they could be secured for ordinary rates of pay - and in my district they receive <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> 10s. per week during the harvesting season - our operations would be materially extended. The shearing difficul tj&#39; is also being overcome, and I do not apprehend much trouble from the working of the Act in that direction. In all probability, in a very short time, the pastoralists will rid themselves of the disputes which so frequently occur between the employers and the shearers, by entering into contracts for the shearing of their sheep, although I do not suggest that that course will be a good thing for the men or for the people residing in the pastoral districts ; it is one of the outcomes of labour troubles. I have here a statement taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which I know to be correct. In a report from Mount Gambier it sets forth that - </para>

            <para>The managers and owners of the Mount Schanck and Moorak stations, the two largest in the south-east, have let their shearing to machine shearers in Melbourne, and much concern is felt by local hand shearers, as the two stations engage about 150 men in all for over a month at shearing time in November. The action in securing machine shearers was due to expected trouble with the men regarding rates of pay. </para>

              <para>- I have always favoured voluntary conciliation and arbitration, but I am afraid that the compulsory system will lead to strife, which may ultimately be beyond the reach of any law that we might make. I have no desire to take up the time of the House further than to say that I feel I am quite justified in the attitude which I take up in regard to this matter by reason of the action of leading members in the more serene atmosphere of the Convention. It appears to me that we are hurrying on very rapidly with legislation of this kind. We heard much of mandates from the country in relation to various questions, but so far as I am aware we have received no mandate in regard to this matter. The honorable member for Wannon, who is engaged in public business elsewhere and is unable to be in the chamber to-day, drew my attention before he left the House to certain passages in the report of the Convention which took place in Melbourne, and which I shall quote in justification of the attitude which I propose to adopt. I contend that we should not hurry into legislation of this kind. This is a question rather for State legislation than for Commonwealth enactment. I have heard the Attorney-General more than once use the. illustration of the coat and the shirt in reference to the State and the Commonwealth forms of government, and, possibly, if a man&#39;s shirt were made of hair, he would prefer to wear it on the outside, even at some inconvenience to his neighbour. It would be well, in my opinion, however, if the States were left to their troubles at home, until we have gained more experience in this direction. In looking over the Contention debates on the question of conciliation and arbitration, I find that the power given to the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in this direction is placed very low down in the section defining our powers. It does not seem, to me that any member of the Convention anticipated at the time that there would be any haste in bringing this principle into force. </para>

            <para>- This question is one of the greatest importance of all that have come before the House. To my mind, the beneficial results which will flow from the proposed legislation cannot be overestimated. Honorable members, in discussing the Bill, have wisely, I think, confined their remarks to its general principles, and have, so far as possible, refrained from dealing with its provisions in detail. If they had done otherwise, the debate would have been robbed to a great extent of its educational value, which in my opinion is very great. Having listened attentively to the speeches of honorable members, I have been struck with the weakness of the opposition to the measure. It seems to be based entirely upon misapprehension and fancy. Those who have spoken against the Bill appear to be afraid to be guided by the teachings of recent history, or to give up a weapon which they have found of use in the past. The conservative method of dealing with a great industrial problem such as this is al ways out of place. Honorable members need a wider vision. They should take that ampler view which we hoped when we entered upon our national life would always be taken of matters coming before this Parliament. From what I have read, the legislation which has been called experimental has  amply demonstrated the soundness of the principles upon which it was framed. I should not have been surprised if the opposition to this measure had come from those who are being asked to lay down the only weapon which they have possessed in the past, and which they have often wielded with great effect. But in this matter, as in many others, the labour organizations of Australia have shown themselves to be in advance of the labour organizations of the old world. They have been able to get rid of the old traditions and conservative trammels. The representatives of the workers in this Commonwealth are entitled to all the credit that can be given to them for the courage which they have shown, not only in the expression of their opinions, but by their trustfulness in placing their destinies in the hands of this Parliament. We have been told that the labour unions of Great Britain object to compulsory arbitration, and I believe that that is a fact. But they are not on anything like the same plane as those of Australia. I do not wish to decry the workers of the old country, but, speaking from a personal knowledge of them, I say that the Australian workers occupy a higher plane as regards education, and especially as regards political education. The history of labour struggles has been alluded to more than once in this debate, and therefore, it is not my intention to go very deeply into the matter. I ask honorable members, however, to recollect the inevitable results of great industrial struggles. Such struggles have always resulted in personal loss and suffering, and nearly always in injury to the State. The loss and suffering is not confined to those immediately concerned in the dispute. It has always gone beyond them, and has perhaps been greatest among those who were not in any way responsible for either the beginning or the continuance of the struggle. I have a lively recollection of the great Scottish railway strike, which occurred when I was a student in the old country. I had then an opportunity to learn .something of the condition of the helpless ones during a great struggle between two large contending parties. The men who were out on strike paraded the streets of Edinburgh, and their condition - which is never anything like so good as that of the railway employes of Australia - appealed so strongly to the charitablyminded of that city that arrangements were made for supplying them with at least one meal a day. But there were hundreds of helpless women and children who, on the average, did not get one meal each day during the strike. The things which I saw and the facts I heard then drew my attention to the &#34; evil of these pro:ceedings, and the recollection of them has never faded from my memory. In the pursuit of my studies I had to visit parts of the city where these people resided, and, as I do not wish to dwell upon what must always remain in my mind as a very painful memory will only say that the scenes which I then witnessed were sufficient to create the resolution within me that I would take any and every means to prevent such an occurrence wherever I might be placed, and especially in the country which I am proud to call my native land. I saw there the inevitable results which are not always apparent to the public, and which are, I regret to say, in some cases almost completely unknown to those who are, at any rate, in some degree responsible for them. I allude to the employers and the capitalists, whose surroundings are totally different from those whose condition I have attempted to describe. As has been pointed out, the women and children are not aggressive. If they take any action in regard to strikes, it is of a protective character, and intended rather to resist enroachment than to secure concessions. To these silent and undoubtedly suffering ones, the House owes a very evident duty. The Joss to the State occasioned by strikes must be enormous. I admit that it is not always ascertainable. We cannot gather information by the means at our disposal which would enable us to accurately gauge the consequences of these great industrial struggles. They are not always immediately felt, but as surely as the sun rises so surely must the State as a whole feel them. In these days, when the very existence of a State depends not upon the soldiers upon its borders, nor upon the ships sailing its seas, but upon its power of production, any interference with the course of trade and commerce is a matter of the most vital consequence. We have been told frequently during this debate that if the Bill becomes law capital will become affrighted - capital which is always on these occasions described as a very shy bird - and that we shall be driving away that element which  is so necessary to complete an effective production. I would, however, ask those who advance that argument whether stability and fixity of labour conditions will not rather offer an incentive to the investment of capital in our midst; <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have been told that every action on the part of the worker to improve his condition, however minute it may be, will increase the alarm of capital. But if we erect a Court which will do away with the possibility of the stoppage of production, we shall invite capitalists to invest their money amongst us rather than scare them from our midst. Under the provisions of the Bill there could be no stoppage of the wheels of industry. They would revolve as regularly, production would continue as if no dispute had occurred, and except for the few men who might be required to attend the Court as witnesses, there would be no cessation oi work. There would be no loss to the State, no loss to the employer, because his output would not be interfered with, and no loss to the workers, whose wages would beregularly paid. Under these circumstances we must admit that just as it is good for the worker to have a Court of this description, so should it prove advantageous to the capitalist to have an opportunity&#39; to settle all disputes without the machinery and buildings, in which most of his capital is sunk lying idle.

          <para class="block">There is a question which we may endeavour to address to ourselves. In my opinion we have here placed at our disposal the very means for carrying out in its entirety  the desire expressed in that sentence. I remember that some years ago a proposal was made to fix a minimum wage for the men employed in the Government workshops of Victoria. A very determined effort was made to stem what was afterwards proved to be an irresistible tide. I. had just previously entered the State Parliament, and I was carried away by the eloquence of those who were pleading on behalf of the familiar, never-to-be-forgotten, and I am afraid never-to-be-lost, old and slow worker. He was paraded before us then, and I suppose he will be trotted out again. I must admit that the eloquent words uttered by those who were pleading his cause - I have since found out that they were rather pleading their own cause - so impressed me, that I refrained from supporting the proposition. Very little inquiry, however, was sufficient to show me, when the resolution was passed a few months later, that there was nothing in the fear that was then expressed - a fear which I feel sure will rank with those now being entertained with regard to the present movement. It was years before the Parliament of Victoria could be prevailed upon to pass a resolution insuring to the State employes a minimum living wage. Almost directly after this Parliament assembled a motion of a similar character was proposed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and I had the pleasure of seconding it. It was carried without any opposition, and it has remained in force to this day. We have not heard that any of the old or slow workers in the Commonwealth service have suffered in consequence. </para>

            <para>Perhaps one of the most curious facts in the history of human error is the denial by the common political economist of the possibility of thus regulating wages ; while, for all the important, and much of the unimportant, labour on the earth, wages are already so regulated. We do not sell our Prime Ministership by Dutch auction, nor, on the decease of a bishop, whatever may be the general advantages of simony, do we (yet i otter his diocese to the clergyman who will take the episcopacy at the lowest contract. We (with exquisite sagacity of political <inline font-style="italic">economy</inline> !) do indeed sell commissions ; but not openly, generalships ; sick, we do not inquire for a physician, who takes less than a guinea ;. litigious, we never think of reducing six-and-eightpence to four-and-sixpence ; caught in a shower, we do not canvass, the cabman, to find one who values his driving at less than sixpence per mile .... but, so , far as the practical and immediate administration of the matter is regarded, the best labour always has been, and is, as <inline font-style="italic">all</inline> labour ought to be, paid by an invariable standard.  &#39; What ! &#34; the reader perhaps answers amazedly , &#34; PV good and bad workmen alike ? &#34; Certainly. The difference between one prelate&#39;s sermons and his successor&#39;s - or between one physician&#39;s opinion and another&#39;s t- is far greater, as respects the qualities of mind involved, and fatmore important in result to you personally, than the difference between good and bad laying of bricks, though that is greater than most people suppose. Yet you pay with equal fee, contentedly, the good and bad workman upon your soul, and the good and bad workmen upon your body ; much more may you pay, contentedly, with equal fees, the good and bad workmen upon your house. &#34;Nay, but I choose my physician, and (?) my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work.&#34; By all means, also, choose your bricklayer ; that is the proper reward of the good workman to be &#34;chosen.&#34; &#176; </para>
            <para class="block">I think that places the whole matter in a nutshell. There is no desire on the part of the framers of the Bill or of this Parliament to compel the employer to employ the good and the bad workman alike. The employer is to have his choice. The question I asked was whether it was possible for us to apply any remedy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pember</inline> Beeves, in his introduction to Henry Demarest Lloyd&#39;s work <inline font-style="italic">A Country without Striken,</inline> says - </para>

            <para class="block">I sincerely trust that that definition of Australia will be amply verified by the action taken with regard to this measure. The right honorable and learned member for South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kingston,</inline> said that Australia was content to make her own precedents. I think  that that is a very proper attitude to adopt when we are following the line which has already been laid down by some of these States and by New Zealand, which are leading the rest of the world with regard to industrial legislation. The right honorable and learned member truly said that Australia &#34;does not fear to embark on a course of legislation for which there is no precedent.&#34; With regard to what has been done in the past I may point out that we have in Victoria the Factories and Shops Act, which was designed - and it has amply fulfilled its object - to relieve the workers from the consequences of sweating. lt was not designed to deal with disputes, but simply to fix working hours and rates of pay in certain cases. The Wages Boards had no power to deal with any dispute that might occur between employer and employe. The object of this Bill is not only to stamp out sweating - because undoubtedly that will be one of its first results - but also to improve the condition of the worker. It is intended to give him an opportunity to appeal to a judicial tribunal - a tribunal composed, not of members of one class of the community, but of a representative of his own class and a representative of the employers, together with a Justice of the High Court. It is designed to prevent industrial conflicts. Under the Factories Act of Victoria, we had no opportunity to deal with any impending disputes, and the benefits conferred by that statute have therefore been of a very limited character. The opportunities for arbitration have not been very many in this State, but nevertheless the benefits which flow from arbitration have been felt very strongly in connexion with one industry - I allude to the mining industry. In that industry there were a large number of men who were engaged in very laborious work under conditions which were not&#39; at all conducive either to their health or their well-being. From time to time disputes arose between them and their employers. In the district of Creswick thousands of miners were employed under conditions such as I have already described. Those conditions were improved year by year without the great majority of the men being cognizant of the fact. The honorable member for Darling was the intermediary. He went between the men who were suffering and the employers who had no desire to inflict suffering upon them, but who were ignorant of the conditions under which they laboured. The result was not only an improvement in the condition of the miners of the district I have named, but the &#34; common rule &#34; was observed, and a better state of things now obtains throughout the whole of Victoria. The improvement is very largely due to the conciliatory methods of this the first Arbitration &#34; Bill &#34; of Victoria. Of course we have only to look to New Zealand to witness the results of legislation such as that which is now proposed. There a similar Act has been in operation for some years, and I have carefully studied the writings of those who have reported both in favour of it and against it. The weight of evidence is very strongly in its favour. I admit that the Conciliation Boards have not given the same satisfaction as have the Courts of Arbitration. At first not very much advantage was taken of the Arbitration Courts in New Zealand, but as they became better understood they were more availed of. The result has been that not only do the employes desire to see the principles of the Act maintained, but the employers are now registering and coming under its operation as rapidly as possible. They freely recognise the benefit to be derived from so doing. We have recently had the advantage of a very valuable report by a Royal Commission in Victoria, which was appointed to investigate the law relating to factories and shops. That document, compiled with magnificent industry and impartial accuracy, contains facts in regard to the working of the Act in New Zealand, obtained on the spot, which are of the utmost value to us in considering this question. But, before dealing with those facts, I desire to point out that the Commission consisted of the Honorable A. R. Outtrini, M.L.A.,  Chairman  ; the Honorable George Godfrey, M.L.C., the Honorable Jos. Sternberg, M.L.C., the Honorable J. F. Levien, Messrs. G. H. Bennett, F. H. Bromley, H. S. W. Lawson, E. Wilkins, and J. W. Mason, members of the Legislative Assembly. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commission was composed of members of both branches of the Legislature, as well as of representatives of the town and the country.

But, under the compulsory arbitration law, the &#34; Old Song of the Shirt &#34; is a &#34; Lost Chord &#34; in New Zealand. In this case the women&#39;s organization called the manufacturers into court.

While this debate was proceeding in the roomy Arbitration Court, the sewing women sat secure in their factories, lighted and ventilated, and safeguarded by the sanitary and other care of the State, and their work went on. The sewing woman did not have to strike ; she could not be looked out ; her work could not be taken from her ; her wages could not be cut down except with the approval of the court. This is the new &#34; Song of the Shirt.&#34; </para>

            <para>Despite certain defects in detail which have been revealed by experience, the New Zealand Conciliation and Arbitration Act remains to-day the fairest, the  most complete, and the most useful labour law on the statute-books of the Australasian States. And it is, on the whole, a wise social law. on the one hand protecting the fair-minded employer from the dishonest competition of the sweater, who keeps down the cost of production <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> paying miserably low wages, and on the otherthe toiling thousands, to whom a rise in wages of a fewshillings a week when an industry can fairly bear it often means the difference between gripidg poverty and comparative comfort. But beyond that, it has the great merit of providing effective meaus for preserving unimpaired the industrial relationship of employer and worker, in forbidding the miserable warfare which displays itself in strikes and lock-outs, and the stern reprisals which too often accompany them, while ample opportunity is given for conciliatory methods of settling disputes before compulsion is invoked. The law may fairly be said to have passed successfully through its period of probation. Its main principles have stood the test of time, and while em plovers- and workers alike keenly criticise each other&#39;s actions in connexion with its operation in certain industrial centres, in no part of the colony which we visited did we hear <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> general desire expressed for its repeal. Many suggestions were, indeed, made for minor alterations, but they were put forward with the view of improving the general administration of the Act, while preserving its main principles in their integrity. </para>

          <para>He apparently desired us to believe that if this measure became law we should have attempts on the part of the workers - he did not say the employers would rush the Court - to take up the time of the Court by submitting cases which might have been settled without any trouble. I would remind the honorable and learned member, and those who think with him, that no strike of any magnitude has been caused by a single act. Men have been caused to go out <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> strike by the commission of a number of acts by an employer, and it has probably been the commission of a number of acts on the part of employes that has led the employers to lock them out. The aggregation of a number of these acts might have been avoided altogether if we had had an opportunity to deal with them as they can be dealt with in a measure such as this. We should prevent the particles from accumulating. The momentum which a large moving mass acquires depends very largely upon its weight, and if we can prevent the weight from accruing we shall probably avoid the resulting avalanche and all the suffering and loss which are the inevitable consequences of a great industrial struggle. The number of cases which come before the Court prove, to my mind, the efficiency of the law, but some honorable members appear to think that it would be well if none were forthcoming. The only way in which to secure that end would be to resort to a complete system of cooperation as between employer and employe. When that system is adopted - and the honorable member for Grampians desires to see it - when we have the employer and the employe mutually benefiting from the operations of both, we shall require no Arbitration Courts. But as long as Capital and Labour are divided, as they are under our present conditions - as long as Capital determines to get all it can out of Labour, regardless of the consequences to Labour - we shall require such Courts for the protection of Labour. </para>

              <para>- As to the innumerable disputes which it is said will arise, it seems to me that prevention is better than cure. If we deal with them in time we shall prevent the occurrence of any strike. We have no desire to institute a Court of Arbitration in order that it may be continually employed in dealing with great matters. We prefer that it shall deal with the smaller questions, for we realize that in that event great disputes will never occur. It is like removing dust from the mainspring of a watch. When we do that we relieve the cause of friction, and all the parts are able to work harmoniously together. Honorable members of the Opposition say that thefact that a number of small disputes have engaged the attention of someof the Arbitration Courts proves that legislation of this kind is a failure, and that we do not require an Arbitration Court to deal with such questions. But I should be surprised if the honorable and learned member for Parkes were to assert that, because a great number of people in Tasmania are applying to be vaccinated, owing to the outbreak of small-pox in that State, the. Health Act should be abolished, inasmuch as the fact that so many people are seeking to be vaccinated proves it to be of no service. Organization is necessary on both sides for the proper working of this measure. The fruits which we hope to derive from it will never be obtained without that organization.

          <para>I believe in organized labour, and I have for thirty years. I believe in it, because .... it is much easier for those who represent the employers to come into close contact with the labourer, and by dealing with fewer persons to accomplish results quicker and better. </para>
          <para class="block">There is not the slightest doubt that organization tends to prevent disputes. When a dispute does arise it is possible to arrive at a more speedy settlement if one has an organization to deal with, instead of large bodies of men who are under no control. There is one matter which I feel bound to mention. During my study of this subject I have come across a statement showing that, during the operation of the Act in New Zealand the number of unionists has decreased instead of increased, whilst the number of unions has increased. The cause of this is a matter for speculation. In March, 1900, there were 26,067 unionists out of 48,938 operatives. In December, 1901 - I was unable to obtain a comparison for the corresponding period of the year - there were 23,769 unionistsout of 57,098 operatives. During this period of twentyone months the number of operatives increased by over 8,000, while the number of unionists decreased to the extent of nearly 3,000. Many new unions were also formed. Their creation, I am told, was due largely to the representations of the employers. This shows that the employers are discovering the beneficial results which follow from union amongst their workmen. They are able to deal with the executives of the unions, and thus to secure a more rapid and satisfactory settlement of their difficulties. It is clear from these facts that the members of the unions, in view of the character of the Arbitration Act in force in that colony, rely more trustfully upon the Court than they would upon any ordinary means adopted for the settlement of disputes. It is said that it would be unfair for us to pass legislation which would affect the whole of the States. I do not propose to deal with the question of the &#34;prevention&#34; of disputes, nor with the terms of the section of the Constitution which enables us to deal with this subject. That is a question to be considered perhaps in Committee, and the legal members of the House will probably be able to deal more satisfactorily with it. It seems to me, however, that we must have one uniform law operating throughout the Commonwealth. One reason why we should take action at the present time is that there is a desire on the part of a very large number of people residing in States in which there is no local Conciliation and Arbitration Act that such a measure should be placed on their statute-book. It is well that they should not have States Acts dealing with these matters. It is far more desirable that the Federal authority, which knows no party, so far as States are concerned, should deal solely with this important subject. The application of the common rule has also to be considered. It would be manifestly unfair if an award were made, for example, in the boot trade in Victoria which would not apply in New South Wales. We have only to look at recent events in order to discover how such a system would operate. Tn this State we had a Factories Act which settled the rates of wages, the hours of employment, the number of improvers and apprentices to be employed in factories, and other matters in connexion with the boot trade. In New South Wales they had no such provision, but when the Arbitration Act was passed in that State, an application was made to bring the trade under the law. The consequence was that wages in two branches of the trade were brought up to the&#34; level of the Victorian rates. We have often been told that New South Wales manufacturers under free-trade were paying very much better wages than were being paid in Victoria under protection, and that, in the boot trade, Victorian employes were being sweated to an extraordinary degree. The fact which I have just mentioned shows that in two branches of the trade the advantage was on the side of the Victorian operatives. The result of uniformity has been that the boot importation from Victoria into New South Wales, although in 1901 valued at only &#163;33,925, rose during the first nine months of 1902 to &#163;64,666, so that it as nearly as possible doubled in that period. Of course, the abolition of the border duties, and the operation of the uniform Tariff, was responsible for some part of that increase, but those facts do not account for the whole of it. This is proved by the fact that the number of operatives in the boot factories of New South Wales has been reduced because the work is being done in Victoria. It is being done here because legislation has assisted our industries until they have arrived at such a condition that they are able to more than withstand the competition of similar industries in the neighbouring States. I have been told that in one Ne,w South Wales factory alone the number of hands has been reduced, since the alteration of wages, from 450 to 80. </para>

              <para>- The Attorney-General then referred to the possibility of a State Parliament having its Appropriation Act made subject to an award of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and he asked if such an interference would be tolerated. He also drew a very telling picture of a bailiff of the Court being placed in charge of the Chief Secretary&#39;s Department in Melbourne. I was very glad to hear him say, however, that the clause was inserted, not because it was needed, but to invite from honorable members an expression of opinion on the subject. I am very pleased to be able to give my opinion upon it. So far as the employes of the Commonwealth are concerned, I think it is necessary that they should be placed within the scope of the Bill, because the Commonwealth should begin by setting its own house in order. It should not ask private individuals to do what it is not prepared to do itself. In New Zealand, although State employes were not at first included within the scope of the Act, they were subsequently brought under its provisions. </para>

              <para>- In New Zealand they were brought under the Act at the request of the employers, who passed a resolution, inviting the Government to include the railway servants. The Governments of the States of Australia are different from Governments in any other part of the world. They do a greatdeal that in other places is left to private enterprise, and enter into competition with private employers to an extent which is not known elsewhere. In Victoria, for instance, not only does the State maintain and work the railways, but it also constructs them, the contractor having been done away with for some years past. But under the Bill as it stands, the navvies employed by the Construction Branch of the Railway Department are outside the scope of the Bill. Some of us hope to see State enterprise extended. We hope, for instance, that the Government will see the advisability of establishing an arms and ammunition factory under the provisions of the Defence Bill. Surely men employed in such a dangerous occupation as the making of ammunition should . not be exempted from the provisions of the Bill merely because they are employed by the Government? The honorable member for Maranoa, too, advocated the establishment of aclothing factory, where, I suppose, the wool from the sheep&#39;s backs will beconverted into cloth, and made up into uniforms for the members of our Defence Forces, the postal officials, and other public servants. Why should not the States, when competing with private enterprise, be compelled to conform to the conditions which are imposed upon private individuals ? . I think that we are bound to place ourselves under exactly the same conditions as we impose upon private employers. We are told that Parliament is a sufficient Court for Government employes. But Parliament is under the duress of party Government. Here parties are continually striving bo maintain or gain positions, and to keep or win place and power. Surely such a state of things as that means that attention cannot be paid to the details with which a Court would be concerned. It is notorious that a great deal of the unrest and dissatisfaction in Great Britain is caused by the fact that affairs of Empire prevent the House of Commons from undertaking the social and domestic legislation which is so necessary at the present day. We shall probably find ourselves in the same condition. It will be impossible for us to give attention to the righting of abuses which may arise in connexion with the employment of persons under the authority of &#39; the Government. Therefore I think that the argument of the Attorney-General as to the competency of Parliament to deal with these matters is of no value. Experience shows that the clerical class does not care to come under the operation of these Acts. They refused to.do so in New Zealand and also in Victoria. I believe that originally the Government intended to bring them under the law, but they petitioned against it, and were exempted. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily. I am referring only to the enterprises which are now carried out by the States or by the Commonwealth. I am not saying anything in regard to the future undertakings of these Governments. Some of the. Commonwealth public servants have a right to congratulate themselves that they are no longer under the control of the States authorities ; and I think that the absence of any desire on their part to come under the provisions of the Bill is due to contentment with their present conditions. I recognise that the States Governments could refuse to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the proposed Court. There are, however, very few cases in which they refuse to appoint nominal defendants who can be sued in the civil courts. If there is no loss of dignity in appearing before the civil courts, surely there would be no loss of dignity in appearing before an Arbitration Court. </para>

          <para class="block">As he holds that opinion, he should be the first to declare that a State Government would suffer no degradation in appearing before the Court. At least those who are employed under, and whose hours of labour, rates of wages and conditions of employment are determined by, intermediate authorities constituted under the law of a State of the Commonwealth should come within the scope of the Bill. I consider that the constitution of the tribunal is a vital matter. There should be no partisans upon it. On some of the Conciliation Boards of New Zealand the sorry spectacle has been presented of men announcing themselves as partisans. They altogether failed to realize the positions they occupied. They were not there as advocates, but as judges, and they should have absolutely divested themselves of all party bias or feeling, and have given a verdict in accordance with the evidence submitted. I am glad to say that the Arbitration Court in New Zealand is held in the highest esteem. The only serious statement made regarding it took the form of a charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Cooper, which was, at the request of the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon,</inline> fully and completely withdrawn. The Court possesses the fullest and most complete confidence of both parties in New Zealand. I think that a time limit should be fixed between the hearing of a case and the award. One of the objections urged in New Zealand is that cases are allowed to drag on for a considerable time, and that even after the hearing considerable delay occurs before the award is given. Happily there is no cessation of work, but it is desirable that all feeling of unrest should be avoided, and that the award should be given as soon as possible. I think that the evidence is all against &#34;the proposal that lawyers should be permitted to appear before the Arbitration Court. In New South Wales the practice is said to lead to enormous delay, and to involve great expense. The proceedings of the Court should be conducted at a .minimum of expense. It should be open to the poorest in the land, and no barrier to a hearing should be erected. We should endeavour to place the Court at the disposal of every one, and we cannot hope to achieve success if we do anything that would lead to unnecessary expense. Finally, I desire to say that, in my opinion, the Bill represents a part of the true protective policy which has been laid down by this Parliament. I believe that it is the natural corollary of our legislation with regard to customs and excise duties. We have enacted that the manufacturer shall be protected against the cruel and cutting competition of foreign rivals, who are working under more favorable conditions to them, and it is now desired to go a step further and extend to those who are employed by the manufacturer some of the benefits which we have given to their employer. We are seeking to protect the workman against the competition of the sweated labour of other parts of the world. In this twentieth century we have almost annihilated space. The distance between the old world and Australia is now a mere matter of hours, and we can readily understand that the labour conditions in the older countries will have a most potent effect upon our production. We have legislated in the direction of excluding undesirable persons, and securing a white Australia, but we cannot hope to maintain a perfect white man&#39;s country unless we protect our people from the competition of those who are working under sweating conditions. We must start by making our own doorstep clean, and we must not allow sweating to continue in the land. We know that we have already a number of undesirables iri certain parts of the Commonwealth, and a great deal of effort will be required on the part of those chiefly interested to make this element loosen the fangs which it has so deeply embedded in our heritage. By passing the measure now before iis, we shall open a new era of prosperity, not only for the employer, but for the employed. I trust that we shall be able in the near future to turn our attention to the third branch of the true protective policy, by insuring that the consumer shall obtain from the manufacturer, and the worker who are protected by us, a pure and unadulterated article at the lowest possible cost. The consumer will derive far more pleasure from the use of our products, when he is able to realize that that which he enjoys has not been secured at the expense of the bone and sinew of the country, and that to the extent to which he uses such products he is helping on that era of prosperity and industrial peace which we believe is now being opened to Australia. </para>

            <para>I recognise that a question of such transcendent importance and far-reaching interest as this demands consideration at the hands of every honorable member, and that, even though the attendance of honorable members may be small at times, that fact does not indicate that they are not only profoundly interested in the Bill, but determined to see it through, and at the same time to do full and ample justice to every important proposal it contains. On the one hand, I see no reason for delaying the continuation of the debate, as suggested in the petition presented to-day by the honorable member for Wentworth, whilst, on the other hand, there is certainly no desire to rush it forward with unseemly haste. The petitioners may rest assured that the Bill will receive -the most earnest and careful consideration - clause by clause, line by line, and word by word - and I sincerely hope that there will be no ground whatever for the complaint that every one has not had an opportunity of being heard, or that abundant time has not been given to thoroughly understand the principles and leading provisions of the Bill. Although every honorable member may not regard it as necessary to address the House on this question, I am not disposed to give a silent vote, &#39;because I think my constituents have a right to be acquainted with my views, and because silence may in some cases be misconstrued I am proud to have an opportunity to. express my opinions, although I am afraid that I shall not be able to add much to the enlightened expositions of the principles of the Bill with which the House has been favoured by previous speakers. I have listened to some of the speeches which -have been delivered, with something like despairing admiration, and I am sure that they will hereafter be regarded as monuments of the oratorical ability of honorable members, and as evidence of great industry and profound study on their part. The honorable member for Wentworth summarized the arguments against the Bill as comprehensively and fairly as possible, and I think the House&#39; was rather glad to hear the case stated from the side represented by the honorable member. The . House is anxious that views such as those referred to by the petitioners shall be fairly placed before us, so that we may have another opportunity to consider them. The views presented by the honorable member for Wentworth, as well as those put forward by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, will receive - as indeed most of them have already received - careful consideration. 1 was struck by one assertion made by the honorable member for Wentworth. He drew a picture of some capitalist who might have &#163;100,000 or &#163;200,000 to invest in Australia. He represented that capitalist as asking himself why he should come to Australia to invest his money in industrial enterprises and expose himself to the liability to be called before some industrial tribunal, in order that the amount of wages to be paid by him, and the hours of labour of his employes, might be fixed. The honorable member thoughtthat the position was so unreasonable that the capitalist would pause before he launched himself upon such a rash enterprise. I would point out, in reply, that this Bill is intended rather to give strength, stability and continuity to the enterprises of capital. On the very face of it, it imposes a new command upon labour by saying to it, &#34; Hereafter labourers shall not be allowed to strike.&#34; On the other hand, .it says to the capitalist, &#34; You shall not sweat your employes or bring about a lock-out.&#34; I submit that when a prohibition of that kind is &#39;placed upon the statute-book of the country its tendency is rather to augment financial stability than to shake confidence in the investment of capital. It i3 not a one-sided arrangement &#39; which permits an employer to be dragged into Court without any corresponding obligation being imposed on the workmen. It is#a scheme of a co-relative character in which obligations are imposed upon both sides, so that on the one hand the worker is secured against unfair treatment, and on the other the employer is secured against the workmen unjustly deserting his service. I should like to point out that even in countries where there is no such legislation very powerful agencies are sometimes at work which compel capitalists as .well as workmen to submit their disputes to arbitration. Need I&#39; remind honorable members of the extraordinary spectacle which was recently witnessed in the United. States in connexion with the great anthracite coal strike. In that case about 150,000 men were on strike for upwards of four or five months, during which time capital to the extent of many millions of dollars was wasted, many lives were sacrificed, many homes ruined, and the prospects of many a man were blasted for ever. What occurred in that great, free Republic where there is no compulsory Arbitration Act operative? Things reached an extraordinary pass -a state almost amounting to civil war - the public safety was endangered to such an extent that the  president  of his own initiative intervened. He sent for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pierpont</inline> Morgan, the millionaire, and informed him that he would hold him responsible for the strike, and that unless it was terminated by reference to arbitration, the armies of the United States would take possession of the field of struggle. What was the consequence? As the result of his intervention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morgan</inline> communicated with the coal-owners as well as with the workmen and compelled them to submit their case to arbitration - a course which they had refused to adopt for months previously. In that case arbitration was forced upon the employers as well as upon the workmen, even in the absence of an arbitration law. Ear better is it for us to so legislate that the tribunal which it is proposed to establish can intervene in a legal manner for the prevention of occurrences of such a serious character. But for the intervention of the  President  in the manner I have described, it is impossible to predict what might have happened, because practically a state of civil war prevailed. Both parties were at arm&#39;s length, and neither evinced the slightest disposition to terminate hostilities, But the strong arm of the Executive intervened, and the parties to the. dispute yielded to the intervention of that authority, as typifying law and order, when they declined to yield to the pressure of unorganized public opinion. So much for the 4.200,000 which, according to the honorable member for Wentworth, a London capitalist, would be afraid to invest in Australia lest he should be called upon . to appear before a legally-constituted Arbitration Court, empowered to deal with any question as between an employer and emPloy&#233;. The honorable member has practically repeated. the contention which was the basis of the speech of the honorable and learned member for Parkes. The chief objection of the latter to this Bill is that it will take the management of business out of the hands of the men who own and conduct it. The honorable and learned member for Parkes declared that during the whole of English history the tendency has been in the direction of individual liberty as against restraints imposed by the State. </para>

              <para>- Certainly he has not studied the lessons of English history, to say nothing of the history of other countries. I need scarcely remind the honorable and learned member for Parkes that the Parliament of England has at various stages of its history asserted its right to intervene in questions of capital as against labour. Need I refer to the celebrated Act known as the Statute of Labourers, which was passed in the reign of Edward III. That is the first Wages Act, perhaps, which is recorded in history. Under it the Parliament actually regulated the price of labour. That Act was&#39; in force in England up till the statutory law revision of 1S26, and it is an interesting example of how the Parliament of England, of which we are an offshoot, has asserted its right to decide even the question of the price of labour. Then again, there is the Statute of Apprentices which was passed in the reign of Elizabeth, and which recognises the customs of certain craft guilds well known to the common law of England, which were the prototypes and&#39; predecessors of modern trades unions. Under those guilds the masters were allowed to organize and associate themselves for the purpose of promoting their interests, and to make arrangements for the hours of labour and the number of apprentices to be employed. It is a curious fact that this apprentice question, of which we hear so much in modern times, has been the subject of controversy in England for hundreds of years. One would think from the way in which it is sometimes referred to in the press by well-meaning employers that it was an unparalleled act of tyranny for Parliament to interfere with the regulation of wages and the limitation of apprentices. Yet we find similar Acts right through the whole course of English history. Regarding these craft guilds, I believe that a great deal of the cleverness of English workmen of modern times may be traced back to them. They were the nuclei for the spreading of craft ability in connexion with all kinds of trades. At any rate, Parliament, in the reign of Elizabeth, actually legalized the rules of these craft guilds with reference to apprentices. That law remained operative for many years. It is interesting also to be reminded that we may read of such a thing as the mimimum wage in English history. . The first Act relating to this subject. was passed in the reign of Queen Anne, It provided that the mimimum wage of curates should be &#163;20 a year. </para>

              <para>- Yes they have, because in the reign of George III. the mimimum was raised to &#163;80 a year. To some honorable members these matters may be considered ancient history, but they are of peculiar interest in these times when we hear the honorable and learned member for Parkes declaring that this Bill represents a retrogade movement. In some of our old English laws there was a curious provision to the effect that whilst the masters and members of the guild could combine to keep up the price of their materials, and to limit the number df - their apprentices, the workmen could not do so. They were not permitted to combine for the purpose of increasing their own wages. Adam Smith mentions  that as a curious instance of antiquated law. He says - lt is not, however, difficult to see which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily ; and the law besides authorizes, or at least does not prohibit, their combination, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no Acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters could hold out much longer than the men. </para>

          <para>These are the views which are put forward by the father of political economy, the author of the <inline font-style="italic">Wealth qf Nations.</inline> at page 50, McCulloch&#39;s edition. But it is gratifying to know that that inequality in the law of England, to which Adam Smith referred, was removed from the Statute-book by the Act of 5, George IV. Chapter 59, 1824. By that Act the law prohibiting workmen from combining for lawful purposes - including the purpose of obtaining a rise in wages - was repealed. That marks the beginning of this new era about which we have heard so much. This Bill certainly does not do so. It may be traced back through English history to the repeal of that Act. </para>

              <para>- Probably. The Trades Union Act of 1871, and the Act of 1876 legalized combinations for trade purposes in England. This was the beginning of the modern legalization of trades unions. By the Employers&#39; Liability Act very valuable concessions were made to the workmen of England in the shape of provision for compensation in case of accident. But the Employers&#39; Liability and Workmen&#39;s Compensation Act of 1897 was certainly an innovation of a most advanced, progressive, and democratic kind. I wonder what would be said if a proposal of that kind were made in Australia ? We should have petitions, no doubt, of tho type and character which we have had to-day from the merchants of New South Wales, protesting against it as an unheard of innovation. We should be told, no doubt, that it would drive capital out of the country, and ruin the future prospects of the Commonwealth. What do we find in conservative England in relation to this measure which was brought in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> a member of a Conservative Government. It introduced an entirely new principle as to the liability of a master to his workmen. It was to the effect that the workmen engaged in certain trades and occupations should have the right to obtain compensation from their employers, whether there was negligence or not, in the case of accident resulting in injury. Under the old law, a workman could not obtain compensation from his master unless there was negligence or some breach of a statutory duty. But now, under this Act, the master is liable to compensate his servant to the extent, I believe, of three years&#39; pay, in case the servant suffers any injury whilst engaged in his employment. It is not necessary for the man to prove negligence, or any&#39; breach of duty against the master. He is not barred from right of action even if he is guilty of contributory negligence. </para>

              <para>- According to the English decisions the employer is to insure the safety of his workman from accident in the course of his work. I mention this matter as showing the drift of English &#39; legislation, which, although not on the lines of this Bill, is at any rate in the same direction. &#34;The whole trend of it is to ameliorate the condition of the workman, to place him on a footing of security, and to give him the protection of law. How does this principle square with the principle enunciated by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and the honorable member for Wentworth, that we should practically leave master and workman to settle their own affairs, and that it is not the duty of the State to intervene? Such a contention is contradictory to the whole course of English legislation, and also to the whole course of Australian legislation. I shall refer now to&#39; some Acts passed in the Victorian Parliament, which I believe led the way in legislation of a liberal character for the relief of workmen from some of the serious disabilities and dangers and harassing conditions under which they formerly laboured. The Regulation of Mines Acts is an enduring legislative monument to the liberalism, not only of the State of Victoria, but of its Parliament. So far back as 1S73, the Regulation of Mines Bill was brought in by the Honorable Angus Mackay, a predecessor of mine in the representation of Sandhurst in the State Parliament. He was a member of a Government which was supposed to contain a number of Conservatives, but that measure was one of the most liberal pieces of legislation, and showed such a sympathy for the working miner that it deserves to be mentioned in a debate of this character. I ought also to mention the names of those who years ago worked on the same lines - who laid the foundations for legislation such as this, and - rendered it possible. In the Regulation of Mines Act, the Parliament of Victoria prohibited the employment of women and boys in mines, and regulated the working hours of miners. That Act has been adopted by most of the State Legislatures of Australia. </para>

              <para>- Yes. How does that Act square with the principle that the State ought not to interf erein matters between master and workman ? It has worked well, and although there may have been a few murmurs at that time from timorous employers and mine-owners, who regarded it as an experiment, still, in the light of twenty years&#39; experience, I venture to say with the greatest confidence that no mineowner in Australia would be heard to-day to take any seriousobjection to its provisions. It is not only operative in the interests of workmen, but in the interests of mineowners, because the owner gets more work out of the min.er when the miner works under conditionsof safety, conditions of cleanliness, and conditions conducive to health - such as good ventilation and security of surroundings, as well as moderate hours. I have been informed by mine managers and owners that a miner working under favorable conditions such as these is able to do more work, and consequently he earns his wages in a much more satisfactory manner than if he were labouring under the old system of ten hours a day, and under conditions of insecurity. I regard the terms of that Act as the germ from which many of the leading provisions of this Bill have been evolved in the gradual process of development. I do not regard this Bill as being purely an experiment, which we should contemplate with doubt or misgivings. It is founded on principles which have already stood the test of time. We are not in an experimental stage ; we have rather reached the stage of universal approbation. The honorable member for Laanecoorie read a passage from the report of the Victorian Factories Commission - an impartial tribunal which included several members of the Legislative Council of Victoria, whose disposition would certainly not be in the direction of democratic legislation unless it were recommended by experience and had stood the test of time. We have it stated, in the passage read by the honorable member, that the principle of the New Zealand Act has stood the test of time, and is entitled to approbation. This is, therefore, no new era in our social legislation. I regard it merely as a development and an expansion - a new application of principles previously in force. The Victorian Factories Act itself, which instituted wages boards, was a piece of legislation of a pioneer character. </para>

              <para>- Yes. He would leave all to the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest. Within certain limits competition is a most healthy principle, but genuine competition is possible only where the competing parties possess a comparative equality of strength. Without equality of strength and of conditions there can be no competition - no fair competition -and the weak must be destroyed. It is said by some of our best modern thinkers, however, that the intervention of the State is justified, not only on philosophical, but even on economical grounds ; and that the State may legitimately intervene in order to equalize conditions, and to promote instead of destroying competition. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. &#34;Westall</inline> W.

          <para class="block">During the investigations of some of the Victorian Wages Boards many of the masters stated that, personally, they had no objection to the increasing of wages in their trades if they were not sure that it would lead to the loss of their export trade, because they would be unable to compete with manufacturers in some other States where there were no Wages Boards. They said - &#34;If the wages of our employes are increased, we shall have to shut up our factories altogether, or else remove to the other States.&#34; I have been informed by a gentleman who presided over at least three Wages Boards that overwhelming evidence was given to that effect. The employers objected to the intervention of the State until the introduction of Inter-State legislation, or the bringing about of uniformity of wages. They said that they did not object to the raising of wages if the employers of all the States were compelled to adopt the same standard. But what is their contention now&#39; I invite honorable members to read the circular which has been issued by the Inter-State Conference of the Chambers of Manufactures of all the States, held in Melbourne on the 11th and 12th of this month. No resolution was passed at that Conference objecting to the principle of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. The attitude the Conference took was that, as these disputes involve matters appertaining wholly to State legislation, there is no need for the intervention of the Federal authority. While, a few years ago, the Victorian manufacturers were asking for an Inter-State law, and urging the State authority to postpone action until there was a Federal law and uniformity of conditions, they say now - &#34; Leave us to the State law. Do not let the Federal authority interfere.&#34; That is an inconsistent attitude. They complain, too, of the possibility of being liable to two awards. They say that they may be compelled to comply with the award of the State board, and that upon the top of that award they may have to obey the award of the Commonwealth Court. I think it would be as well if they could receive an authoritative assurance that they will not, under any circumstances, be required to comply with two awards. It would be absurd if they had to do so. They could only be liable to obey the award of the Federal Court acting within the scope of its jurisdiction. </para>

              <para>- That brings me to the constitutional aspect of this question. The view I take of the constitutional power we possess is this : I believe that this Parliament has power to deal only with what may be described as Inter-State disputes, or disputes which extend over more than one State. I do not agree with the view that this Federal power may be exercised in such a way as I have seen suggested, namely, that some little dispute existing in one State might be made the basis of Federal jurisdiction, because of the mere possibility of the dispute ultimately extending beyond the State. I think that in such a case the Federal Court to be created by the Bill would not have any jurisdiction. In order to give the Court jurisdiction certain facts must be presented, showing, either that a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State actually exists, or that there are certain facts which prove reasonably, and almost conclusively, that a strike which will extend over at least two States is imminent. The mere existence of a dispute in one State would not be sufficient to give jurisdiction. I do not think that the Court could give itself jurisdiction merely by its own finding, unless there were facts which would justify that finding. The Court would not be able to give itself jurisdiction by a fiction, by finding facts which did exist, or merely by the issue of a certificate by the Registrar. The honorable member for Wentworth complained that the certificate of the Registrar was to be <inline font-style="italic">primd facie</inline> evidence of a dispute within the meaning of the Act, but, as I interjected, that would be merely <inline font-style="italic">prima facie,</inline> it would not be conclusive. I apprehend that it would be the duty of the Court to enter upon an inquiry, and . ascertain whether there were sufficient facts to give it jurisdiction. It would never do to allow the Court to give itself jurisdiction by finding facts which would not be examinable by a higher tribunal. I believe that if the Court found as a fact that there was a dispute within the meaning of the Act, and it turned out, after further investigation, that there was no dispute within the meaning of the Act, its finding could be set aside and quashed by the High Court. All inferior Courts which exceed their jurisdiction are liable to have their finding upset by the superior Court, so that a safeguard against any overlapping or duplication of award or usurpation of jurisdiction by the Arbitration Court will be afforded by the High Court, which will have control over all the inferior Courts. </para>

          <para class="block">If the Court of Arbitration should exceed its constitutional power its finding would be liable to be set aside. It is contended that the mere existence of a dispute in any one State might be sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction, because the Federal authority gives the power of prevention, which might be so utilized as to give jurisdiction over a dispute iu one State, merely because it might possibly spread into another. I think that the Federal power of prevention may be. interpreted in this way. Take the case of the Seamen&#39;s Union and the Steamship Owners&#39; Federation at the present time. They represent industrial organizations whose operations extend continuously over at least two or more States. That is a fair case to take, in order to illustrate my view of the power of prevention, lt is well known that the existing agreement is almost at an end, and that neither party will approach the other for the purpose of negotiating a new agreement. They are almost challenging each other. The employers are saying - &#34; Why do you not approach us with a suggestion?&#34; and the seamen are refusing to make any Suggestion. At present, no dispute exists between these bodies. There is no disagreement, because, on the one hand, no proposition has been made, and, on the other, no proposition has been rejected. A dispute means a disagreement or a controversy, so that, in my opinion, there is no dispute within the meaning of the Act. Now, the power of prevention of the Arbitration Court might be exercised in this way : Either the seamen on the one hand, or the employers on the other, might say - &#34; We refuse to approach the other side, and we shall go into the Arbitration Court and ask it to undertake a settlement of the question of wages between us in anticipation of a dispute.&#34; . There is no dispute and no controversy, but in order to prevent a dispute arising - in order to prevent matters reaching that stage - either party would have the power to ask the Court to cause the other side to be summoned, and to exercise its jurisdiction by settling the rate of wages, and thus preventing a dispute. That is my interpretation of the power of prevention ; namely, the power of intervention between the employer and the employed before they have arrived  at the stage of disagreement. That is a solution of the constitutional problem which, I think, is preferable to the view that the Federal authority has  the right to intervene simply &#39;because there is an industrial dispute in one State and before it has extended to another. Whilst we are disposed to view this question. with the greatest amount of generosity, with the greatest desire to give effect to the legal power to prevent disputes, I think that we ought to confine ourselves strictly within the limits of the Constitution. No desire should be exhibited to exceed those limits. Whilst we are to some extent groping in the dark to ascertain the exact extent of our powers, we should be careful to limit the operation of this Bill to industrial disputes which unquestionably extend from one State into another. If we do that, there can be no ground for complaint, as is alleged in the circular of the Employers&#39; Union, that this Federal power is being utilized for the purpose of settling disputes which properly come within tbe jurisdiction of the States authorities. I do not think that this House has any desire to usurp powers which can be efficiently exercised by the States Parliaments. I believe that the Victorian Parliament is quite able to legislate for the prevention of industrial disputes within its own borders, and the same remark is applicable to the other States. Let us confine our efforts to the settlement of disputes which unquestionably are of an Inter-State character. If we do so I believe that we shall serve a very useful purpose. We shall remove complaints such as those made to the Victorian Boards before the possibility of Federal legislation upon the subjoct became apparent. At the same time, our aotion will tend towards bringing about uniform conditions as to wages and labour which are most desirable in the cose of industries that are common to two or more States. The result will be to conserve the interests of those whose capital is- invested in industrial enterprises, and also to benefit the workmen. We shall thus exercise our Federal power in a manner which will disappoint those croakers who are now indulging in prophecies of ruin and disaster. They are only repeating the old forebodings of Herbert Spencer, and of the old advocates of Darwinianism in politics, which have not- been fulfilled. On the contrary, it has been conclusively proved that wherever this liberal legislation has been adopted in Englishspeaking communities it has been fairly utilized, both by employers and employes. It has tended rather to the encouragement of enterprise, affording security to workmen and employer, tending to the amelioration of the conditions of the people, and adding an impulse to civilization generally. </para>
