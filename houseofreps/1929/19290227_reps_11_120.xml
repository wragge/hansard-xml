            <para>- The honorable member advised me in advance of his intention to ask this question, and I have been able to get the information for him. The system of sorting mail matter for certain places in north-western Victoria was rearranged on the 9th February, and necessarily some delay in the work occurred until the sorters could become familiar with the new conditions. Normal conditions have prevailed in the branch since the 16th February. The change entailed the working of a certain amount of overtime, which could not be obviated, because trained officers were necessary for the work. The men who were required to work from 9.30 a.m. till 9.30 p.m., had breaks of two hours daily for meals ; consequently, the amount of overtime duty they performed was two hours per day. </para>

            <para>- A settler in Central Australia has reported to me that the police constable stationed at Arltunga is engaged in searching for a native murderer, but that owing to the drought no horses are available for his expedition. Will the Minister for Home Affairs ascertain whether that statement is correct, and, if it is, issue instructions that the constable be supplied with camels or preferably a motor car, so that he may be better equipped to perform his duties? </para>

            <para>- On several occasions the prices charged for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, have been mentioned in this House, and some months ago I asked the Development and Migration Commission to ascertain definitely how the prices charged in Australia compare with those charged in other countries. As a result of its investigations, the Commission has reported that the price charged in Australia for superphosphates is higher than that in any other country. As superphosphate and other fertilizers are essential to the development of the primary industries, the Government has asked the Tariff Board to investigate fully the prices charged in Australia and report as early as possible. </para>

              <para>- The Arbitration Act provides that secret application may be made to the registrar for a secret ballot in a certain manner. It is an offence for the registrar to disclose in the case of one of these applications, such as the application in the present timber workers&#39; case, the names of the applicants or any particulars concerning them, to any person except the judge. It rests with the registrar and the judge to satisfy themselves of the bona fides of the applicants. It is by the legislation passed by this Parliament that these matters are left to be dealt with by the court in the manner mentioned. </para>

That statement was challenged by the honorable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Culley),</inline> who spoke as a member of the conference of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. In the daily press, the honorable gentleman is reported to have said that he threw the lie back in my teeth. I assure the House that my statement was made in good faith and was based on reports which appeared in a number of newspapers. So far as I am aware, all the newspaper reports of the conference were to the same effect. I propose to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report of the conference, and I feel certain that the honorable member for Denison will then realize that if I made a misstatement, I did so without malice. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 3rd October, 1928, a motion was submitted to the conference by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> S. Garden, Secretary of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, and seconded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> O&#39;Neill, of the Victorian Branch of the Seamen&#39;s Union, in which it was decided to instruct all workers to refrain from taking out licences, and to form councils of action in each State. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> report stated, further, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Gibson, a member of the Emergency Committee of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which body had convened the conference, moved an amendment that the best policy to adopt was to accept the inevitable and advise all unionist waterside workers to apply immediately for licences under the obnoxious Transport Workers Act. </para>

            <para>- With reference to the -statutory rule tabled last week, containing amendments of previous statutory rules, which provide, among other things, that the War Service Homes Commissioner may, if in his opinion it is desirable, appoint a board of inquiry to hear and report upon any charge made in accordance with regulation 6 of these regulations, I ask the Treasurer who is to constitute such a board? Will it consist of a  chairman  and other members, and will the personnel of the board include a representative of the employees? What fees are to be paid to the members of the board and will any member of it be independent of the department? </para>

            <para>.- I take this opportunity to place this subject before the House again because it is of a very urgent nature, and because I desire to call the attention of the Government to the necessity for making immediate provision for the building of the line. My two reasons for adopting the course that I have taken to-day in moving the adjournment of the House are, firstly, that the line will provide facilities needed by the district that it will serve, and, secondly, that acute unemployment obtains in South Australia at the present time, and there is no other avenue, apart from the construction of this railway, wherein the unemployed could be absorbed. The work is long overdue. It was referred to the Public Works Committee in the early months of 1926. I was a member of the committee then, and we understood that our inquiries into this line had to be expedited. We hastened the investigation as far as possible, and, in May, 1926, our report was printed. Prior to that an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government. In the limited time at my disposal I do not intend to discuss the terms of that agreement ; but I refer to it to show that there is no obstacle in the way of proceeding with the work so far as South Australia is concerned. The agreement has been ratified by this Parliament and also by the South Australian Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The matter was then held up for some time; but, to show that it was still before the Government, I remind honorable members that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. .Earle. Page)</inline> referred- to it in his budget-speech in 1927, in these terms - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Under the Railways (South Australian) Agreement Act 192G, provision is made for the extension of the 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge from Port Augusta to Adelaide to enable the Commonwealth trains to run between Kalgoorlie and Adelaide. The work has been recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Works, and the necessary bill for the construction of the railway will be introduced during the present session. The breaks of gauge at Port Augusta und Terowie have greatly hampered and restricted business, and it is expected tli.it the extension of a uniform gauge to Adelaide will considerably increase the traffic. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those remarks show that the Government realized the necessity for action at that time. I recently asked the Prime Minister if he would expedite the passage of the necessary legislation to enable the construction of the line to proceed. He replied that the work could not be done this year, because there was no loan money available for the purpose. I believe that the reply given by the Prime Minister was not quite accurate, as our Estimates for the year ended 30th June, 1929, provided money for the construction of this railway. Those Estimates also contained provision for the expenditure of &#163;300,000 for &#34;Advances of passage money, landing money, and medical fees of assisted immigrants &#34; ; and that when our unemployed are legion! The necessity of the moment is not to spend money on immigration, but to relieve existing unemployment; migration activities- should be temporarily suspended. I remind the  Prime  Minster that, on the 3rd November, 1927, I asked him in this House, if, because of the great amount of unemployment which then existed in South Australia, the Government would place as much Commonwealth work as possible in operation in that State, without delay, with a view to alleviating the unemployment problem in South Australia, and the right honorable gentleman replied - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whenever, through <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> local circumstances, a period of unemployment occurs in a State, the Commonwealth endeavours to relieve it by pushing on with Commonwealth works that have been authorized in that State. The last instance of the kind was, I think, furnished when certain representations were made by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> regarding Commonwealth works in that city. I can assure tlie honorable member for Grey that that policy will be pursued in the present case, if unemployment is acute. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Unemployment is acute in South Australia at present. It has never been worse, and I know of no other State in Australia in which it is as bad, so tha the time is opportune for the Prime Minister to redeem his promise. I hope tha I shall be able to convince both the Prime &#34;Minister and the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> that the project is of so urgent a nature that the Government would be well advised if it introduced a special loan bill to provide the necessary money immediately. It is not that money will be thrown away on this railway, as the line will pay from the outset. On several occasions, I have enumerated the advantages that would result from its construction, and I shall now briefly reiterate the salient features of the scheme. The length of construction necessary from Port Augusta to Red Hill is 82 miles. Work could be started simultaneously at three points, Red Hill, Port Augusta, and Port Pirie. Already there is a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railway running from Adelaide to Red Hill. Red Hill- is approximately 28 miles from Port Pirie, and the route to Port Augusta ia 58 miles from Port Pirie. The proposal is io continue the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge from Red Hill to Port Pirie, and to lay along that section of the line a third rail, to provide a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge line. The 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge railway would be continued from Port Pirie to Port Augusta, so making a continuous length of 4-ft. 8^-in. railway from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide, and a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge railway from Port Pirie to Adelaide. </para>
          <para>The bill for the construction of this railway was introduced in this House on the 12th October, 1927, by the honorable member for Echuca <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hill),</inline> who was then Minister for Works and Railways. The necessary surveys have been made, and the work could now be proceeded with immediately. When introducing the bill in 1927, the then Minister said, amongst other things - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The bill before tlie House gives the cost of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill only, but the Honorable the Treasurer will also make provision as may, be necessary for the expenditure on rolling-stock and on the third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide, and the sums necessary for these works will be provided for and submitted to this House with the Estimates in the usual way. </para>

          <para class="block">It is really unnecessary for me to elaborate those very sound reasons in favour of the railway, but I shall amplify them by pointing out that evidence was tendered to the Public Works Committee to the effect that the country between Red Hill and Port Pirie contains some of the best agricultural land that is to be found in South Australia, while from Port Pirie on, the land is very suitable. Evidence on the subject also indicates that those engaged in the wheat industry in the district concerned are considerably hampered because their product has to be carted a distance of 22 miles from Wandearah to Port Pirie. This line would pass through a district which has an assured rainfall and has seldom had a crop failure. Evidence on that point was given before the Public Works Committee. Many railways are constructed with a view to developing country and do not pay. I am in favour of building railways whether they pay or not, if they lead to greater production and to an increase in settlement, and I should be justified in asking for the construction of this line solely because of the development it would bring about. I propose, however, to show that it will be a payable proposition. The estimated cost of the line is &#163;735,000, the rolling-stock required to serve the section from Port Augusta to Adelaide is estimated to cost &#163;104,250, and the third rail between Red Hill and the Adelaide railway station, &#163;380,000, making a total of &#163;1,219,250. The Commonwealth Railways anticipated from the railway between Port Augusta, Red Hill and Adelaide an annual revenue of &#163;101,000. The annual working expenses are set down at &#163;64,000, and the annual interest charges on the same basis at &#163;78,000, leaving an estimated annual loss on the working of the Commonwealth trains and traffic between Port Augusta and Adelaide of approximately &#163;41,000. But against this it is estimated that by the building of this line the financial results of the Trans- Australian railway will be improved to the extent of &#163;35,000, and that because of the extra traffic which will come from the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway there will be a gain of &#163;13,000. The line will, therefore, show an actual profit of about &#163;7,000 per annum, after paying working expenses and interest. Those figures are not mine; they were given by the then Minister for Works and Railways in moving the second reading of the bill for the construction of this railway. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The proposal is to take the stock trains from Quorn to Port Augusta and water the stock there before sending them on in a through train to Adelaide. At present, stock from the north have to be detrained at- several points on the journey from Alice Springs to Adelaide, but by travelling by the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway these changes would be avoided, ten hours on the journey would be saved, and the cattle would not be knocked about to the extent they are at present. The national aspect of this proposed railway has been emphasized on many previous occasions. The line would popularize the East-West service. I have on a previous occasion mentioned that I have known passengers from Perth booked through to Adelaide, to leave the train at Port Augusta and continue the journey to Adelaide by bus, their object being to gain an additional six hours in that city. With the construction of the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway, Adelaide would be reached by train nine hours earlier than is now possible. These advantages are all pointed out in the report of the Public Works Committee. I trust that the Government will realize that if ever there was a time when it should come to the assistance of South Australia, it is the present. I have received numerous letters and telegrams urging that something should be done by the Commonwealth to relieve the unemployment trouble in South Australia. </para>

          <para>Ministers have already entered into an agreement with the South Australian Government to build the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway, and from time to time they have expressed their anxiety to proceed with the work because of the many advantages that would follow its completion. Surely it is time for them to take steps to secure these advantages and at the same time help to relieve the unemployed difficulty now existing in South Australia. There are in that State 1,500 returned soldiers and 7,000 other persons out of employment. Every town has a considerable number of people unemployed. There are, for instance, 400 men in Port Pirie out of work. Some men are unemployed for a. time and then secure work for a while, but I know men at Port </para>
          <para class="block">Pirie who have not had employment for two years. A large number of men were thrown on the labour market by the Butler Government under the State railways rehabilitation scheme. Some of them have done no work since ; others have had &#39;a few days&#39; work each month, but have not earned sufficient to maintain their families. Committees in Port Pirie are doing all they possibly can to relieve the distress there, but I am afraid that the position will gradually grow worse. Most of the South Australian wheat crop is on; the water, and what is not on the water is on the wharf waiting shipment; the fruit season is over, seasonal occupations generally are finished and the completion of the construction work on the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs railway will throw an additional 600 men on the labour market in June next. The position, therefore, instead of improving, will grow gradually worse. The honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> when speaking a few days ago did not exaggerate the condition of affairs in Port Adelaide. No one could exaggerate it. An honorable member representing another State has shown me a letter written to him telling him of families in South Australia who are living on bran because they cannot afford to buy any other food. According to the Port Pirie <inline font-style="italic">Recorder,</inline> a speaker at &#187; meeting held the other night said that he knew of a child that had died because the family breadwinner, being out of work, could not buy proper nourishment for it. Councillor Coffey, of that town, said that the men at Port Pirie did not&#39; want a dole, but would welcome work, and&#39; that at present many were living on one meal&#39; a day, slowly starving because their pride would not allow them to join the bread line. The Rev. Lade, a man who has done good work assisting the unemployed and relieving the distress at Port Pirie, says that 85 per cent, of those who wait on him want work and not charity. The secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation stated, also, that he knew of many waterside workers who were earning from 14s. to 15s. a week. These men are mostly married, and their wage does not pay their rent. How are they to keep their wives and families? There are on the books of the Waterside Workers Federation to-day three times as many men as can be given assistance. At times there is no work offering at all for the waterside workers. The unemployment in the northern parts of South Australia is being increased because of the action of the Government of that State. The Premier, obviously to stop the demonstrations by the unemployed in the capital -city, has offered the unemployed free railway passes to any place 120 miles from Adelaide. Men are taking advantage of that offer, and, as there is no work in the country, they are in a very bad way. According to statements in the press and by the Premier of South Australia, there is the prospect of a few small public works being undertaken in the near future ; but it is almost certain that most of the money available for those works will be expended in the purchase of material, and little employment will be offering. </para>
          <para>This Government should honor its promise to construct the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway. This work should be put in hand immediately, because it would not only relieve unemployment, but also confer a great benefit on the farmers in the northern parts of South Australia, who have experienced four successive droughts. In 1914 these settlers experienced a severe drought, but were able to carry on and keep their stock alive by work on the transcontinental railway, which was then being constructed, At present no work is offering and they are unable to buy feed for their stock. Our unemployed :to-day are being forced to accept charity. I agree with the statement of the Rev. Lade that the unemployed want, not charity, but the opportunity to earn sufficient to keep themselves and their families. Not only are the workers suffering, but the whole of the community is feeling the ill-effects of unemployment. The Government, to show that its sympathies are with the workers and the nation as a whole, should commence the construction of this railway, which from the first day of its operation, will pay working expenses and interest and show an annual profit of &#163;7,000. If the Government side-tracks this project that will be tantamount to saying, &#34;Let the thousands who are starving continue to starve.&#34; I hope that the Government </para>
          <para>Ifr. <inline font-style="italic">Lacey.</inline> will give immediate consideration to my suggestion and put this work in hand in the near future. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to congratulate the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> on the forceful way in which he has presented his case to the House. Almost his first statement was that the Commonwealth should, for the time being, suspend immigration in view of the considerable unemployment existing in Australia at present. It cannot be too often emphasized that this is a matter entirely for the States, and that not one single assisted migrant has been brought here at the initiative of the Commonwealth. There are only two channels through which the assisted migrant may come here, the requisition and the nomination channels. Either there must be direct requisition on the part of a State Government, or nomination on . the part of citizens, whose nominations have to be endorsed by the respective State Governments before the Commonwealth can take action regarding them, so that the responsibility for the. admission of migrants whose passages are assisted rests entirely with the States. That fact cannot be too often repeated. </para>

          <para>Provision would probably have been made before this to commence the construction of the line from Red Hill to Port Augusta, had it not been for the grave necessity which arose last year for reducing to a minimum all loan programmes, federal and State. There is, I think, little or no difference of opinion among honorable members on either side of the House as to the advantages which will accrue from the building of this line. The present line, at an . altitude of some 2,000 feet, follows a tortuous track over the Flinders Range. The new project will be better in every respect. It will reduce the time of the journey between Adelaide and Port Augusta by some five hours, and the distance by some 70 miles. The altitude will be reduced from 2,000 feet to 455 feet. In addition, when this project is carried out, and if the third rail is laid, or, alternately, the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge only is used, two breaks of gauge will be obviated. The Minister who preceded me in my present office introduced a bill, the year before last, to authorize the construction of this line, but it did not get beyond the second reading stage, because of the pressure of legislation at the close of the session. Shortly after that a period of extraordinary financial stringency ensued and it became necessary for the Commonwealth and State Governments to cut down ruthlessly their loan programmes. Honorable members opposite were then most insistent in their demands for a reduction in loan expenditure, and on the hustings they had a good deal to say on that subject. The cost of this line is estimated at &#163;735,000, plus &#163;104,000 for rolling-stock and &#163;380,000 for the laying, at Commonwealth expense, of&#39; a third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide. In addition, the State Government, would be put to the expense of laying a. third rail from Red Hill to Port Pirie. Although the Uniform Gauge Committee, which met in 1921, recommended the building of this line as a part of the scheme for the unification of gauges, South Australia did not participate in the proposals for a uniform gauge. The undertaking which the honorable member for Grey has referred to this afternoon is, strictly speaking, not an agreement between the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments which is binding on either party, it merely gives a permissive right which the Commonwealth  Govermnent  may make use of at any time. Since that arrangement was made, a new factor has arisen* The subject of unifying the gauges in Victoria and South Australia has been given prominence in the report of the British Economic Mission, the members of which referred to the possibility of amending what is known as the &#163;34,000,000 agreement in such a way as to make its funds available for the unification of gauges. Needless to say, if that were done, the cost of this project would be lowered enormously. We should get from Great Britain money for the first five years at half the normal rate of interest, and for the second five years at two-thirds of the normal rate of interest. If the proposal of the British Economic Mission comes to fruition, with the prospect of greatly reduced costs, and South Australia becomes favorable to the conversion of its railways to a uniform gauge, the necessity for the laying of the third rail from Red Hill to Adelaide at Commonwealth expense, and from Red Hill to Port Pirie at that State&#39;s expense would disappear and an enormous saving would be made. The whole project would be immensely simplified. Apart from the necessity of refraining from borrowing, we had the best of reasons for making a pause at this juncture before the Commonwealth commits itself to the building of a third rail project at heavy expense. The Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and of the States on the mainland are, on instructions from the Commonwealth and State Governments now engaged in investigating the present cost of carrying out the modified conversion scheme which would change the railways of South Australia and Victoria to the 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge. When their report is available all the Governments concerned will be in an infinitely better position than they are in to-day to determine what action they should take and whether the third rail project should be scrapped. It must be evident to all honorable members that if the unification of gauges becomes a subject of practical politics as a result of the proposals which have been put forward, and which may result in immense savings being made in interest costs, the expenditure on the Red Hill to Port Augusta railway will be considerably reduced. For these reasons I trust that the House will not decide to take such precipitate action as has been proposed by the honorable member for Grey. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister, in answer to a question asked in this House recently, said that the whole question was governed by the amount of loan moneys available, and that he could hold out no prospect of the railway being proceeded with during the present financial year. He also said that the project will receive full consideration when the Government is framing its financial policy for next year. In view of the possibility of the unification of gauges being proceeded with in the near future on a basis which would be much more advantageous to Australia than any other previously contemplated, we should do well to pause until we receive the report of the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and States on the cost of unifying the gauges. </para>

            <para>.- The reply of the Minister to the plea of the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> is totally inadequate and extremely pitiful. He has advised us to postpone the building of the railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta until the report of the Railways Commissioners on the unification of gauges is available. The motion for the adjournment of the  Hou3e,  although it relates to the construction of that railway, has one specific purpose, and that is to provide employment for the workers of Australia. To-day men and women are starving and children are being fed with bran. The Government does not care one jot. The Minister wishes us to postpone giving relief to these people until some decision has been come to respecting the unification of gauges. We should grasp the nettle firmly, and take immediate action to relieve the distress existing throughout this country. The Minister took the honorable member for Grey to task for his suggestion that migration to this country should cease. The Minister knows that we should cease to assist migration. Any one with a grain of common sense knows that. We have no right to bring men here until we can usefully employ every working member of the community. The Minister is evading the issue by saying that the States and not the Commonwealth are responsible for bringing migrants here, The Commonwealth supplies the sinews of war to the States. If this Government refused to make funds available to the States for immigration purposes, immigration would cease immediately. We are wasting money not only in bringing migrants here, but also in inviting them here. I have before me a Scotch newspaper containing an advertisement inviting people to come to Australia, the land of opportunity. A similar advertisement appears in almost every newspaper of Great Britain. The honorable member for Grey has told us of the distress that exists at Port Pirie among the miners, who, in prosperous times, helped the mine-owners to make enormous profits. Not only are the people of Port Pirie suffering, but tradespeople and other members of the community are feeling the pinch. The honorable member for Grey has put forward  a  practical proposition. He has asked the Government to carry out a portion of the policy which it enunciated on the public platforms of this country. The construction of this railway would not only relieve unemployment, but would benefit the people on the land who are  at  present  in  the throes of a drought. The Minister took refuge behind the statement that loan expenditure must be reduced to a minimum. Was the last Budget of the Treasurer framed with  that  object  in view?  The right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr, Hughes)</inline> said in this House &#34; The road from Goulburn to Canberra shakes up my liver. We must make a bitumen road.&#34; and the Government supinely asked Parliament to spend over &#163;100,000 on that road. If that expenditure would have the same result as the honorable member for Grey anticipates from the construction of the Port Augusta to Red Hill railway, I would not mind the liver of the right honorable member for North Sydney being protected. But I want the people in Port Pirie to have an opportunity to earn  a  living. The  Minister  for Transport said that migration is the responsibility of the States, not of the Commonwealth. I ask him what would happen if the Commonwealth Government decided to proceed no further with the &#163;34,000,000 scheme which it has arranged with the British Government. If the flow of migrants were stopped immediately the Commonwealth would be able to find work for the people who are  already  in Australia. He spoke with his tongue in his cheek when he said that the control of this matter was beyond the Commonwealth. The statement that  the  Government cannot find money for an urgent railway project is in keeping with  its other  actions recently. Rather than pay a living allowance to certain postal officers in Canberra, it asked this Parliament  to disallow  the Arbitrator&#39;s award and to declare that he had made a mistake. Yet an extra &#163;2,000 can be found for the Governor-General and a home can be bought for the High Commissioner. When the Government is asked to make money available to build  a  railway and succour some of our people, the Minister for Transport pleads poverty. The honorable member for Grey has merely asked the Government to carry out its  policy, and it may do that without fear, because this project was approved by the Public Works Committee years ago, and a bill for the construction of the line was actually introduced into the House. The Minister&#39;s explanation of the situation was not entirely frank. The reason for delay is not the shortage of money. </para>

              <para>- It has a mandate to proceed with this work, and the line should and could be built. When it is completed we shall have the advantage of a continuous 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge from Port Augusta to Adelaide, and travellers will be spared the discomforts attendant on the present breaks of gauge. The Government recommended the South Brisbane to Kyogle railway to Parliament as a step towards the unification of gauges. The House assented to that policy, which is in accordance with the wishes of the people. The project for which the honorable member for Grey has pleaded is another and more important instalment of the uniform gauge. The Minister &#39; cannot deny the facts quoted by the honorable member, because they are the result of a complete investigation, and were, indeed, the basis of the bill introduced by the Government. We are told that the Railway Commissioners are now considering the possibility of unifying the gauges between the capital cities of Australia. If the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill were built on the 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge, all that would be needed to extend that gauge to Adelaide would be to lay a third rail on the existing 5-ft. 3-in. track. </para>

When the Fisher Government extended the 3-f t. 6-in. gauge from Pine Creek southwards, the track and culverts were so formed that at any time the gauge could be widened to 4-ft. 8-J-in. without undue cost. Surely it would not cost &#163;380,000 to lay a third rail on a wide track that is already built. In any case that expenditure will not be obviated by waiting for a decision regarding the unification of gauges; the third rail will have to be laid some time. </para>

              <para>- The Minister&#39;s argument will not bear investigation. If he is sincere in his statement that delay has been due to the fact that consideration was being given to the unification of gauges, then the question of cost is not involved. If unification be decided upon the third rail between Adelaide and Red Hill will be in line with that policy. The work on that section of the main line will have been done. This disposes of the Minister&#39;s contention that the work should not be proceeded with until the Commonwealth and States concerned have agreed about the policy of unification. Financial reasons are not so much involved as the Minister would have us believe. Money can be made available readily enough for the payment of a pension of &#163;1,000 a year to an exgovernor of the Commonwealth Bank, but when it comes to providing loan moneys for a work that will provide employment for those urgently in need of it, objections are raised in certain quarters. I hope that honorable members will support the motion. </para>

            <para>.- It is not my intention to take up the time of the House by prolonging this debate, because the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> has put up a splendid case in support of the proposed railway. He has shown clearly that the line, will be reproductive, and therefore honorable members should support the proposal. I was rather disappointed with the statement of the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson)</inline> concerning the use of loan moneys. It is inconsistent to place obstacles in the way of spending loan moneys for essential services, such as the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill, and at the same time to make loan provision for the building of a road for the convenience, as the honorable member for Adelaide said, of the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes when travelling between Sydney and Canberra. I am in favour of this proposed work being constructed without unnecessary delay. We are all agreed that the time has come when Australia must call a halt in the expenditure of loan money on undertakings that are not likely to be reproductive. But there are special reasons why the Government should proceed with this work. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The honorable member for Adelaide spoke of the great amount of unemployment in South Australia, particularly among the wage-earning section of the community. I remind honorable members that there are thousands of farmers who, with their wives and children, are subsisting on what is virtually a starvation ration to-day. It is essential that, in their interests as well as in the interests of unemployed workers in South Australia, this railway project should be proceeded with as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>.- In the short time at the disposal of honorable members, it is impossible adequately to deal with the motion of the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey).</inline> If the honorable member&#39;s intention is to urge on the Government the necessity of proceeding with the railway proposal in question I shall support the motion. On the other hand, if his object is to censure the Government for not having put the work in hand, &#91;cannot vote for his motion. The honorable member was extremely temperate in his remarks. He adduced sound, local reasons why the work should be proceeded with. There are ,also solid national reasons why the. construction of the railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill should have been proceeded with before now. I am not altogether satisfied with the reply of the Minister for Markets and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> In particular, I do not agree with his reason tha,t a shortage of loan money should have been responsible for the delay. If all the facts had been taken into consideration by the Government, Ministers must have been aware that leading railway authorities regarded this proposal as a reproductive undertaking. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner in particular advanced many sound reasons for the early construction of the railway. I think the Minister was on sounder ground when he urged that there should be complete agreement 01:1  the unification of railway gauges before the Government put this work in hand. We are all alive to the urgent need for unification at the earliest possible moment, but I disagree with the honorable member for Adelaide, when he says that if the third rail is laid it will be a comparatively simple matter to link up this. section when unification is decided on. If there were a possibility of an agreement to unify the gauges of all main lines, the Government would be justified in delaying the construction of this particular work, involving as it does the laying of a third rail, but I should like to see&#39; more evidence of agreement among the States concerning this problem. If unanimity is not likely to be reached within the next twelve or eighteen months, the Government will not be justified in holding up this work any longer. What is the attitude of the Government of South Australia? It seems to me that if the State Government had been keen about putting the work in hand, the Commonwealth Government might have been stirred to action long before now. Unquestionably, the people of South Australia are deeply interested in this proposal, which received the careful attention of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I happened to be  chairman  of the committee at the time, and with other members of that body made an exhaustive inquiry into the proposal. We examined 42 witnesses, including the Railways Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, as well as a considerable number of independent railway engineers. I think I am justified in saying that no fewer than thirteen engineers favoured the introduction of the third rail, as against five engineers who were doubtful of or opposed to the installation. I suggest that honorable members should peruse the evidence taken by the Public Works Committee, so that they may inform their minds on the various aspects of the project. Lengthy negotiations were entered into between the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments, and the agreement reached was ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliament of the State concerned. Under this agreement the Commonwealth undertook to build a railway on the 4-ft. 8 1/2-in.  gauge from Port Augusta to Red Hill, and the South Australian Government became responsible for the laying of a third rail at the expense of the Commonwealth on thu standard gauge on the line from Red </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Hill to Adelaide, a distance of 103 miles. It has been said that the technical advisers of the South Australian Government were opposed to the third rail. That statement is entirely contrary to fact. The Public Works Committee took a good deal of evidence on this point. If time permitted I could quote extensively from the evidence of the Chief Railways Commissioner for South Australia to show that in his view at all events, the laying of the third rail would not interfere with the safe working in station yards along the route or in Adelaide itself. Some honorable members not now in the House, were under the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb</inline> opposed the scheme entirely. That is not correct. It is true that he believed the Commonwealth was getting the better of the arrangement because it would be possible for the Commonwealth train to run right through from Kalgoorlie to Adelaide, and .the State would lose a certain amount of traffic. Doubtless there was something to support this view, but it is entirely a mistake to suppose that he objected to the laying of the third rail. As a return for this concession the Commonwealth Government agreed to introduce a third rail on their 4-ft. 8 1/2-in. gauge line at the expense of South Australia, from Red Hill to a point near Port Pirie, thus enabling South Australian rolling stock to run right through from Adelaide and the western, railway division to Port Pirie. It will be seen that the agreement presented features favourable to both Governments, though probably the Commonwealth stood to gain more than the State. In view of the important issues involved, I hope that the Government will make up its mind about the proposed unification of gauges or as an alternative that the proposed railway from Port Augusta to Red Hill will be put in hand at an early date. In rendering financial assistance to the States of Queensland and New South Wales in connexion with the broad gauge railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane, the Commonwealth has shown its desire to bring about unification of our rail systems. I look forward to the time when we shall have an opportunity to discuss the pro&#93;!0.*al for a third rail, with which many people arc, as yet, unfamiliar. </para>

            <para>.- It is unfortunate that the time at our disposal for the discussion of this important matter is so short. From the speeches already made it would appear that members generally are agreed as to the advisability of constructing a railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta. I urge the Government to make available the money necessary for the construction of this line, in order not only to provide a railway which will be a national asset, but also to relieve the distress which now exists in South Australia because of unemployment. I remind the House of the promise contained in the Prime Minister&#39;s policy speech delivered in 1925 - </para>

              <para>-  I rise to a point of order. Your decision, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> has placed me an an invidious position, for I should not have risen to speak had I thought that by so doing I would deprive the House of an opportunity to vote on this motion. Seeing that by the clock in the chamber there were still several minutes left, and as I was desirous of expressing my views as to the advisability of constructing a railway from Red Hill to Port Augusta, I availed myself of the opportunity to support the motion. I certainly intended to resume my seat in time to allow a vote to be taken, and I thought that I had done so. I trust that even now we shall not be deprived of an opportunity to divide. </para>

            <para>- There are no gazettals of wire of British manufacture under the act mentioned. Wire netting from the United Kingdom is so gazetted under section 4 of the act, which only applies when the goods are sold for export at a lower price than the value for home consumption. If these goods are so dumped in Australia there seems to be no reason why the dumping duties provided for by the act should not apply. </para>

          <para class="block">This measure is to provide for the appointment of a Wine Export Marketing Board to be elected by those engaged in the wine-making industry, and to be clothed with statutory powers similar to those enjoyed by the Dried Fruits Export Control Board and the Dairy Produce Export Control Board. </para>
          <para>That the Australian wine-making industry is becoming increasingly important may be judged by the growth of our exports. Before the payment of a wine bounty was commenced in 1924, our exports were in the neighbourhood of 800,000 gallons a year, practically the whole of which consisted of dry wines. Until then Australian manufacturers had not been exporting sweet wine, or, if they had, the quantity was negligible. In 1925-26,. owing largly to the impetus given to the industry by the payment of a wine bounty, our exports increased to 1,700,000 gallons, and during the year 1926-27 they reached 3,077,000 gallons. In 1927-28 Australia exported 3,770,000 gallons. The exports to which I have just referred were undertaken in a more or less haphazard manner, each exporter being a law unto himself. Up to the present there hasbeen little or no co-ordination of effort, and the lack of marketing organization was particularly felt in 1927. In April of that year the late Minister for </para>
          <para class="block">Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> in introducing a bill to provide for the payment of a reduced bounty, indicated that, while the Government was prepared to continue the bounty, which would expire on the 31st August of that year, it would be at the reduced rate of ls. a gallon. &#34;From the time that announcement was made until the reduction became effective the winemakers generally strained every effort to take advantage of the higher rate of bounty on the wines they exported, and that resulted in the shipment of huge quantities of wine. Some was despatched on consignment iu the hope of purchasers being found at the other end. A large quantity was purchased by speculators not actually engaged in the industry, who had no clientele to whom they could sell the wine, and merely bought it on the chance of the price of Australian wine advancing with the reduction in the bounty. Little or no advertising was undertaken by those engaged in the industry to endeavour to increase the demand for Australian wine, and to bring it up to a point which would conform <inline font-style="italic">more closely to</inline> the huge growth of the export trade. The result was that, in 1927, the huge excess of our exports over and above the quantity, great though it was, that went into consumption in Great Britain was almost entirely responsible for the glut on the London market, which since that date has to a great extent reduced the demand for this wine. </para>

              <para>- I propose an export board, similar to the existing boards, with a London agency. That glut has been cleared to. some extent, but if we are to dispose of our large exportable surplus profitably, if those engaged in the industry are to advertise it on an adequate scale, and if a repetition of the chaotic condition that has prevailed in the industry for some time is to be prevented, proper marketing organization, particularly in connexion with the export trade, is essential. I believe that that view is now generally accepted. In December last, at a meeting of the Commonwealth Board of Trade in Sydney, the situation of the industry was discussed, and a resolution to the following effect was carried: - </para>

            <para>Despite the so-called &#34; crisis &#34; in the Australian wine trade in the United Kingdom the demand in that country appears to have been maintained, the consumption during the eleven months of 1928 to the end of November totalling 1,912,000 gallons- a loss of 150,000 gallons on the year, and there still remained the seasonal Christmas demand to satisfy. A writer in the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> points out that this further indicates that the responsibility for the present state of business rests with the trade itself, and adds weight to the movement for &#34; rationalisation.&#34; In many influential quarters in London it is held that a con trol of exports from Australia by the wine industry itself is the only way to stabilize prices, improve quality, and control vintages - so far as that is humanly possible. </para>

          <para class="block">To obtain the opinion held by those concerned in the industry in Australia, I called a conference early in January of persons engaged in making wine and in growing grapes for wine-making. At that gathering all sections of the industry were represented - both  wine-makers  and growers - and it was resolved unanimously that an export board on similar lines to those of the existing export control boards should be established and clothed with similar statutory powers. </para>
          <para>We now come to consider the kind of board to be set up and the powers that should be delegated to it. This measure is framed much on the lines of the Dairy Produce and Dried Fruits Export Control Acts. It is provided in the bill that before the measure becomes operative a ballot of the wine makers engaged in  the  industry shall be taken to determine whether a majority of them are in favour of the board&#39;s establishment. We have very strong evidence, as will be seen from the result of the conference held in Melbourne, to which I have already alluded, that there is a general feeling on the part of those engaged in making wine that an export board should be set up. But, merely on that account, the Government does not intend to depart from its practice of causing a ballot to be taken to settle the question, and when it is held the opportunity will be availed of to elect representatives to the board. </para>

              <para>- The representatives of tlie five co-operative companies engaged hi making wine and distilling spirit will take part in it, and the growers will have representation through those companies. It must be realized, of course, that this board is one to control the marketing of wine, and it is a body in which the wine-maker will be primarily interested. Undoubtedly the grapegrower also is interested - indirectly interested- but I think that it will be admitted by everybody that it would be quite impossible to conduct a ballot by which the growers in an industry who might number several&#39; thousands would determine the marketing methods of manufacturers, who number only hundreds. We must leave the settlement of that matter to the wine-maker, whose business it is to dispose of the wine. There is no doubt that the question, should a board be established, will be answered in the affirmative. The election of the members of the board will be provided for by regulation, it not being desirable to include a lot of unnecessary material in the bill. But it is proposed that each wine-maker and each distillery should have one vote, and the small wine-maker shall have just as much voice as the manufacturer in a large way in determining whether or not the board shall be appointed and in deciding its personnel. Arguments have been put forward by a section of the industry in favour of the number of votes permitted at the ballot to be in proportion with the quantity of wine produced, the large producers to have greater voting power than the small manufacturers. That could result - although I do not say that* it would - in a comparatively small number of large wine-makers, whose sales are almost entirely made on the local market, and who are perhaps not so keenly interested in the export trade as the smaller man- </para>

              <para>- That is so. It would make it possible for a comparatively small number to outvote the large number who are keenly interested in the export trade. The Government has decided, therefore, to give to each winery or distillery one vote for both the settlement of the major question whether a board is to be set up, and the election of representatives to the board. It is proposed that there shall be four representatives of the proprietary and privately-owned wineries or distilleries and two representatives of the cooperative enterprises. The production of the proprietary and co-operative concerns is roughly, on the basis of two-thirds and one-third respectively, so that the representation on the board will, as nearly as possible, conform to the ratio of production. It is proposed that the proprietary concerns shall have two representatives for South Australia and Western Australia - the latter State being  bracketted  with South Australia for that purpose - one for Victoria, and one for New South Wales and Queensland. I may say that there are five co-operative companies operating. The whole of the shareholders are growers, and the profits are divided among those growers. There are over 1,000 grower-shareholders in these five companies that are engaged in making wine and spirit. In addition to the six members of the board representing the wineries and distilleries, there will be a nominee of the Commonwealth Government. Honorable members will realize that it is necessary, when such a board is clothed with statutory powers, that the Commonwealth Government should have its own nominee upon it. </para>

              <para>- I shall deal with the point raised by the honorable member in due course. It has become almost an established practice for the Commonwealth to nominate as its representative on a board of this description, a gentleman who, while possessing first class commercial experience, is not in any way connected with the industry concerned. For example, the Commonwealth Government&#39;s representative on the Dried Fruits Export Control Board is engaged in the flour milling industry; on the Canned Fruits Export Control Board, he is engaged in the wool industry; and on the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, he is in a stock and station agency business. It will be seen that the Commonwealth Government has adopted the practice of selecting as its representatives on these boards, gentlemen who are in no way directly interested with the particular industries concerned, and that practice will be continued. </para>

          <para>The board to be established will meet from time to time to deal with the subject of the overseas marketing policy of the industry. It will meet at whatever place, is selected by the board. I suppose that most of the meetings of the wine board will take place in Adelaide, since South Australia is the State with the greatest production of wine. The gentlemen composing the board will be paid for their services by means of fees for sittings and travelling expenses. It is proposed to fix these by regulation in the same way as has been done in the three export control acts that have been passed already. </para>

          <para>Mi-. PATERSON.- A means is provided by which regulations can be disallowed. It is proposed that there shall be a London agency of the board, which shall consist of such members as the board may determine. There already exist in London agencies for the Dairy Produce Export Board and the Dried Fruits Export Board, the  chairman  and the Commonwealth nominee of which is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Cooper. That gentleman is also acting on&#39; behalf of the Canned Fruits Export Board, which has not yet decided to appoint a London agency.  Some idea of the possibilities of the expansion of our export wine trade in Great Britain may be gleaned from available figures, which indicate that Great Britain imports annually some 18,000,000 gallons of wine, 2,250,000 of which are supplied by Australia. This country has the advantage of a preferential duty, under which, by organized marketing, we should be able to secure a very much larger share of Great Britain&#39;s trade. The bill particularly lends itself for discussion at the committee stage, but I wish to deal very broadly with the statutory powers which it is proposed shall be vested by Parliament in the board. The principal power conferred by the bill is the granting of export licences, and that is dealt with in clause 14. The chief advantage of these export licences, which are recommended by the board, is that regulations will be framed governing the export of wine, which will enable the board to secure respect for the general marketing policy which it lays down. The export licence system is entirely beyond the experimental stage, as there are three of these boards now operating, two of them since the latter part of 1924, and the system has proved perfectly satisfactory. It works quite smoothly and, to a very great extent, continues to utilize the ordinary channels of trade. What I might describe as the second power in importance is that the board itself may act as an agent, and do everything required with regard to the marketing of wine placed under its complete control. I wish to make it clear that, while the board has power to recommend conditions to be embodied in export licences for the whole of the wine exported, it also has a specific power to act as agent and do everything required in marketing to advantage the wine which is voluntarily placed in its hands by those engaged in the industry. Clause 20 provides that the board may arrange finance; that recourse may be had, through the instrumentality of the board, to the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

              <para>- No, but that is a very important object. A man may export in the ordinary way, and through the ordinary trade channels, subject to licence, and yet find himself unable to obtain an advance from the Rural Credit Department of the Commonwealth Bank. But if that man decides to place his wine in the hands of the board for the purpose of obtaining an advance, his opportunities for obtaining accommodation are widened, as the board, being an incorporated body, can facilitate his arrangements with the Rural Credits Department. </para>

          <para>The board is also given authority to negotiate with shipping companies with regard to ocean freights on an industry basis. It can make contracts on a big scale for the carriage of wine which will be of advantage to the whole industry. It is already fairly generally known that very substantial freight reductions have been gained by our dairying and dried fruits industries through the wise use made of a similar power which is vested in their boards. The board will have power to require information to be furnished relating to the wine industry, such as particulars of quantities produced, exported, and so on, as may be necessary. Further, the board will have power to utilize funds for advertising in overseas markets. At present the Dried Fruits Board spends more than half of its revenues advertising its products overseas. The Commonwealth Government has adopted the policy of assisting any exporting industry which displays sufficient enterprise to spend sums of money in advertising its Australian product overseas, by supplementing that expenditure on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis, up to a limit of &#163;50,000. That policy has been of very great assistance to our exporting industries, and has enabled them, so to speak, to make double use of the money which they provide from their own funds for this purpose. </para>
          <para>It will be noticed that the bill relates to both dry and sweet wines. There are some of those engaged in the industry who desired that dry wines should be excluded from the measure. I do not see any sound reason for their exclusion. The Dairy Produce Export Board deals with both butter and cheese, while the Dried Fruits Export Board deals with sultanas, currants and lexias, and, although I admit that I speak without an intimate knowledge of the matter, there seems to me to be a sufficiently strong family resemblance between dry and sweet wines to warrant the inclusion of both. </para>

              <para>- The Commonwealth can provide, as a condition of the payment of the bounty, that a certain price must be paid for the grapes used to obtain it. The point that I desired to make was that if dry wine were excluded from the measure, a levy  would be imposed on the wine-makers in respect of their tonnage processed for both dry and sweet wine-making purposes, but the board would be able to use the revenue obtained for advertising sweet wines only. That would be an anomalous position, and, in order to make the position an equitable one, dry wines have been included in the measure. Quite apart from the advertising aspect, I can see no sound reason why dry wine should not be included, because if organized marketing is of advantage in disposing of our sweet wines, there is no reason why a similar state of affairs cannot apply to our dry wines. If the suggestion is put forward that our trade in dry wines is proceeding quite satisfactorily, and that that section of the industry is not faced with the difficulties which confront the marketing of our sweet wines, I merely answer that surely a board which is elected by and composed almost entirely of winemakers may be trusted to see that no unnecessary interference with the dry wine trade takes place. </para>

          <para>There are a good many points of detail which can best be discussed in committee. An endeavour has been made to meet the desires of the majority of those engaged in the wine industry and to be fair to all in the matter of representation. This is a non-party measure and, in view of the position of the industry and the obstacles which, until this export board comes into existence, will continue to exist, in the way of obtaining adequate finance to deal with the present season&#39;s vintage, I hope the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

          <para>.- I consider that the title of the bill does not correctly set forth its purpose, and that some very radical alteration should be made in it. I am glad to have the opportunity to place before honorable members the knowledge that I possess of the manner in which this legislation operates in one of the chief seaports of the Commonwealth, and to point out its adverse effect on our maritime industrial conditions. The bill would be more rightly entitled, &#34; A Special Licence to Ship-owners Bill,&#34; because it seeks to confirm them in the possession of a power which has already been exercised by them in a manner coercive, provocative, and irritating to the waterside workers. Furthermore, it affords them an opportunity to give certain people preference in employment, to the serious injury of many good, straightforward and honest citizens, who, in the past, have done theirwork faithfully and well to the advantage of the ship-owners and the community in general. In these circumstances, I cannot permit this legislation to pass without the most spirited of protests. I feel that the Government is not giving to this aspect of the question the consideration it deserves. If the ship-owners are given freedom to discriminate in regard to the labour they employ, it will not be conducive to the best interests of the people of Australia. &#39; Port Adelaide and Melbourne are the ports that have suffered most by the application of the regulations issued under the Transport Workers Act passed last session, and, in this regard, I am expressing the views of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mathews)</inline> as well as my own and those of my constituents. Negotiations I have carried on with the AttorneyGeneral have shown to me that shipowners are not prepared to play fair - that they are not even prepared to display a reasonable spirit in applying the existing regulations, and that they take advantage of the protection and sympathetic consideration extended to them by the Commonwealth Government to impose on the legitimate working class organizations and their membership. </para>

            <para>- Exactly, and I am endeavouring to show that the title of the bill does not correctly set forth the purpose for which it has been introduced. It is not a transport workers bill. I am endeavouring to show from my own knowledge that it is nothing but a bill to give a special licence, privilege and protection to the ship-owners. It certainly does not refer to the position of the transport workers as was intended by the AttorneyGeneral. </para>

            <para>- I think the title given is quite foreign to the provisions of the bill, and these in effect embrace regulations dealing with the working conditions along the waterfront. How can I discuss the title of the bill if I am not allowed to make some passing reference to the conditions which are operating on the  water front to-day? They have a direct relation to it. &#34;We do not want this legislation to impose on those engaged in labour the tyranny which is exercised over members of Parliament in regard to the restrictions imposed on debates. </para>

            <para>- On a point of order, I take it that the honorable member for Hindmarsh,, in endeavouring to show that the workers provided for under the licensing system have not proved to be the best, is perfectly within the Standing Orders. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bayley,</inline> had only allowed him to finish a sentence, he would have been able to show what poor work the licensed workers are doing at Port Adelaide. Surely he should be permitted to do that in discussing the title of the bill, which embraces the word &#34;workers.&#34; It is beyond my comprehension how you came to rule him out of order. </para>

            <para>- I have no desire to make a second-reading speech at this stage, but I think the bill might be more correctly styled &#34; The Transport Workers Extermination Act,&#34; or &#34;An act to provide special licences and privileges for ship-owners &#34; or &#34; An act to suppress the lawful ambition of working-class organizations engaged in the maritime industry. &#34; </para>

            <para>- The short title and the contents of- the bill are distinctly at variance. This measure might be more aptly described as a bill for &#34; an Act to conscript maritime labour.&#34; It discriminates unfairly between honest citizens and some nondescripts to whom protection is given by the licensing provisions in the later clauses. </para>

          <para>.- I suggest that the consideration of this clause should be postponed until the other provisions of the bill have been dealt with. By the time those other provisions have been considered, honorable- members may think that the title should be altered. The trouble that has arisen this evening arises out of the fact that only about 25 per cent, of the members of this  chamber  had an opportunity to address themselves to the motion for the second reading of the bill. The Prime Minister, by summarily closing the debate, deprived 75 per cent, of the members of an opportunity to discuss the bill with the latitude that is allowed at the second reading stage. That is a good and sufficient reason for the postponement of the clause. Another is that this title may be found to be decidedly misleading. Indeed, I am sure it is, in view of the indications of Government policy given by Ministers when speaking on the motion for the second reading. After consideration of the later provisions, honorable members may decide to postpone indefinitely the operation of the bill on the ground that it is calculated to promote discord instead of tranquillity in industry. The honorable member for Hindmarsh said that the measure might be cited as an act to conscript labour. I think it might be called &#34; an act to promote industrial strife,&#34; or &#34; an act to provoke contempt of the law and those administering it,&#34; or &#34; an act to foment industrial unrest for political purposes.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- As a new member, I may find it difficult to describe the enormity of this bill and its reactionary tendencies within the limits prescribed by you, sir, but I hope that allowance will be made for my parliamentary inexperience. As the Government is noted for appointing boards, commissions and committees, I .suggest that a select committee of four might be appointed from the ministerial parties to invite the transport workers to give a title to the bill. I am sure they would name it readily and aptly, but perhaps not in parliamentary language. The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marks)</inline> said that a great deal of unnecessary suspicion was created in the minds of industrialists, particularly the transport workers, by inflammatory and provocative speeches by Labour leaders. My reply to that is that the Transport Workers Act is anathema to all right-thinking men and women, and has created more suspicion in the minds of the workers than anything else within my knowledge. That being so it is clear that the title of the bill is objectionable to the largest section in the community; and furthermore, that this Government is not sincere in its profession that it desires to bring about peace in industry. How can it ensure peace if it introduces provocative legislation like this? </para>

            <para>- Time will convince the Government that this measure will not do what it purports to do. It will be used to protect certain unskilled persons to secure employment in an industry where they may be a menace not only to themselves, but to others engaged in it. This happened during the industrial upheaval in 1917. The bill in all its aspects is derogatory to the workers of Australia, and as one who has lately been employed in industry, I feel it incumbent upon me to raise my voice in protest against it. I represent a very large number of workers in various branches of the transport industry, and I say without hesitation that there is a feeling in the minds of the people that the Government is not sincere in its efforts to secure peace in industry. </para>

        <para class="block">This is not a bill dealing with the regulation of an essential industry, nor is it designed to ensure the continuity of all services requisite for the carrying on of transportation by sea. It is concerned with only one class of persons employed in that essential service, and therefore the title clearly indicates the discriminatory character of the bill. It deals, not with the workers generally, but with only those workers engaged in the business of transport. Later, the restrictive  terms  employed in the definition of the term &#34;Transport Workers&#34; suggest that there should be some qualification even in the title, because as ordinarily understood, the term &#34; transport workers &#34; would include a number of persons other than those employed merely in transport services by sea. The title indicates, and the other provisions of the bill clearly demonstrate, that the measure deals exclusively with transport workers who must &#39;be registered and licensed before securing employment in the industry. It does not propose to deal with transport employers. A stevedoring company, for example, is an integral part of this essential service, but it will not be brought within the scope of the bill. No regulations, restrictions, or obligations to apply for licences to employ labour will be imposed upon employers. Having regard to the provisions of the bill, it is appropriate that the word &#34; workers &#34; should be included in the short title, to emphasize the particularly restrictive character of the measure and to bring into bold relief the class consciousness  of tlie Government in introducing this legislation. Therefore, unlike my honorable friends on this side, I congratulate the Minister in charge of the measure on the correct designation in the title of the bill. I also congratulate the Government on having had the courage to make it plain to the people generally that the bill deals only with transport workers, and will not be applied to other persons, including employers, who are as essential as workers to the conduct of transport by sea. Obviously the Government&#39;s intention is to impose restrictions and regulations upon the workers and to give the employers an &#34; open go.&#34; I repeat, therefore, that the short title is a correct designation for the bill. </para>

            <para>- Well, I -will say that the postponement of the operation of the act will give the people time to understand the class of legislation that is being &#34;belted&#34; through Parliament by the unfair tactics of the Prime Minister during the second-reading debate. This class-conscious legislation proposes to deal with only one section of the people - the transport workers. At present the people are not fully alive to what is being done in this House. They have no opportunity to know, because legislation is being rushed through. This, I submit, is a very sound reason why the act should not commence until the date fixed in my amendment. The people should know more about the provisions of the bill, and the pernicious effect it will have upon industry generally. _ , </para>

            <para>- I purposely fixed upon a date prior to the next general election, so that honorable members on this side would be able to go before the people and expose the act in all its nakedness. Only to-day it was necessary for an honorable member on this side of the House, speaking as the representative of a large number of workers, to urge the Government to realize its obligation in regard to a matter affecting all the people of Australia. Had there been a division on the honorable member&#39;s motion we should have had an opportunity to see where all parties stand. </para>

            <para>- I wish to give my reasons why the commencement of the act should be postponed, and to do this I desire to place in true perspective the position of a large section of our primary producers - I refer to the miners in every grade. . Ever since this Government has been in power we have heard over and over again that the economic position of Australia is unsound ; that wages are too high, and that costs must come down. Accordingly the policy of this Government has been to introduce vicious measures containing penal provisions curtailing the privileges of the workers. We all know what has happened in connexion with the Arbitration Court. Honorable members are now being asked to agree to a measure which will bludgeon the workers into submission. </para>

            <para>- Then I shall substitute for it the word &#34;sandbag.&#34; This is one reason why I am moving an amendment to postpone the operation of the act. In the last Parliament a similar bill was rushed through this committee in the same way that this measure is now being dealt with. Were I permitted to say so, I should put it that the Prime Minister is acting with brutal ferocity, but as I know that term would not be permitted, I shall say instead that he is again attempting to govern Australia on the castor oil  principle. If this legislation is placed on the statute-book, the transport workers of Australia will be reduced to the level of convicts, and forced to carry dog discs. </para>

            <para>- I am advancing reasons why the date of the proclamation of the act should be postponed. That date should be fixed, not by proclamation, but by Parliament. Legislation of this land is a direct attack on that section of the electors which is represented by honorable members on this side. Instead, of the bill being &#34; gagged &#34; through this chamber, the freest discussion of its provisions should be allowed in the interests of the workers of this country. If the date of the commencement of the act is not extended, thousands of workers throughout Australia will have to apply for licences to work. The clock in this chamber stopped this afternoon. If it were animate I should feel disposed to think that it had stopped after having contemplated the bill now before us. Legislation of this kind puts back the clock of progress 50, 60 or 70 years. In order that the persons who will be most affected by this legislation may have an opportunity of understanding it, the date on which it is to come into operation should be carried forward. Otherwise thousands of workers throughout the country will be dragooned into accepting a standard of living which they thought belonged to the past. This-bill is one of the most  brutal  pieces of legislation ever introduced into a British Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I am endeavouring to show what the effect of the bill will be in order to convince honorable members that it should not be brought into operation at an early date. Probably the proclamation has already been prepared for gazettal, but it should not be gazetted until 1931 at least, so that the electors may have an opportunity to express their views concerning it soon after it becomes operative. This bill is a direct attack upon the workers, who, after much tribulation, have at last obtained conditions which enable them to live in some measure of comfort. Unfortunately, the benefits of that memorable award made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins have to a great extent been whittled away. </para>

            <para>- By postponing the operation of this legislation until the date mentioned in my amendment, an opportunity will be given to remedy some of the evils for which the Government is responsible. Some of the recent happenings in Australia remind me of the time when I was taken from Le Havre to the fighting lines in a horse box. One half of the men now employed on the wharfs at Port Adelaide do not understand the English language. Many of them are dressed in chocolate coloured corduroy clothing, and one would expect them to be carrying banjos or mandolins, or accompanied by organs and monkeys, rather than by policemen. The Government and its supporters surely cannot be pleased with the results of the regulations under the Transport Workers Act, yet they now seek to incorporate those regulations in an act of Parliament. If only to allow every honorable member an opportunity to discuss this bill, the date of its coming into operation should be postponed. I am not an unreasonable  man, and, should the Prime Minister desire it, I am prepared to alter my amendment to provide that the act shall not come into operation for several hundred years. We have no right to impose such conditions on posterity. We have alienated the best of our land from posterity, thus robbing posterity of its birthright. Having robbed those who will follow us of the opportunity to make the world a garden, we should not now make it necessary for them to wear a crown of thorns. I urge those members who claim to represent the primary producers of this country not to forget the miners, the navvies, the shearers and the rouseabouts, who comprise two-thirds of those engaged in primary production. Honorable members opposite, who say that  Ave  on this side should not preach class consciousness, not only themselves preach class consciousness, but also endeavour to enact class legislation. </para>

            <para>- The bill is all embracing. That is one reason why it should not be put into operation too soon. Such legislation will tend towards  a  greater class consciousness in the community. I hope that honorable members opposite will not blindly follow the Prime Minister and his frail of castor oil. They should not try to force on men who, year in and year out, toil for their living, the indignity of wearing  a  dog collar and disc. I hope that the committee will agree to my amendment.&#39; </para>

          <para>.- This clause provides that the bill shall come into operation on a date to be fixed. We on this side hold the view - a view that is shared by many people throughout Australia - that this is one of the most obnoxious pieces of legislation ever introduced into a British Parliament, and therefore should never come into operation. That being so, I shall call for a division on the question that the clause be agreed to. I sympathize with the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> in his desire to delay as long as possible the coming intooperation of legislation of this kind, but the bill is so obnoxious that no postponement could be satisfactory. I propose to use all the forms of the legislature and all the powers we possess in an effort to prevent the bill from coming into force. We on this side shall deal with the several clauses as we think fit when they are before us ; but, on the question of the date of the . commencement of the act, there can be no compromise. We shall vote definitely against such legislation ever coming into operation; no postponement can satisfy us. </para>

          <para>.- I agree with the opinion expressed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> that whatever date might be  fixed  for this bill to become operative would be too early. I do not intend to support any date, however distant it may be, as I do not believe in the principle embodied in the bill. I can scarcely understand the audacity of the Government in introducing such a measure. I say most emphatically that at the last general election the people pronounced themselves against legislation of this character. That was shown by the Senate vote in three of the most populous States, where the Government supporters met with an overwhelming defeat. Where is the  ex-honorable  member for Macquarie. a strong advocate of the bill? Where are the honorable members who represented Barton, Herbert, Fremantle, Franklin, and Wakefield in the last Parliament? All have lost their seats  in  this House. Every honorable member opposite elected received a largely reduced majority. </para>

Notwithstanding the fact that the whole of the wealth as well as the press of Australia opposed the Labour party, we did not lose a single member, whereas the Nationalist party, which went to the country with a big majority, and had the assistance of a large number of sitting members, lost eight seats. All the evidence at our disposal shows that the country is emphatically opposed to legislation of this character. I represent a constituency where the only battle ever fought on Australian soil was waged, and on that occasion the question at issue was the granting of licences without which men were not to have the right to work.The miners at Eureka revolted against such an interference with their freedom, and the workers enjoyed some freedom until the Bruce-Page Government came into office.

        <para class="block">Workers Act was returned with a greatly reduced majority. During my association with the Victorian State Parliament the Irvine Coercion Act was placed upon the statute-book, but I remained a member of that Parliament sufficiently long to see that tyrannical legislation repealed. I have not the slightest doubt that when another appeal is made to the country this Government will be defeated, and this measure will be treated as other tyrannical legislation has been. I suppose it is useless arguing against the passage of the bill, because it is part and parcel of the Government&#39;s policy, and one which will assist in causing industrial trouble prior to the next election. Will the Prime Minister tell us when the next strike is likely to occur, and where the bombs will be manufactured for use before the next election. Perhaps he will also tell us if he is going to place upon trade unionists the blame for throwing bombs. These are, I suppose, tricks which he learned in America, where the Government when it is anticipating defeat arranges for bombs to be thrown and trade unionists to be blamed. </para>

            <para>- I join with other honorable members on this side of the chamber in strongly opposing this clause, and I trust the Government will not succeed in fixing a date on which the bill shall come into operation. I hope that honorable members will defeat this bill; which instead of bringing about industrial peace, will lead to further trouble. I can remember meeting many honorable members opposite on the public platform when, as so-called staunch loyalists, they were appealing for recruits to fight for Australia and the Empire. But the men whose assistance they were then seeking are those whom they now stigmatize as criminals. The unionists whom the Government wish to punish are only asking for a living wage to enable them to purchase the necessaries of life for themselves, their wives and children. The Prime Minister of Australia is the only Prime Minister in the British Dominions who has introduced legislation of this character. I am strongly opposed to the bill, and shall vote against the clause. </para>

          <para>.- I cannot support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> to make the 1st January, 1931, the date on which this clause shall come into operation, as I believe that no date should be stipulated. Frequent reference has been made to the necessity for peace in industry; but legislation of this character will make that desirable objective impossible. As one who may be termed a moderate Labour man, I regard the action of the Government, in introducing this measure, as ill-advised; it will only engender bitterness and cause widespread industrial unrest. I was in England during the great industrial upheaval caused by the general strike, but I cannot recall such drastic legislation as this being introduced into the British Parliament. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member for Warringah was also in Great Britain at the time, and if he had studied&#39; the industrial situation in that country, or the legislation introduced, he would not make such a statement. When in England I had the privilege of listening to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> deliver a number of excellent speeches, in which he told the people in England of the wonderful workers we had in Australia, and of the efforts that were being made to maintain here a high standard of living. But, in introducing legislation of this character the right honorable gentleman is defeating the object which, he said, the Australian Government had in view. I trust the clause, which I intend to oppose, will not have the support of the majority of the committee. </para>

          <para>. - If this clause read &#34; This act shall commence on a date never to be fixed,&#34; it would, I think, meet the views of honorable members on this side of the chamber. The honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> in a careful analysis of the preceding clause, showed clearly the class nature of the bill, and that it has been introduced on behalf of those whose interests the Government are advocating at the moment. The reason why no definite date is fixed may be that the Govern ment wishes to be able, as the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> said, to proclaim it at the psychological moment round about election time. The real reason why the date is not fixed, in my opinion, is that the Government desires to be in a position to comply with the wishes of its masters, which in this case are the ship-owners. </para>

            <para>- The people are but a secondary consideration with this Government. That has been proved conclusively, particularly upon this issue. No matter at what length honorable members on this side may address themselves to this subject, the Government will have its way in passing the bill, but while it may have its numbers in this Parliament it will not have the last voice on the matter. Thanks to the organization of Labour on the. industrial side, that great body is capable of using the power at its disposal to force the granting of what it considers justice in a country like Australia. While the Government may &#34; put over &#34; this clause, and &#34; get away with &#34; this bill, while it may arrange matters in such a manner as to proclaim the act at a time that suits its masters, the workers will never lose sight of the objectionable features of the measure. These will furnish them with a rallying cry and administer to them a lesson as to the value of cutting away from the craft system of unionism and getting down to an industrial basis by which their economic strength will be felt far more than it has been in the past. When that time comes, Labour will be able to treat the Government in the way that it deserves. </para>

          <para>.- I owe my presence in&#34; this chamber to my continuous opposition for five months to the industrial legislation of the present Government. My opponent at the election, in his opening address, said that he was prepared to stand or fall by the Crimes Act, the amended Arbitration Act, and the Transport Workers Act that had been passed by the Bruce-Page Government. And he fell. I intend to vote against this bill, lock, stock and barrel. I claim to know something of the industrial conditions of the waterside workers.  The </para>

        <para class="block">Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> was good enough to compliment me upon my secondreading speech on the bill, by saying that it was of a bitter and sceptical character. If it was bitter it was because I have bitter feelings towards this Government. I give Ministers and their supporters no credit for honesty of purpose so far as this legislation is concerned, and when the whole of the people get back to a commonsense view of it they will reject this Government, just as they have rejected every other Government that has attempted anything of the kind, so that it should be repealed. The bill, instead of being calculated to promote peace in industry, seethes with everything that makes for industrial strife. I have been trained in the school of adversity, and I have had bitter experiences in fighting against the principles espoused by honorable members opposite. Because I feel bitter against those things I am not prepared to trust honorable members behind the Government, when they say they are holding out the olive branch, with a view to bringing about industrial peace. I am pleased to know that the Leader of the Opposition intends to divide the committee on this clause, and I hope that as the bill proceeds through the committee stage, a number of divisions will be taken to show exactly where the people&#39;s representatives stand on this important issue. I stated in the course of my second-read- ing speech that there was reason to believe that the Government was receiving money under false pretences by requiring workmen to purchase licences to carry on their avocation. The Transport Workers Act has been appropriately referred to as the &#34; dog collar &#34; act. In Queensland, a charge of 2s. 6d. is made for the registration of a dog, so that dog licences are not as cheap as those issued to workmen under this act. If the Government insists on passing this offensive and provocative legislation, my prognostication of its downfall will be fulfilled, because it is not fit to have charge of the affairs of the Commonwealth. </para>

I agree with the- honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath)</inline> that a bill such as this is calculated to provoke another Eureka, but one on a more gigantic scale than that historic affair.

          <para>.- I had not imagined that  I should live to see a bill such as this brought into the Commonwealth Parliament. Every clause is unworthy of the Government, unworthy of this Parliament, and unworthy of Australia. I recall only one similar bill to that now under discussion. It was introduced in the Victorian Parliament by the present Chief Justice of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir William Irvine),</inline> who was then State Premier, and even the Legislative Council of that State ultimately rejected it unanimously. No member on either side would believe for a moment that any portion of this bill would be accepted by the people of Australia if they had the power of vetoing it. The people elect the Parliament once every three years, and the Government makes itself more powerful than the people. The party opposite says that it trusts the people; if so, I challenge honorable members opposite to refer this bill to the electors. I am sure that if the people had the power of veto they would not permit the clause under consideration, or any other clause of the bill, to pass into law. Some day the people will have that power, and when that time comes no tinpot dictators such as the present Government will attempt to bring in such a measure as this. From my many years&#39; experience of the people in the capital cities of the Commonwealth I am prepared to challenge the Prime Minister to obtain their agreement to this bill. I do not think that they would disgrace their manhood or womanhood by consenting to such infamous legislation. I stamp it as infamous, lock, stock, and barrel, and look upon it as unworthy of the Government, the Ministerial following, and the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>.- This measure, which has been brought down to deal with the protected industries of the Commonwealth is a quite inadequate contribution towards the solution of the problems which were outlined bythe Prime Minister in his policy speech at Dandenong. It will be remembered that on that occasion the right honorable gentleman contended that there were four great objectives towards which all our efforts should be directed, namely - </para>

          <para>Basicly those objectives involve the provision of adequate security for the industries of the country and, quite patently, in dealing with the fiscal situation, the consideration of that problem warranted that the Government should do  something more than was contained in the principal Tariff Board Act. The amendments which this bill proposes to make to the principal act will produce no fundamental change in the board&#39;s functions or in the efficiency with which it will perform its work. When all is said and done, this measure merely alters the remuneration of the members of the Tariff Board, and affords the board a. certain amount of relief from what I may describe as the perfunctory investigations with which it was previously charged. And even in that respect the relief is more apparent than real, because all that the bill proposes to do is to enable the Minister to exercise his own discretion in certain inquiries where previously . it was mandatory upon him to refer such matters to the board. Hitherto, when the board engaged in these inquiries, very little time was occupied in their determination, unless they were the subject of dispute. It is certain that, in future, should there be a dispute concerning a matter which is before the &#34;Minister, he will, in order to relieve himself of the obligation of making a decision which is bound to offend somebody, exercise the right that he retains under the amending bill and charge the board with the responsibility of making the inquiry. The statistics set out in the report of the Tariff Board indicate that of 824 reports submitted by it to the Minister in the last fiscal year, no fewer than 717 related to request for the admission of goods under by-laws. It is proposed in this bill that such requests shall be referred to the Tariff Board, whenever the Minister desires so to do. Except in particularly difficult cases, these requests have not previously occupied the attention of the board to any great extent, and it will be found that the situation will not be altered much in the future. It is almost certain that the Minister himself will not decide intricate points when he has, conveniently at his elbow, an authority upon whose shoulders he can lean. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and which will relieve him of the  risks  which are inseparable from any exercise of discretion on his part. The rest of the work which the board performed in the last fiscal year will still be allotted to it. The amending bill does not suggest to me that the board will be any more efficiently composed to &#39; deal with these matters in the future than has been the case in the past. It is true that power is taken to enable the board to sit, as it were, in two sections, as two members of the board may conduct an inquiry in one quarter and the other two in another. But neither of those sectional boards can make a report to the Minister until the matter has been brought before the full board. So that, instead of being a contribution towards the efficiency of the board, that provision merely sets up an additional method of circumlocution. Obviously, if a matter is of no very great moment the  chairman  will not occupy himself very long over it, but if it is important it is certain that the members of the board who did not participate in the original inquiry will not accept the decision of their colleagues without further investigation as they, equally with those who made the first examination, are charged with the responsibility of the final decision. </para>

          <para>There are other considerations attached to the decisions of the board itself that seem to me to need attention. I consider that it is entirely wrong that the members of the board should be paid a sitting fee instead of an annual salary. I presume that the reason why the Minister said that it had been found difficult to obtain men of the type that he considered best suited to serve on the board if an annual salary were paid, was that the persons whom he had in mind were already engaged, in an executive capacity, in important commercial and industrial undertakings. The Tariff Board is a semi-judicial body, charged with the responsibility of impartially reviewing matters that profoundly concern the commercial interests of important sections of this community. I consider that it is net right that men who have important business affiliations, with which they continue to remain associated, should be given positions of a semi-judicial character and empowered to make findings that may affect the profits and losses of firms actually in competition with the business interests with which they are personally concerned. Furthermore, it occurs to me to be an entirely vicious principle that men who have no definite and binding responsibility to the Commonwealth as a nation should temporarily have thrust upon them the responsibility of making important investigations and findings which profoundly effect the interests of certain traders. We are perfectly safe in dealing with this matter impersonally, because the proposed appointees to the Tariff Board are not at present within our cognizance. We do not know who they are likely to be, and I am quite unconcerned whether they are Brown or Jones or Robinson. But if Brown, the director or manager of, say, a large metal  firm  is appointed, and as a member of the board is charged with the responsibility of investigating one or other of the matters which under this bill may be submitted to the board for investigation, the possibility is that the subject of the investigation may relate specifically to the particular interests of the corporation with which he is associated. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that it has. Is it defensible that men who are engaged in important investigations and charged with the duty of making a recommendation to the Minister for Trade and Customs should have, either at the time or in prospect, an indirect interest, unconscious though it may be, in the ultimate consequences of their finding or recommendation. It is very properly provided that the  chairman  of the board shall be an officer of the Customs Department, but the board is to consist of four members, and surely if it is desirable, as undoubtedly it is, for the  chairman  to be responsible solely to this community, it is equally desirable that his colleagues, who may outvote him in respect to any recommendation submited  to the Minister, should be no less responsible to the community. They should not be able to wash their hands of their Commonwealth obligations and continue to engage in private business which may unconsciously, or consciously for all we know, profoundly influence their findings. The subjects which may be referred to the board for inquiry go to the very roots of the economic life of the nation. They embrace every important industry. They relate to the raw materials of many of our essential industries and to the development in every respect of our secondary industries. Manufacturing in all its aspects, with all its varied interests and competitions, is the particular subject of the researches of the board. If it is to be worth its salt, the board&#39;s pronouncements must materially influence the ultimate decisions of the Minister. If the Minister will not as a general practice carry out the findings of the board, there is the strongest reason for at once terminating the existence of the board. The decisions of the Tariff Board must either be a paramount factor in determining the decisions of the Minister, or the board is a costly extravagance which the country in its present position cannot afford. As I have already said, it is of the utmost importance that its members should be entirely free from any association, direct or indirect, with the interests of private traders. They should not lay themselves open to the suspicion, justly or unjustly founded, that they are concerned in the welfare of any trader or group of traders. In some respects, the board functions after the style of the Arbitration Court; and the very first essential in respect to the acceptance of its decisions is that its members, like those who preside over the Arbitration Court, should be free not only from any possibility of partisanship, but also from the suspicion, that in coming to their decisions they have been influenced by considerations other than the weight of evidence. Individuals associated with the fortunes of any particular trading corporation, therefore, ought not to be chosen as members of the Tariff Board. The payment of fees, for which provision is made in this bill, postulates that a member of the board who is not the  chairman,  will be quite free to continue his participation in a particular business. There is nothing in the act or in the bill to disqualify for membership a director or manager of a company who is already being paid handsomely for safeguarding the interests of a group of shareholders. It is entirely wrong that a person discharging the semijudicial duties of a member of the Tariff Board should at the same time be in the receipt of emoluments for services rendered to any particular trading firm or group of firms. When, therefore, we come to the clause in committee, 1 trust the Minister will recognize that there are others than those engaged in the sordid street commerce who are quite competent to give adequate service to the Commonwealth, as members of the Tariff Board. I trust that he will abandon his contention that it is impossible to secure good men who will give their whole and unfettered service to the work of the board. 1 should be quite content if the board consisted of an officer of the Customs Department, an officer of the Statistician&#39;s Department, and some responsible person associated with the proposed Bureau of Economic Research, to which reference is made in this bill. A board such as this should make its investigations quite independently of any particular business interests. The work of the Tariff Board is primarily one of investigation - the final responsibility rests with the Minister for Trade and Customs- and- the men. who make the investigations should be definitely and solely responsible to the Commonwealth. Men partially responsible to the Commonwealth and partly to a particular corporation should not, in my judgment, be entrusted with important investigations, because inevitably - already the suggestion has been made - it will be said that the inquiries are not conducted as they should be. </para>

          <para>The memorandum furnished to honorable members indicates that when a Director of Economic Research has been appointed, the Minister may direct the board to confer with him upon any particular matter referred to it for inquiry. I ask the Minister to let honorable members know if the consultation is to take place in public, the Director being sworn as a witness in the usual way, or whether he is to have a sort of confidential conference with the board, at which he will impart the conclusions he has formed. It is important that we should know the precise relationship between the two bodies. Economic research is not an exact science. Nor is it completely a statistical science. Much of the ground that the Bureau of Economic Research will traverse will be, in many respects, speculative. A good deal df its work will consist in the examination of opinions, theories and deductions, and confidential conferences between the </para>
          <para class="block">Director of the Bureau and the members of the Tariff Board would probably induce the latter to accept as facts matters highly contentious in their nature and most certainly unproved, which later on might be completely overthrown in the light of established knowledge. The word &#34;Research &#34; suggests the possibility of this. I wish to rescue the proposal of the Government for a Bureau of Economic Research from the misuse to which this bill intends it to be put. The bureau must be regarded - solely as a body engaged in investigation and as one whose conclusions will be very doubtful. For the most part they will be contributions to thought rather than to knowledge, that is to say, the work of the bureau will lie in the examination and consideration of various hypothesis, rather than in laying down established conclusions in regard to any particular subject. It will, therefore, be entirely wrong if the Tariff Board, which has to deal with the particular interests of particular traders is exposed to the influence of a bureau of this description, without the representations that the bureau may make being  challengable.  by those whom they concern. I hope that in committee the Minister will make it plain that the Director of Economic Research will go before the board as an ordinary witness, and be required to justify his evidence, and submit to cross-examination. Unless that is done, the board will be put in a false position, and the Bureau of Economic Research will be brought into mischievous relationship to certain aspects of our national and industrial life. The bill provides that upon receiving a direction from the Minister, the board must confer with the Director of Economic Research. </para>

              <para>- What is the difference between a recommendation and a finding? Presumably the board bases its findings on the weight of evidence.

          <para>What I said earlier regarding the desirability of the members of the board being placed above the suspicion of being influenced by special interests, applies particularly to the relations of that body with the Minister. He has the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the recommendations made to him, and the fact that certain members of the board have retained their commercial associations and continue as managers and directors of private enterprises may be the reason why the board has arrived at findings which the Minister has considered wrong. In future the board should be differently constituted. There should be no suspicion as to the propriety and impartiality of the board&#39;s decisions, and then the Minister would merely have to decide whether effect should be given to them as matters of policy. I recognize that some things which cannot be justi fied by ordinary commercial standards are, nevertheless, desirable in the national interest. The board might make certain recommendations, which the Minister, taking a broader and longer view of the necessities of the future, would not be prepared to recommend to Parliament. I can appreciate that a government concerned with the problem of national development must look to the ultimate as well as to the immediate, but I cannot understand why a body to which is entrusted semi-judicial functions, should be partly composed of men liable to be influenced by private commercial interests. What would happen if the Director of Economic Research were paid only sitting fees, but were permitted to hold managerial and directorial posts with private organizations? Could we reasonably be asked to accept his findings and recommendations as true and impartial expositions of economics? When the bill is in committee I hope that the two provisions which I consider fundamentally unsound will be removed, so that, firstly, it will not be possible for the Director of Economic Research to influence the decisions of the board in private conferences, at which his evidence will not be challengeable by those directly concerned, and, secondly, the members of the board will have no association with particular firms or private interests. </para>

              <para>- I can only say that if the question of salary stands in the way of .getting the right man, then the obvious thing to do is to offer a higher salary so as to attract the right type of man. This is the course which we follow with regard to many other important appointments. We say that a person in the Commonwealth employ should be in receipt of a salary high enough to render unnecessary his engaging in outside employment to supplement his income. Actually public servants are prohibited from engaging in outside work. The  chairman  of the board is not allowed to accept outside employment. If he is expected to give the whole of his time to Tariff Board matters - I agree that it is proper that he should do that - it certainly is equally important that his colleagues also should give the whole of their time to the board&#39;s business, because the board functions as a whole. The suggestion that the board should be divided into two sections for the purpose of certain inquiries will not work well in practice, because all recommendations must be made by the full board. If certain members are to be free in the daytime to engage in private work, the  chairman,  in respect of some matters, will be working without the active and full collaboration of his colleagues. They may be occupied with their ordinary private business engagements and when they meet as a board, the  chairman  will have to inform them of the stage of his investigations. </para>

          <para>There is not much more that I need say about the bill. As the fulfilment of the ideas mentioned in the Prime Minister&#39;s, policy speech, I regard the bill as a feeble instrument for the realization of a great objective. It does not alter in any material degree the procedure or the character of the board and it will not contribute very much towards the satisfactory solution of tariff problems that have arisen in the last three or four years. For this reason I consider that it is anything but a satisfactory discharge of the high expectations which the Prime Minister led the country to believe would follow the passage of the bill. </para>

            <para>.- I am in complete agreement with much of what the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> has said, but I differ from him in regard to one or two points. All honorable members concur in his statement that members of the board should be absolutely free from any suspicion or taint of commercial interest, which might affect their judgment when dealing with important tariff problems. We have had in the history of the board a lamentable instance to the contrary. In one of its reports, the board thought it necessary to point out that one of its members had an indirect personal interest in a certain matter that had come before it for decision, and evidently conscious of the reflection which this might cast upon their work, the members of the board proceeded rather elaborately to justify what had been done. I drew particular attention to this incident in one of the tariff debates, and I regret to say that at the time it did not seem to shock the conscience of honorable members to any appreciable extent. I am, however, glad to hear a chorus of approval at the enunciation of the principle that this should not occur again. I should like to carry the idea a little further. I should like members of the board to be not only free from suspicion of commercial  interest, but free also from any suspicion of political pressure. I am well aware that the majority of honorable members, being strongly protectionist in their beliefs, are not disposed to find serious fault with the methods adopted by the board in the past; but I feel sure that if any fair-minded person reads the board&#39;s reports and studies its work, he will be bound to confess that the work of the board has not been quite satisfactory. The object of its appointment was to lift all tariff matters out of the arena of personal or sectional interests which would be fought out on the floor of this House. It was intended that the board, in making its recommendations, should be free from the pressure of any political class; that it should weigh the claims of individuals against the interests of the community. </para>

              <para>- Nevertheless I make it. It is strange that whenever a member attempts to point out the deficiencies of a system he is accused of making improper statements against persons. I shallnot be silenced by such remarks. The board has not been satisfactory. For a long time its inquiries were held in secret. Only as a result of action taken in this House were its inquiries thrown open and evidence taken on oath. That that reform was necessary shows that matters were not right previously. </para>

              <para>- Honorable members have only to read the reports of the board to convince themselves of the truth of my statement. I wonder how many honorable members who profess a desire to see the board&#39;s reports, take the trouble to study them carefully. I have done so, and have on many occasions quoted from them to show that in some cases the board&#39;s recommendations have been against the weight of evidence. So long as a board considers that its duty is to carry out the policy of the Minister and the Government, it cannot be unbiased. That has been the trouble with the Tariff Board in the past, and for that reason 1 differ from the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who says that he is perfectly satisfied that its  chairman  should be an officer of the Customs Department. In saying that I make no reflection on any departmental officer. It is the duty of the officers of a department to carry out the instructions given to them by the Minister. </para>

              <para>- &#34; By their fruits ye shall know them. &#34; Reference has been made to the need for co-operation between the Tariff Board and the Bureau of Economic Research. When the Tariff Board was established it was expected that it would take economic facts into consideration. The honorable member for Fremantle would have us believe that all economic research is uncertain and indefinite, but I point out that while in almost all departments of knowledge, we are as yet in the developmental stages, there is a great deal of exact knowledge to be obtained by a proper use of economic research. That the Tariff Board has riot seen fit to undertake economic research is one of the reasons why it has perpetrated so many absurdities. So far from showing a desire to take advantage of any economic facts at its disposal, there is at least one instance on record in which the  chairman  of the board objected to evidence being given before the board, by one of the ablest economists in Australia. That he was a free trader was .probably the reason for the objection to his evidence being heard. Although the honorable member for Fremantle does not appear to be a rabid protectionist, he seems to fear that by bringing economic research to bear on tariff matters some of the fallacies of the protectionist system might be exposed. Many protectionists are afraid of economics; they prefer to belittle the advantages of research rather than face economic facts. The board should take economic principles into account all the time. Instead of conferring with the Director of Economic Research from time to time merely at the whim of the Minister, economic truths should be taken into account all the time. Indeed the members of the board should themselves be trained in economics and be capable of weighing economic facts. I agree that in the event of the Director of Economic Research being brought be fore the board he should give evidence on oath and be subject to cross-examination. I do not believe in private conferences between - him and the Tariff Board. </para>

              <para>- The board should not only be empowered to obtain evidence from any source, but it should also be capable of weighing that evidence when it is given. In our law courts it is not unusual to have the evidence of say, six medical men on behalf of a plaintiff and the evidence of a similar number of medical men to the opposite effect. Without this, a judge, not possessing the necessary medical knowledge, would be unable to determine the value of the evidence tendered. The members of the board should have the necessary qualifications, including, if possible, a knowledge of economics, to enable them to crossexamine witnesses and critically analyse the evidence given before the board. I have known cases where professional men were biased in favour of the interests they represented; but if entirely independent they would be able to sift evidence and come to a correct decision. Much depends upon the complete independence of the members of the board. They should be independent of monetary interests and of political prejudice. </para>

          <para>I wish now to mention one matter, discussed at some considerable length by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> who recommended that Parliament ought to determine the amount of protection, and that the board should only be able, within the limitations laid down by Parliament, to state what protection should be afforded. That is quite wrong, and, in my opinion, is begging the question. If a principle is to be employed in giving effect to a protective policy, we should try to assess duties in such a way that the conditions of internal manufacture will be subject to exactly the same disadvantages as the imported articles, or vice versa. We should try to equalize the conditions between the two. That is, I think, a fair way of expressing the principle, and that cannot be done before an inquiry has been conducted. The whole inquiry should be based upon facts, such as Parliament cannot have at its disposal. To arbitrarily determine certain limitations, under which the board shall operate would be to annul the whole benefits and objects of the board. . </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Dalley also dealt extensively with the subject of dumping. The word &#34;dumping&#34; has been frequently used, is very often wrongly employed, and is also used as an excuse for additional protection, ft is said . on general principles thai if any article manufactured in England is sold in Australia at less than the home consumption pride, that is an act of dumping. I have searched the Tariff Board&#39;s reports, of which I have read many, and have not found a reference to a common commercial fact which has a direct bearing on the subject of dumping. In England the manufacturers for the home market in many cases work under conditions which differ from those manufacturing for export. Articles manufactured for home consumption are subject to duties and rates, whilst those manufactured for export have their duties remitted under drawback. Obviously, that is done to encourage the manufacturer in England, and to develop an export trade. That is&#39; what we ought to be doing in Australia. To describe manufacturing and selling under - such circumstances as dumping is manifestly unfair, as all the conditions are not taken into account. Usually it is only the difference in prices which are considered. Surely it. is an ordinary commercial proposition for a manufacturer with a comparatively limited home marketto export in large quantities, and at a lower price than would he charged for home consumption. There is nothing unfair or wrong in the system. It is merely a difference between wholesale and retail prices. </para>

              <para>- That is so. Such a system of keeping costs on an artificial basis prevents many persons in Australia who are carrying on developmental work from obtaining necessary articles at a reasonable price. The subject of dumping requires careful study, apart altogether from the stand-point of prejudice from which it is frequently considered today. It is one which the members of the board, as men of character and ability, ought to be able to thoroughly examine and report upon. </para>

          <para>The only other point to which I wish to refer is the remuneration proposed to be paid to the members of the board. On the one hand, it seems only right that they should be paid a. salary for the services they render, and on the other there does not seem to be any valid objection to the payment of fees, which provide an assurance of continuous work. It is difficult to say which is the better course to adopt, and the proposal in this instance is only a compromise. Since the Tariff Board is really intended to hear appeals from the decisions of the department itself, &#39;it should be entirely independent of departmental control, and the  chairman  should not be an officer of the department. There is no reason why the board should not have the full benefit of the experience of officers of the department, but the decisions should not rest with an officer who is concerned in the administration of a public office in&#39; which, as a matter of duty - I cast no reflection on the officer - he is bound to carry out the instructions given to him by his Minister. I join with the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> in saying that the bill does not appear to bring about a very satisfactory re-arrangement of the functions of the board. It would be better if new principles were adopted and a new conception of the duties and responsibilities of the board arrived at. </para>

            <para>.- The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> is of the opinion that there is ground for fear regarding consultations between the board and the proposed Director of the Bureau of Economic Research. T assure the honorable  member that I have fear as to not only the director, and the provisions in the bill which lay down the procedure whereby he may be consulted by the Tariff Board, but also the whole fiscal policy of theGovernment. While the bill provides certain machinery and fixes the payment to be made to the members of the board, I am wondering what is in the mind of the Minister for Trade; and Customs regarding the altered functions of the board, which were mentioned by the Prime Minister. As I understand that the Minister is prepared to adjourn the debate, I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>
